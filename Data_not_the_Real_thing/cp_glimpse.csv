hey what's up Jeffy here and today I want to address a question that I see and I hear all the time and that's from guys who don't have wingmen to go out and game with and these guys ask they say you know how do you get comfortable going out alone like what are some strategies that you might employ when people now before I answer this let me just say that I personally have gone on alone many many a time and I'm sure I'll do it again because remember here I'm not just like some dude writing for men's healthier they got a sign to write an article about picking up girls but who actually has no freaking clue fucking clue what he's talking about so when you see me or hear me saying something about this stuff that's because I've gone out and actually done it like a thousand times before I feel as though I can even speak intelligently about it and if that's the kind of experience that's the kind of stuff that you like to hear and you actually want the unvarnished truth of what it actually takes to get it done up there then I would implore you to take a second and like and subscribe to this channel to get that real talk brought to you every Tuesday every Taco Tuesday so again I've gone out alone I think you can be very good a very good thing I think it can build character I've said it's it's good for the soul why because ultimately it's just you and the night and what does that mean when you're out by yourself there are no excuses there are no rationalizations for your failure except you versus the night now here's the thing I don't think that going on alone is something that you should literally do all of the time you should definitely be striving looking constantly for good wings who are going to go out with you who are gonna push you we're gonna help you with logistics for example if you're out there and you're talking to a group of two girls much much easier to pull if there's actually two guys talking to those two girls furthermore I believe wings can provide invaluable feedback insofar as your sticky points things that you might have blind spots etc etc however you must also become comfortable going on alone in the short term and people tend to have this wax set of beliefs around going out alone like for example like it's full loser or something and here's the deal anyone who has travelled anyone who's actually gone out traveling the world and actually had fun well they're used to going out alone and that's a fucking fact like if you decide to backpack around Europe which is a fucking pimp thing to do by the way that means that you're gonna be going out alone you're gonna be meeting people at these hostels making friends you're gonna be going out partying with people and this is not lame this is socially accepted that's actually one of the coolest things that a person can do now beyond that I mean I could give you a ton of lines that you could tell people in case they ask you why you're out alone like oh you know I'm meeting some friends they're running a bit late or you can even go like full sarcastic about it like yeah I'm a complete loser I have no friends please be nice to me you know like I said I could give you a ton of like lines and gambits but the thing is this you've got to realise that going out alone is actually a dominant money behavior like honestly it is a cool behavior when I go out alone and people ask like what are you doing here alone and I'm like yeah I'm just here by myself I get one of two responses first if it's a guy asking they'll probably say something along the lines like damn that's awesome I wish I had the balls to actually go out alone or secondly if it's a girl they'll oftentimes start qualifying themselves about you know like I too can do things independently and I don't need friends to feel like you know something's okay blah blah blah blah blah that kind of angle so remember in my opinion the number one rule of game is what whatever you feel they feel that is the number one rule of pickup people are gonna look to you for how to interpret things so if you feel all chode like oh you know I'm a loser for going out alone then guess what you are right but as soon as you get older that hang up and you realize that being able to have fun by yourself is actually a cool alpha trait well guess what others are gonna start seeing it that way as well and you know for the logical guys out there consider this being internally centered is actually a very solid very attractive trait meaning you know look at somebody who does not have a shit together they're gonna be very very dependent on the company of others in order to feel good about themselves right and interestingly enough this is one of the ways that being so beta so-called actually serves you in in the sense that it ingratiate you with others so that they'll actually satiate your need for constant companionship constant company and on the flip side take a look at somebody who is very internally centered and you'll be struck by just how little their need is for you know ego based self-expression and the companionship of others so well of course they relish and probably enjoy hanging out with their friends they're not actually dependent on it and when we talk about masculine polarity this is what we're talking about right being who you are being on your path and you know letting those around you actually join in on that path and a necessary part of this is a willingness to be on your path even when others don't join in so just as with girls the central tenets of leading successfully for example is to be indifferent to whether or not she follows that is you know asking do you want to come to the bar with me as weak versus saying let's go to the bar right and you just start walking without even like looking to see if they're following so the same principle applies on all aspects of your social life so with everyone in your life it's not like you know come on I want to go see the The Avengers movie will you will you please come with me instead it's like hey I'm gonna go see Avengers it'd be pretty cool if you came with so start doing this in general and you'll be amazed you will be absolutely amazed by just how much people respond and ultimately actually want to align themselves with that high degree of certainty that you're expressing in your life now that's actually going out alone so when I met alone and someone asks where your friends I'll answer up probably at home right and what I'm really saying here is you know I wanted to go out tonight and I'm a man on my path I do what I want when I want period and I'm not dependent on the little security blanket of having to go out with others of course I don't actually say that verbally out loud but the self is always shining through and when the girl you know replies like oh that's cool what she's really saying is you know I'm attracted to people that can make their way through the world independently of others and who aren't you know subject to the whims of what others think about them in other words I'm attracted to a leader not a follower but then of course she's not saying all that verbally either so think about who you are think about the person that you'd like to be and act accordingly and that's really the ultimate message of RSD right to put you in control of your life where you're no longer completely at the mercy of the environment you know completely at the mercy of these competing social pressures and it's what we teach at all of our programs and what we specifically work on and our live hot seat events like our hot seat transformational experience event for example and if you don't know what the hot seat is basically it's an eight-hour live event that comes to your city and during the event we show massive amounts of infield footage with instructor breakdown to give you a very crystal clear knowledge of what high level pick up so to speak actually looks like and consists of and then we follow up all that infield footage with several hours of transformational exercises that are designed to put the spotlight on the myriad ways that social pressure is affecting you and then actually give you and install some cool tools that allow you to push it off so that when you go out you actually feel that pressure you don't just freeze up and go into this kind of paralyzed mode you can actually realize what's happening and then you actually have the ability to push back stay expansive stay out of your head and then actually take action and be effective as opposed to getting shut down so again you can go out to be effective in there and actually hopefully get some love in the night so you can check it out along with some of our preview videos for the hot seat at Jeff Nihon c-calm anyway again mr. Ferber be a boy and I'll see you next time,-Aiu_jxLWmk
yo yo yo what up bitch I your proverbial boy Jeffy and I'm here today in naive and Copenhagen Denmark and what I wanted to talk about today is the concept of feeling toxic to people in your life and this is something that I've struggled with like feeling that I've somehow having a detrimental negative impact on people around me by virtue of who I am or how I may be perceived by other people and you know I to give you an idea what I'm talking about here as you may know our ski we've had we've been embroiled in a variety of little media scandals from time to time I personally had one back in 2013 Roberts portrayed pretty negatively and as a result of frankly kind of like dickish behavior on my part but the bear fact matter is this ended up impacting people in my life and it was it was one contributing factor actually to my recent breakup last year because I was banned from the continent of Australia and in one article like in the Daily Mail they actually mentioned he goes out with his girlfriend and her friends forwarded this to her freaking out that it was going to affect her career in Reverse way and blah blah and and look you know I'm not going to say that that was the only thing that led to the break-up there's like it's obviously more complicated than that it always is but that certainly did didn't help let's just put it that way and I've also had you know in the wake of that certain friends I'll be going out with them they're like you know I'm filming and they're like well don't put me on camera I don't want to be on camera with you so I want to be associated with that and get wrapped up with it you know the stink of you know the negative media associations for that and so you know in the wake of that it kind of really led me to think like damn is there something wrong with me you know maybe I'm fucked up maybe I'm a toxic person and it was really it's really painful to think of yourself like that you know to have that perception of you now for the average guy you probably don't have like a media scandal but a lot of guys do struggle with this in more subtle ways like feeling toxic I perhaps you had a reputation for behavior things you did in the past you know obviously we're in self-development RC that's what it's all about but you know not everyone's coming at this from like some squeaky-clean super nice guy background so maybe you're struggling with that in your you know in your town or in your social circle and maybe if you were to go if this girl were to go out with you her friends would give her shit like all your going out with that guy what the fuck did I yo tisk tisk tisk or maybe you're afraid that you're just not good enough maybe toxic in the sense of you're not good enough for like her family or her friends or you know make enough money for her or you don't you're not good-looking enough for her maybe you're the wrong race and you're afraid that like her peer group will judge you you know be judgmental because of that and beyond that this also kind of holds true for anyone who's just kind of like putting themselves out there in the public sphere in any way who's like planning on going on say YouTube for example and expressing themselves or expressing themselves artistically perhaps or just trying to be again expressive in society and we see even normal people no one's immune to this you don't have to be some weird public figure even normal people have been sucked up and we've seen this in the past for example if you're red Ryan holidays book or no not Ryan holidays book I forget who the authors but it's called so you've been publicly shamed and he details several accounts of people who normal people who got shamed on the internet for example justine sacco with some girl who made a bad joke she was going to africa and she tweeted while she's on the plane going to africa hope I don't get AIDS someone Twitter picked up on this and her life was destroyed she lost her job etc etc so again just because you're not some public figure doesn't mean you're immune now the interesting thing is this I think that last year was the first year that everybody really saw how fucked up the media is and how you know the whole fake news thing and so on and so forth and it really opened people's eyes that a lot of times these are just outright fabrication is designed to get clicks to sell a narrative so I think if time goes on this is going to you know people can have the wool lifted off their eyes and they're going to be less likely to jump to conclusions based on hearsay and what other people are saying but aside from all that one of the big things is this you have to get at a point where you address what's legit right because look yes a lot of the stuff that was written about me back in the day was a complete fabrication like people were making shit up at rigging false quotes to me and stuff but at the same time I was kind of a fucking dickhead okay and I said a lot of ugly things to a lot of people I mean back in the day I used to think that I was Batman and if some girl did something untoward or something that was not cool or flaked or something like this I would feel the need to call her out in a very like brutal psychologically damaging manner in order to like make her feel bad about herself because I figured if I don't do it she's going to do it to the next guy and he's not going to be as resilient as me well of course looking back in retrospect I saw wow you know that really isn't how I want to live my life right that isn't the person I want to be I don't want to see myself as the villain so I began a process after that you know self-reflection and detoxification of the brand right of my brand quote-unquote enemy of your brand so you want to look at what's realistic like what can you change obviously you're never going to be make yourself a different race okay unless you're transracial like Rachel Dolezal or whatever or you're never going to make yourself taller barring some kind of like bizarre bone lengthening surgery that's extremely strange and bizarre like I've got a science fiction disaster however look at areas where again maybe there's some truth to the toxicity and take pains to move away from that because that's where true self-esteem comes from is when you're living up to your own values it's one thing to just go around and say I'm the shit I'm fucking awesome but you know if it's not rooted in an adherence to a set system of code of conduct values ways that you want it to the view you right where do you want to be view the image you want to put forth then it's not going to be legit and when you get that sort of core confidence that comes from living up to those standards that's when you have that true ability to be indifferent when you're doing an approach when you're approaching a girl in the club for that matter you're not you're no longer concerned about do they like me do they like me because you haven't aware is that everyone does not have to like you that's when you get that hot guy blase that you see max talk about a lot and you'll see all instructors have this if you watch our in fields you know we go from we we're very chill we're just putting ourselves in that middle space and allowing her to come meet us in the middle because again I know I'm for some not for others and I'm not looking at it as rejection I know I value myself I know the value proposition that I to the table so if she doesn't like it and again I also know that I'm executing proper outer game mechanics so if I go up and I know she doesn't like it it's no skin off my back because I'm not looking at it as rejection I'm looking at as lack of chemistry and I've have to talk to ten people to find the people that I have chemistry with I can absolutely do that and of course look going beyond that there's a certain amount of compartmentalization that needs to take place I mean realistically for anybody putting themselves out there this shit kind of comes with the territory if you're putting yourself out there fully you can't expect to have the same relationship options as the average Joe so you know if she's in the situation where she her career or whatever her period what-have-you it's a situation where she feels that she can't put you first then truly the best option is to just let her go and find someone who's not now going beyond that you can almost kind of use this so-called toxicity or edginess okay as a sort of filter and I call this the zero screen and if you have seen execute the program my online game program that's one of the major components is screening and I've learned this over in many many years and this is why I won't go out with a date if it seems wishy-washy and like guys are like we'll just go along the date it's like no look I'm 40 years old I've gone on thousands of these dates you can listen to my advice or you can make your own mistakes I get it it's your choice but I've seen time and time again I'm not going I'm going to screen my very hard and the zero screen is what I call your personality right your personality your demeanor the way you can for yourself the way you wear your dress is all it all comes together to be what I call the zero screen right which a girl isn't going to be interested unless you know she's down with that and then of course you want to shift your mentality it's not toxic it's edgy it's out there and use that as a screen to see how you know loyal and committed the girl is actually going to beat you so it's kind of interesting because you'll find yeah there are a lot of people out there okay there's a terribly ins of people in the world and if if you're going out a lot you're eventually going to find someone who's relatively normal who's going to be down with that and many people they they like a little bit of that in their life right they like to have a little bit of out-there edginess in their life especially if they are so-called normals because they can take kind of like a little walk on the wild side so to speak and you you're just different you're so different you're different than everyone else you're out there you're edgy again making sure you're detoxifying where you can but by the way a lot of lunatics will be into this as well and I did have mistake of the past like straight up Looney Tunes girls so you it's important to screen for that too but again like I said there's plenty of people out there and you've got to go out and that's the thing you've got to make a decision to actually go out meet people and engage and be okay if not everyone is down with you ultimately this isn't about caring what other people think it's about deciding proactively the image that you want to project to the world and instead of like just being in reaction and having other people put labels on you you're more you're more in charge of that right you're actually more in charge of that and you're making a proactive decision so you're at what the cause not the effect of your life and that is really the mission statement of RSP is to help you become move towards that place where you're at the cause not the effect now one of my favorite books a really slim volume is called letters to a young poet by Rainer Maria Rilke who is a German poet and it's a collection of letters that he wrote through this quote-unquote young poet who asked him for advice who asked him for critique his poems and the gist of it is this he said don't look at criticism right do not look to criticism look inside and make sure that you're true to yourself emotionally and to me that's the most important thing you can do when you're going out and express yourself is make it real because there's that power and authenticity that helps you connect with other people and people appreciate that when you make it again make a decision for the lake to them on a real level not through these filters of insecurity this defensive posture and when you you're like that it's just so appealing to people because it's so different and again they think maybe if I hung around this guy I could be a little bit like that too so again long story short you know you can decide to be a little bitch whine and complain or you can wave your freak flag high and let the chips fall where they make and there was a brilliant quote from that collection of letters from real kind I'm going to read it right here to now to kind of end this out he said perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us acts just once with beauty and courage perhaps everything that's right is us is in its deepest essence something helpless that wants our love anyway this is geppi I'll see you next time [Music],-Qblx90eEts
what up what up Tsuboi cheffy here coming actually from Austin Texas today to bring you some of the most valuable secrets of social interaction ever to grace a video blog just kidding this issue I'm gonna give you some of the worst advice that you've ever heard so let's get to it [Music]  everywhere right  live music capital there's always a trail trouble and bylaw because it happens the world need bad news not in this pretty racist but there's a lot of bad musicians here as well [Music] if they can't make it Nashville this right here in my travels and my work with real social dynamics I mean a ton of students Court is starting out in the game and there are certain things that they inevitably struggle with during this nascent period of player dumb if you will and one of these universal problems involves reconciling their newfound attitudes with a lot of old cliches and so-called conventional wisdom with regard to dating that they once held as truths and what I mean by this is that over the years we tend to accumulate a set of beliefs with regard to social interactions especially interactions with the opposite sex that sound good on paper but when push comes to shove a lot of these beliefs turn out to be empty platitudes that can actually end up working against you so as you grow and you become more socially intelligent you learn to recognize these old cliches for what they are you may even come to a point where you start to actively work to eradicate the behaviors associated with them like the guy will you know think to himself you know all that stuff is bullshit you know weak social conditionings bullshit that society puts out you know to throw people off the track and now you know now I'm a real player and I'm not gonna fall for that shit anymore but the funny thing however is this behind all of these apparently ass-backward cliches that we've you know we've all heard ever since high school about the best way to go about picking up women there exists an element of truth okay and these are the hidden nuggets of wisdom that only someone with a real world understanding of the mechanics of game can pick up on no pun intended so what am I talking about here let me give you a couple of examples come first off there's that old admonition you used to hear constantly from your teachers and parents when you were a kid and that's you should think before you speak okay and this is one of my favorites my dad used to say this shit to me all the time as a little bit of a smartass back in the day did surprise surprise and my dad say this ought to be able to all the fucking time he'd be like boy you need to learn to think before you speak okay makes sense of course you know an rst oftentimes you'll talk about well we'll talk about not state not saying stupid shit quote/unquote and you know that there is obviously an owner of truth that but the problem is this a lot of guys getting way too wrapped up in this especially when they're interacting with women for example you have a guy talking to a girl at a bar and he's sitting there and he's talking to her but in his head he's always trying to stay two steps ahead to ensure that he doesn't say the wrong thing and blow it okay it's like he's garry kasparov or something trying to defeat the IBM deep blue supercomputer in the chess match of the century you know he's contemplating every possible move and permutation in advance so he'll be ready for it got to be ready right wrong okay it's ironic because when you're constantly trying to stay ahead in the interaction you actually end up sabotaging yourself now what happens is this by not focusing on being in the moment you end up killing the vibe okay now when pick up rhythm is so important it has to be paramount to success so no rhythm expression confidence these things are all intertwined okay so if your mind is always 30 seconds in the future well you're gonna sub communicate bad things about yourself like think about it why would someone secure and their abilities be worried about screwing up so think of it like this it's the difference between a novice guitar player struggling to remember which notes to play next and Jimi Hendrix just riffing and flowing straight from the soul you know if you've ever listened to a live Hendrix album you know what I'm talking about and if you haven't I would suggest you stop watching this immediately and you download some and listen to it for the remainder of this blog my personal favorite is I I'd have to say the live at Winterland album absolutely amazing but anyway so you know again with the novice verse Hendrix one sounds stilted and awkward and the other sounds honest and soulful and you just can't help but be drawn in so by walking on eggshells and being concerned about what others will think of what you say you're creating a gap between your true self and the persona that others see okay so this gap exists within everybody and in people who are highly charismatic the gap will be so small has to be insignificant and there's literally no difference between what they feel inside and what they're projecting out to the world and this is universally attractive to all people so back to the original point guys getting to the game and they learned that this advice is let's say not-so-good and as a result they dismiss it outright as chump conditioning okay but as I've come to realize there's some hidden treasure in the dung heap okay as I've gotten more and more experienced up in the game I've loved a field intuition my sort of heuristic field intuition about practically every scenario one might encounter and this intuition is basically my brain instantaneously comparing the situation at hand and gets all the information gleaned from ten years ago in hard in the game and when you get that many interactions under your belt well you got quite the preponderance of data to draw from you know to put it lightly so this readiness this readiness and this ability to respond dynamically is something that gets instilled in your firmware so to speak over time okay it's not entirely conscious like if you think back to when you first learn how to drive a car at first all of the parts seemed totally discrete and it was difficult to see how they mesh together in a meaningful way you know you're like oh I have to move the the clutch and then I have to move the stick and and then I have to rillette off the pedal and then I also and I have to worry about the turn signals and other cars coming and the rules of the road and and all this stuff but after years and years of driving experience it becomes second nature how all the parts move together okay there's still conscious effort and a need to pay attention so you can respond to changing situations quickly and in the appropriate manner but now you're actually responding to things as they happen as opposed to attempting to juggle every scenario in your head okay so you're more present to the moment and this is required for any sort of empathetic connection okay when you're when you're doing a pickup it what it does is it shows that you're paying attention to her to her subjective emotional experience which causes that good me you communication as opposed to sort of like Asperger's meet it communication where you're not actually communicating with her as a person in front of you but as some sort of rather some sort of agentic means to an end and you're up in your head thinking about how to how to micromanage for their perception of you or how to manipulate the situation to where you want it to go so so when you do have that actual me you can actually knew what your present it's what it does it shows that you're actually your real okay you know I can go up and I can do some crazy open or something like this you know say you say some crazy outlandish shit you know people oftentimes they think of me as like Oh crazy Jeffy you know but at the same time I'm also more present and real in the ways that actually matter than most other guys she's met and almost certainly more than the guys she's been at night at the club okay so for example I'll be talking to a girl or a group of girls and they'll say X and whatever and what happens is that my brain searches the database for similar experiences and brings back two suggestions so note that this happens instantaneously okay your brain is an extremely powerful heuristic computing machine and every sliver of information that you've ever taken in is stored in it somewhere so when this happens it's not something I'm consciously doing it just happens okay one interesting thing to note is that a lot of the time rather than then throwing up suggestions of what to say my brain actually spits out warnings of things to not say or do okay so for example my brain searches the database and comes back in a nanosecond with a warning like don't do that let it go if you do that it's gonna be game over okay we talked about not saying stupid shit and then this is what we mean let me give you a quick example let's say that I'm interacting with a group and someone in the group says something that sets them up for a joke at their expense okay and I have the perfect response for it a response that I know will get people around us falling on the floor you know clutching their sides and agony because they're laughing so hard okay so I get ready to Swit the line out and then all of a sudden something stops me and it's my brain telling me that yes this joke might be the funniest thing I've said all month but it will piss off the wrong person in the group and I'll end up blown out of the set so I bite my tongue and move on sure I didn't get the laugh but I got laid instead oh well you know another example that happened to me recently or that I saw recently I was up in Vancouver and I was with a student and said and there were three girls that three teenage girls gotta love Canadian drinking age and so there's two hot girls and then like a fat girl okay and I'm the one on the left it's going pretty good I'm making out with her and everything and then out of nowhere the guy goes up let's do and he points at the background he goes and you out of here this and you you look like fat Jenny from the TV show like some Canadian TV show that I don't get the reference but but he's like you look like fat Jenny from the fucking TV show and of course predictably what happens they freak the fuck out right they're like flipping out it's completely destroyed right completely ruined I could probably save in line but I was like you know whatever and then so next thing you know I go to the student later I'm like why did you say that dude and he's like you you said have no filter talk with no filter okay within reason okay to a point all right there's something else about common sense so so that's an example the funny thing is though when I first got into the game this this warning wouldn't have come up for me either so you know I'm not trying to hate on the dude but again it's something you have to cultivate you know I would have back in the day I would have done the same well maybe not the exact same thing but I mean I'm a bit of a caustic individual so you know I would just blindly spit out these lines and and and left there scratching my head in puzzlement after I got blown out so basically what I'm saying here is that when you hear somebody say you should think before you speak the true meaning isn't that you should walk on eggshells and you know and carefully weigh every single word that comes out of your mouth think of it like this instead it's more a matter of installing behavioural filters in your head that are gonna guide you down a funnel of choices that lead you to your goals in a given interaction and as you'll accumulate more and more experience these filters become more comprehensive you know you talk about it you hear about invisible threads and that's where you know you there's an unlimited number of things that you could say in an interaction but there's a finite number of things that typically that typically you typically do and when you say something there's an infant number of things they can respond to it but there's like about four or five things that people typically do respond so you learn all those invisible threads and you call to develop four or five different responses each with a unique emotional tenor that would be able to part to the interaction for each of those responses and then and so on and so forth and the tree goes down so that's an interesting it's an interesting way that things develop another another hall-of-fame cliche that we hear all that all the time is that old classic just be yourself right if you talk to any of your female friends about pickup and odds are they'll answer with some variant of this okay just be yourself and everything will be fine at this point many of you are likely thinking to yourself nonsense right I've been myself my entire life and it's really not getting me laid as much as I'd like if anything I need to become different than how I am now okay and this is why a lot of people initially seek out a structure when they come to the pickup game it's precisely because they feel that it isn't enough to just be themselves right or as alex says you are enough they feel that if they just had some more material everything would fall into place and you know becomes a crutch a supplement that makes developing an actual personality unnecessary and it's unfortunate because you know what they're doing is they're misunderstanding the true meaning of the phrase when someone tells you to be yourself they don't mean to keep on engaging in the same old behaviors that haven't gotten you laid in the past and just know shrug your shoulders when it doesn't work out what they really mean is to drop all of the filters of insecurities in your head and start expressing yourself congruently in other words don't just be yourself you'd be a hyper version of yourself you be yourself to the hilt okay people who are operating on a very pure level internally are magnetic it's not about making yourself over into a new person it's about letting go of that which stifles the attractive person that already lies within you be all you can be anyway I'm gonna wrap up here we got a flight to catch but the point I was trying to make is that there are always several layers of meaning to anything that we perceive okay and as you progress and mature in the development of a skillset many of the beliefs that serve you well as a novice cease to do so and I just think it's important to keep the student frame at all times and to constantly seek out those next-level epiphanies that can only come with experience that's what they call wisdom and it's pretty cool until next time get out there and go to work  welcome to Austin Texas you can see here I'm having a local delicacy wild boar and his bison 2005 chilly sort of a better freer oh we got some Kirby Wayne white cheese queso now this is drink of Texas which tequila our case I think those of regional these parts and that's a well he later got my castle we're gonna do some nice dollar that's enough that looks great yes  that was something else wasn't it  I like how we go and separating the chunks  our waitress has been very helpful during this whole process that's right  [Music],-rI7n4cxHq0
Jeffie hey what's up this is Jeff aka Jeffy with real social dynamics coming at you today from Brighton in the United Kingdom a beautiful seaside resorts town getting some rest Swede Stockholm in a big London for now of the hot seat or it's coming up this weekend so anyway I've been travelling around here I've actually been going on a lot of dates I've been on a couple of internet dates I see a date every night I've been here with some excitement in the night all from OkCupid actually I should get paid for for being on a fucking OkCupid but anyway we do a big segment about online in the actual hot seat and I think that it's something that a lot of guys could actually benefit from I mean dude I would never have to go to the club again at this point if I didn't want to I want to but if I didn't want to there'd be absolutely no need for me to go at all anymore whatsoever ever in the rest of my fucking life and I could see they laid every fucking night anyway that's not the point of this blog today the point of this blog today I wanted to talk about a new acronym a new buzzword that's been going around in business circles and it's called a TD what does a TD a TD means attention to detail attention to detail is something that I feel is greatly overlooked in the whole pickup scene and why is that well the bear fact of the matter is this everybody wants the one they're looking for like the one pickup tactic that's going to improve their game by like a hundred percent okay that's why you get things like no the resurrection method and the fucking November chode sequence and was that was like the the Armageddon opener you know stuff like this I think oh if I just have this everything will be solved well the thing is this in reality what good game is good game is actually an aggregate okay of a bunch of little things that don't increase our game by 100% but they increase them by 1% so it's like 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% so again it's a bunch of little things that you know you're supposed to do and you execute them all and that is what good game is ok the cumulative effect of essentially dotting the is and crossing the t's give you a couple examples of this example number one would be say using the girl's name a lot okay that's an old community sawhorse that's been around you know been around forever okay an old community saw you know you use the girl's name a lot you use the girl's name a lot now in reality how many guys are actually doing this I bet if you're watching this right now I'd say about 90% of time you forget the girl's fuckin name okay and you've probably been burned on this lord knows I have so it's funny I was recording Alex treasurer in San Francisco a couple years back and when I watched the video well number one first thing I thought when I watched the video was goddamn I want to be Alex treasurer but the second thing I thought when I watched the video is he's doing so many little things he looks like this crazy like child clown frat boy like running around and just like gamboling through the the vicinity like the Tasmanian Devil but if you look closely he's actually doing a lot of little subtle things okay and one of those things I noticed is he was using the girl's name a lot and if you come to foxy this is one of the videos I show he does a poll a same night Leigh and he does he's you know I was talking to this girl and every time that like he wants to talk over her he'll be like ha ha ha look at it like I noticed wow it does several things I'm like that's something that I know I'm supposed to be doing but I really don't do so I started incorporating that over the next couple of months and I noticed it was extremely powerful like first off by using their name number one it snaps them to attention okay it allows you to like talk over them if they're distracted it'll bring them back to focus right here you know so that's one one benefit of that another thing I noticed is it actually does you know just like they said years ago it actually does build rapport with the girl trust and comfort in connection because think about this it's like it's funny because when I'm using the girl's name like watch this talk to the next time you're interacting with a girl actually like you know remember take the pants remember fucking name but then watch like when you're in the conversation and you've been talking for a little while and then out of nowhere you'd be like okay look Jane da-da-da-da-da and watch what happens to her face it'll literally be like this should be like it's like it's like she's astounded that this guy actually remembers her fucking name you know what I mean because it's so rare it's so absolutely rare that the people actually remember her name so anyway so it builds a lot of trust and comfort connection before at number three and perhaps most importantly it helps you remember the day I'm named okay and like I said we've all been burned on that stuff before another example of something that everyone knows you're supposed to do but nobody actually does is clean the lens wait before you take a video blog  because it was covered in fucking schmutz and hopefully it doesn't fuck up the thing okay anyway so that's that's another thing you're supposed to do but another thing I pick up they are supposed to do okay let's say for example befriending the peer group and I see this every single week when I'm on program every every single week you know especially with new newbie guys even intermediate guys a lot sometimes even so-called guys who have been in the game for a long time consider themselves advanced they go in they just talk right to the hot girl and and they ignore the fat friend now again am i saying that you need to be like playing game show host with the fat friend no and and sometimes with that the danger is that the hot chick old like say oh let's let's give Matilda a chance let's give Big Bertha a chance with some guy so you got to be careful with that but oftentimes all it takes is a general peripheral awareness what the hell is going on with this person's subjective experience okay so go in boom then do that but I'm always paying attention to what's going on over here since this one's about to pop I'm like hey who are you I like this one too did it your friend and I love one another and we hope you approve of our union cool anyway back on simple simple little things the devil truly is in the details of this game you dot the she dot the i's you cross the t's it's gonna be Jeff Lee signing off from Brighton UK aka the Jersey Shore of the United Kingdom a lot of chavs here with a similarly awesome haircuts I really fit right in and I'm gonna go check the computer and see what is on the table for tonight's internet stinking or I might just go out with the guys I don't fucking know anyway back United States next week take care I'll see you then peace  you,-tWFY_md36A
for most a photos this is Jeffy and today I want to give a quick overview of the efficacy of the old-school opinion openers you don't know what an opinion opener is well it's a style of opening women approaching an opening women that was popularized way way way back in 2002 2003 in the early days of pickup okay and back then Tyler did them I did them we all did them that's right I'm basically like pickup Methuselah here okay I've been doing this shit for fucking 16 years you name it I've tried it out personally it's very very extensively which seems as good a reason as any for you to take a little second here to subscribe to my channel to keep receiving the wisdom of the elders on a weekly basis so smash that proverbial like button that little fucking Bell subscribe etc etc anyway I think that you know back in the day I first heard the old hey I need a quick female opinion on something somewhere probably on the old ASF forums back in the day so I tested it out I liked it and I started using it as a prefix to many of my openers like for example I'd say hey I need a quick opinion do you floss before or after you brush okay or oh hey I need a quick opinion you know do you smoke weed you do it before or after you eat and a lot of times they'd say both or you know hey I need a female opinion excuse me yeah real quick is it actually possible for a guy to get out of the friendzone you know because we got this friend and then today and we'd spend like some yarn about it okay and then she'd respond and that was the opener we'd go from there now over the next few years this became used by pretty much everybody okay and these days there I still get some questions on these from time to time especially from new guys who just read the book the game by Neil Strauss and who are just getting in a pickup because those are heavily featured in that book so guys will write mean they'll say you know our opinion opener is still cool or are they outdated what's the deal so I want to give you a few kind of a hundred percent unbiased pros and cons in order to demystify this whole thing and when I say a 100 percent unbiased I say that because you know I'd notice with this top old-school tactics versus modern people tend to have a lot of their own emotional points of view based on their personal style rather than just breaking it down from more of an objective angle so first let's talk about the pros the first Pro to opinion openers I'd say would be you can stop big moving groups of girls and you know if they're walking by it will have a tendency to be a better open than to say hey or you know a lot of other open so that's number one number two you can start conversations with guy and girl groups aka like mix groups without trippin out the guy like a lot of times you're going the guys like hackles will get up I'll be like what the fuck is this guy doing here like etc etc however with this oh it's just a simple lad asking a question or whatever so that's number two number three you can approach at 5:00 a.m. on like a creepy dark Street like we're in some back alley at like 3:00 4:00 in the morning much more easily than going running up to and be like hey I'm Jeff please stop and talk to me and it's like creepy alley at 5:00 in the morning number four you can actually yell down girls from across the bar to come over and answer the question for you and number five most importantly perhaps it gives girls an excuse to talk to you and that goes for a couple things both either lack of intelligence as many attractive girls are quite frankly incapable of holding the conversation however if you give them you know an easy topics to hold on to they can actually speak on it additionally another thing is it gives them the option to say to her overprotective friends like I'm just answering his question so those I'd say are kind of the broad-stroke pros to the opinion opener now the cons to the opinion opener as follows number one it does not call on the girls to be contributed in terms of expending their mental energy so it can be difficult to go from the opener to transition into a more back-and-forth conversation a more 50/50 ratio of conversation so that's number one number two you might get stuck on the opener because you can't think of anything to say beyond it and if you don't transition off this opinion opener fast enough pretty soon the conversation will start to like wine down and once it starts to wind down there will be a noticeable dip in the energy level and the girl at that point has a tendency to instinctively walk off as girls in the club will tend to interpret any dip in the energy as a loss and attraction and a great example of this is the opener that I will give students for a girl standing at the bar where I'll just roll up to them and I'll kind of casually notice them and I'll be like oh hey excuse me which one of these beers do you think will make me cooler or like tougher maybe make my beard grow faster you know I'm trying to be more masculine hahaha anyway hey I'm Jeff and then I roll into it from there so oftentimes I'll have the student do this with a girl standing at the bar and he you know he does it he opens up with hey which one of these beers will make me cooler and then I'll like go around and coach the other students and oftentimes I come back 5 or 10 minutes later and they're still like debating the merits of various beers etc like oh it's a Guinness but did it et cetera it's like dude no you need to drop it like it's a one-line joke okay it's a one-line joke deal meant simply to break the ice so you drop the open then transition off of it alright so that's another caveat number three mentally and this is kind of like a more inner game thing with these opinion openers you might have a tendency to associate this type of opener as the kind that's used by you know one of those old school pickup shows right and therefore you might feel like a moron using it which causes it not to work why because you then lack conviction or even worse you might cringe while saying it so it'll come across as fake it'll come across contrived if you're you know if you have anything but a hundred percent congruence and that can be kind of tricky if the opener is not something that you're actually curious to hear their opinions about so this is true regardless of the opener by the way you know whether it's an opinion opener or what-have-you sometimes all feed openers to the student because they just they don't know what to say at all and I'll give them one that I think is absolutely hilarious and that like kills for me all the time and he thinks it's so stupid and ridiculous and so he can't even open with it to save his life like he goes up and says it and they look at him like he's a literal like insane asylum escapee so the next caveat or con or pitfall to opinion openers is this they do absolutely nothing to teach you social skills in a like non anonymous non club environment so for example say you go to a party and then you know it's a bunch of people in your social circle friends of friends and stuff and you feel this knee-jerk reaction just bust out an opinion opener which causes you to be viewed as one of those weird guys who you got to kind of like keep away from at the party because he just runs around spinning this weird material and you can't just chill with people next it does as a newbie it has a tendency to breed some bad habits because it can make you a bit of an external validation junkie where you kind of can't hold your state you have these state fluctuation issues unless you're getting constant laughs and you know constant buying temperature from the girl if you will so as a result you sort of become blocked from opening by just introducing yourself for example which I have a tendency to cringe when I hear guys say that's their opener but it is a perfectly fine way of opening if you swing through the open after and keep talking until you reach the hook point right a lot of guys let's go and be like hey what's up booboo and then just stand there expecting the girl be like oh hey let me suck your dick right but regardless of what your opener is you need to continue speaking until you reach the social hook point all right so again if you're instead scanning for these like indicators of interest and not getting with them it can actually mess with your internal calibration right even though getting attraction right off the opener is not completely necessary and in fact I'd say that getting attraction off the opener is almost like abnormal right it's just meant to break that ice off so you can continue speaking until you get to the hook point so as you probably know and rst we're always trying to evolve and how we approach the game and furthermore always trying to involve and how we teach and look I still think that the old opinion opers can be cool but in my humble opinion they must be mixed in and taught with a variety of other openers including safe as I said introducing yourself or opening up with absolutely ridiculous comments you know like one that all I like to say is I'll go up and I'll be like excuse me I invented tacos right it's just you know back in the day I'd say like I like salad or I do like a ridiculous opinion opener excuse me I need a female opinion walnuts or Eagles like what walnuts or Eagles what are we using these for etc is suicide completely ridiculous another type would be just going up in you know poking the girl and then just standing there staring at her making weird faces until she giggles and opens you in a similar vein the hand of God where you just like go out there and like deploy your hand and then gently pull her to you when she takes it a situational openers making comments about the environment we're kind of like aggressive almost antagonistic flirtation openers like who are you what are you doing what's in your bag you know or don't look at me stuff like that until you know she kind of gets into the second tag innocent flirtation then you transition off of that quickly before it becomes real antagonism hahaha seen that happen a lot what are some others like complimenting like yes I said complimenting or complimenting like it works okay like you know if you go in showed then explode as we say what's one that Owen does a lot opening by like doing some like ridiculous little shimmy dance up to them like not my style but you know he seems to like it a lot seeing a girl from across the way waving your hands over enthusiastically somewhat like a mentally challenged individual right kind of like I'll and then you know and then when she comes over be like okay or you go over then be like Here I am what are you gonna do with me now right what does a common theme here it's just like having fun with it right so I could I could talk about a variety of other types of openers and and all of these are great but the most important thing is that when you're trying out these things they kind of they force you to believe in what you have to say as opposed to looking for that validation or even looking for a guru like someone on YouTube to tell you that it's a good enough opener the fact of the matter is if you believe in it if you're expressing your personality can really and you're saying it like primarily to offer value to the vibe and not to get a reaction and you're outside of your head well shit whatever you say will work so look I'm really cool the teaching technique a lot like I see a lot of value in teaching technique and in fact my bootcamp per se it's one of the more structured boot camps that I I've seen from the other I mean I've gone on every other RC instructors boot camp and I offer a lot of technique and I offer a lot of structure but you know I think there is a lot of value in it as long as it's not conceived in the students mind as being like the foundation for attraction which it's absolutely not so the big change in the community the pickup community I'd say after the game book came out was you know there was a shift in perspective right before it was believed that techniques and lines were sort of like the magical pill that somehow bypassed the need to actually become a cool guy and so after that getting that that book came out the natural snap back as game kind of became more mainstream was like this abandonment of all technique by a lot of guys because it became associated with like the weirdos who tried to base their game around it like some kind of like Dungeons & Dragons Lords of the nightclub like or as we used to say devious nerds subverting the social order so if you're curious about where I stand on this and by the way I find myself somewhere in the middle in that I'll teach 80% of like how to be a guy who gets attraction by being rather than doing and then about 20% actual technique and methods which I believe is the absolutely crucial 20% that produces immediate tangible results now a comment that I hear a lot of from people who attend my hot seat you know or see my approach to online game from execute the program they'll notice that I do in fact say a lot of the same things over and over again and sometimes this gets me to interpreted by a role or by got a lot of guys as a reliance on routines okay people are like well hey man you know I thought rst I thought they didn't do that stuff anymore that was natural game like what's up right but the distinction here it you let me be clear it like I'm not using these as a crutch because I don't know what else to do or say to get a traction where I don't know how to convey value to the girl otherwise right so the reason that I still use the same statements of intent is to automate that aspect of my game in order to free up processor space in my head so I can focus on what's more in my opinion more important which is what what is she given the emotion there right now where am I in the interaction and where do I need to go like what are the behaviors that I need to act out right now in order to take me to that next step and then of course determining and reacting to dynamically changing logistical situations as they unfold in front of me so that automation aspect that's just one part of that 20% technique that I'm talking about here so bottom line try it out everything must be field tested whether its opinion openers or any technique for that matter okay and that you're gonna find what clicks best with your own personal style and that's absolutely crucial for cultivating charisma which is ultimately what we're talking about here when I refer to quote-unquote being a guy who can get attraction by being rather than doing in fact that's the topic that I'm gonna be exploring in my next big project which is tentatively called charisma mastery and it's gonna be this broad spectrum program to systematically help you develop that and cause me that quality of charisma and I'm really putting a very exhaustive amount of research and development to this you know I really want to leave everything on the field so to speak and make it fully fully encyclopedic with the absolute best exercises on this topic the best teaching strategies other people are just going to be blown away by it okay so it's a bit of a ways off at this point you know like I said it's in the R&D stages but if you want to be kept in the loop you can get on that early VIP list right now by heading over to charisma mastery dot-com so anyway this is the Jeff II and I'll see you next time [Music]  [Music],-xINM1k80UI
what's up this is jeff with real social dynamics coming at you tonight from San Francisco California you can see the Mission District my beloved home behind me and today or tonight rather I'd like to talk about an issue that's very near and dear to my heart and when I say that I mean literally I put out a video last week entitled the n-word talking about narcissism and how great leaders throughout history have that often exhibited narcissistic traits and employed these to achieve their their goals in life anyway I noticed after I put up the video I checked the YouTube comments and you know just to see what the feedback was and I saw the first comment I saw was nice boobs and I was like huh Wow you know there wasn't a girl in the video there was an infielder what they're talking about hmm interesting and then I saw the next one lol moobs all caps and then I realized that in the video I'm sitting there in the chair and we're in a pretty tight shirt and I'm leaning kind of forward and it looks like I have giant moves man boobs breasts male male breasts pachoo gusts as they say in Spanish and I just want to show you everyone here the real state of affairs you know you asked for it and the people want what the people want right so check it out  moto about that shit bitch that's right  so anyway one might think that I'd be like kind of chagrined by this development you know god dammit they're saying I have moves this actually came up last weekend I was down in Los Angeles wearing bootcamp and I was talking with Tyler after the program the debrief and everything and I mentioned him how I hadn't been to the gym in a couple of months due to all the the stress and the workload frankly that came with launching the program he's like yeah I know I saw your last video I was like oh shit him too motherfucker he's like yeah he's like yeah when you're a public figure when you're on YouTube a lot or you're on video you see yourself on video a lot you really noticed pretty quickly when your fitness starts to go sideways and he said a friend of his guy Eric Everhard who's a porn star you yeah you think you got a bad they look think of me I got to look at myself naked fucking I like if I have like a couple of cupcakes that day I'm like oh shit right so what's interesting cuz it kind of keeps you in check in that way but you know what ultimately none of this matters and I'll tell you why I understood that in order to get this work outing and get the program launched I would have to actually work literal 14 sometimes 18-hour days for like six seven days a week in order to really make my vision come true and you know in order to do it properly and I understood that in that time period I I might cultivate a touch of the moves as they say and sure enough that's what happened so I really don't give a fuck my new favorite band is this weird experimental hip-hop group called Death Grips actually either they're disbanded now but it's kind of like skinny puppy meets Pink Floyd if that makes sense what would the emcee being sloth from the Goonies and one of their songs the emcee he actually says fuck where you're going fuck were you've been it's all about where you're at right so this kind of relates back to me to pick up in it in a way because I'm thinking about a student that I had this weekend in Los Angeles and this guy he had difficulty overcoming internal emotional blocks that were stopping him from executing what he knew he should be doing in field to get the result so as a consequence of course he kept getting nice to meet you nice to meet you nice to meet you as opposed to expressing himself in a man to woman way and and that was the reason was because he had certain emotional blocks in place okay and he was kind of boom owning the fact that this was the case and I told him look nobody's got from different cloth you know myself Tyler here who was sitting on the debrief you know we all had to struggle and overcome this and we had to familiarize ourselves with certain modalities such as behaving in a masculine domino polarity things of that nature that we weren't necessarily congruent with at the time and the thing is it didn't matter that we weren't there yet it just mattered that we were taking steps to that end so yeah I got fucking moves proud of a bitch I'm a little fucking panda pasties on I don't give a fuck because I know now that that predetermined time period where I had to do the work has passed I'm gonna get right back to it I'm course I'm gonna ease back into it shake off the rust and get back to where I was before and possibly hopefully better Darcy  you,0GqusR2Vafc
yo yo yo what up this is your proverbial boy Jeffy and I'm here today in Stockholm Sweden in front of the Parliament building and today I want to talk about something that is a pretty fundamental topic in game and a lot of new guys hitting the game and they wonder what are in characteristics that women find attractive what are the personality characteristics and men that are actually attracted to win it well there's a list of these and I think there's about I got about ten of them and I've compiled them here for you in this wonderful video so let's get it started and the number one thing that women find attractive is going to be of course confidence this is something that you hear all the time like you know you got to be confident be yourself be confident but what does this actually mean well my understanding of the term as a guy who's been doing game for many years it simply means being self-assured almost to the point of being cocky right you're kind of a cocky jerk I wouldn't say arrogant arrogant is where you have a belief you're superior to others but cocky just meaning like you understand a deep intrinsic level the value that you bring to the table right you know your value proposition to the girl you're self-assured and you trust your faculties I know that when I go up and I speak to someone if I get like a so-called shit test or congruent test or somebody kind of test my boundaries or kind of pushes to see if I'm congruent with what I'm putting out there I know that I'm going to be able to come back with something that's going to be you know witty it's going to be I'm going to be able to deal with the situation right furthermore I'm aware of the value that I'm bringing to the table okay and this is a huge huge thing so many guys they have zero awareness of the value proposition that they're bringing and I always ask because if you don't know the value that you're bringing to the table why the fuck should she how the fuck is she going to know right about to understand look as a guy who's been doing this for a long time this guy who slept with a lot of girls or whatever it'd be very easy for me and I've slipped into this mindset before where I go up to girls I'm like you know don't you fucking know who the fuck I am how many girls I said I sleep with girls like you for breakfast lunch and dinner you know look that may very well be true but by the same token nobody knows jack shit about your personality or your game and your style what you represent until you bring it to their ass right so it's very important that not only are you confident your abilities you know your value props and you're bringing the table and you're willing to convey it okay so that's number one now number two is going to be humor right funny women always say this right I want a guy who can make me laugh this is almost a universal constant when you ask women what they find attractive in guys so look a lot of us that will Jeff you're obviously you know this funny guy you could go into stand-up comedy judging from your free to her performances or videos and stuff like that look that may very well be the case but I think it's important to understand that is most certainly was not like this when I started it was a skill that I had to cultivate and it is a skill that pretty much anyone can cultivate there's a variety of things that play there delivery timing an understanding of the audience etc it's at an understanding of your own personal style of humor and which what are the different styles of humor and which one resonates most with your personality things of that nature the point is comedy is a craft it is a skill like any other and it can be learned I personally took several courses in this I took workshops I took a stand-up workshop I took improv workshops it's kind of funny too because when I took the stand up workshop I was like the best dude in the class by a large and obvious margin right because I've always been very good at rote memorization my time he's pretty good and it's something that I have a kind of good ear for that stuff how to work the crowd but when I took the improv I fuck it sucked because it's a different animal entirely right it's about like I don't think I'm applied that taught me a lot of things as well so long story short you can learn this stuff now by the way my program resonator actually deals with this part of the program is actually the craft of humor and mastering humor and I delve into the structure behind humor and actually how to go about learning in a very methodical way okay so if you're interested you can check that out rst resonator calm but again number two so we got confidence and then number two is humor number three is going to be masculinity girls generally like a guy who was masculine as opposed to grab some feminine energy now look obviously we live in you know it's 2017 the gender roles are blurring and this and that it's okay for a dude to wear your Flex address did all this kind of shit that's fine look whatever I don't give a shit if you want to wear a romper this summer okay that's the big thing the rompers or whatever go ahead I don't give a shit but I think again as a general broad generalization women generally want a guy heterosexual women generally want a guy who's more masculine what does this really mean what what does it mean to be masculine I think in general it just means you're kind of rugged right you're not a guy that's like a little bitch is going to cry I can't go outside it's raining dirt order to dirt or you know a guy who can isn't afraid to get his hands dirty a guy who is sort of self-sufficient in a very sort of like almost American self-reliant way obviously just on a biological level men are just naturally physically stronger than women as well so just kind of being a strong person in general now look a lot of guys they don't keep it up and they kind of slide into this blue of this like melted ice sculpture this half-melted ice sculpture of their physique by age 30 or whatever and look as I know I can tell you right now I've seen plenty of guys get success who are not in shape you know I've been that guy myself I'm not not to be honest not in like the greater shape right now at this very moment as I film this video but being fit and maintaining like just a general baseline level of strength so I can move stuff like if there's a kitten trapped under a log I need to be able to lift up the goddamn log and save the kitten so again just as general idea of masculinity the next one is what I call nonchalance or studied indifference and this is that sort of hot guy blase that you might hear metaphor max talked about in his videos where you're going up to the girl and you want it to work out with her you'd like to hook up whether you'd like to explore this relationship more however you don't need it to work this is the big distinction and I've said this analogy a lot but it's kind of like this you're here she's here she's got her space around her you've got your space around you there's a space in the middle rather than being super aloof and hoping she's going to cross across to you rather than jumping across that chasm and being like come on come on come on come on come on let's go God you wanna do you wanna do you wanna and putting a lot of pressure on her you kind of put yourself in that middle space and it's almost as though you're like Here I am rock you like a hurricane and that gives her the space to meet you in the middle and she thinks wow this isn't like all these other defensive little guys running around trying to protect their ego it's highly highly attractive so it put something in the middle space and give her the room to come to that middle space and meet you here so again this sort of studied indifference this sort of casual nonchalance the hot guy belazi this is essentially charisma in a nutshell now the next one is leadership and this is pretty straightforward it's just like it sound it's the ability to inspire others to do stuff to inspire others who follow you and to achieve goals together as a team to work it to play nice with other people basically and this is just basic social proof if I like for example if I take a girl to one of my events and I'm there on the stage and there's like several hundred guys there coming up to me saying oh my god Jeffie you're off and you changed my life well let's just say that the sex will probably be very good that night and in fact you know I don't want to get into in-depth this but you know a lot of times when if women attend the events will end up perhaps getting to know them a little bit better after the event as well and that has happened several times again gentleman never tells but still leadership very important quality that women find attractive moving right along here the next one is going to be dominant and what do I mean by dominant I don't necessarily mean like dominant in the bedroom where you're like holding or down and things of that nature more like you're just decisive right you have a way of doing things and you like things to be done that way and you're not afraid to express your mind speak your mind in social situations to kind of like exert your will and get the outcome that you want in those situations and I hear this a lot from girls that I'm dating but like you know why I like you Jeff because you're decisive like when it comes time to be like oh let's go to dinner tonight where do you want to eat a lot of guys will be like well you know I don't know like what do you want to do digital for me it's always like no we're going here we're doing this right same thing when I set up a date it's not like so when are you free what they're dessert it's like so many girls are tired of these like meek little milk with toast guys or just like so do you want to maybe do this or that it's like no hey let's meet tonight meet me at this place let's go here tonight let's check this thing out right again now look this doesn't mean you're not leaving room for other people's opinions for her opinions but again you're not this wishy-washy guy who is afraid to express himself who's afraid to make decisive actions to take decisive action this also ascends to the pulp like when you're going like when it's time to leave with a girl you're not like hemming and hawing about it like oh so maybe do you want to go to this place or it's really cool door de rigueur it's like no-go right that's like my famous line when I do the poll it's not even like let's go it's just a contraction a further contraction it's like go and I just tend to go because I have that faith that they're going to come with okay the next one we call self-reliance and you know again some of these kind of dovetail you could say that this is kind of similar to masculinity in a weird way but when I say self-reliance it just means that you're able to solve problems that are presented to you for example you can land in an unfamiliar city you can figure out how to navigate the public transportation you can figure out how to get where you need to go if your car breaks down you're not going to cry maybe you'll like look at the problem see if you can fix it if you've got some kind of like home improvement thing at your house maybe you know you'll get a little DIY about it research it did some power tools out and see if you can actually fix it right and again this is general belief in yourself that you can handle shit you know when stuff happens you can handle it or at least you're going to attempts to handle it and you know if you can't then you're not afraid to actually find someone you can and bring them into the picture and you know solve it that way as well but it's not kind of your go to the next quality we have that strategy with women is ambition now this doesn't even necessarily that you're successful right now you're mr. moneybags killing it in on every level but what it means is that it you have an awareness of where you want to go you know what your goals are you're actively moving towards those in a concerted fashion right you're not just in a comfort zone you're in a rut you know sitting there with your hand down the front of your pants eating fucking Cheetos cheesy poof's watching Game of Thrones constantly I mean look that's all fine and good it's like a regenerative down period but by the same token you know you need to actually be able to get off your ass and make shit happen in other words this what we call being on your path and I find that this is increasingly important as you begin to get older because again it's very easy to get calcified to get into those ruts and just kind of like just fall off the map and especially as you get older if you want to be able to be competitive with the younger fellows that's what really makes the order guys stand apart is the fact that he's on his past like and that again like I said it becomes increasingly more important as you age and grow as maturity the next one and this is a little bit of an abstract concept is the idea of freedom right you're a guy who is very free you're unconstrained by traditional social restriction social conditioning and you've kind of got this very like devil-may-care attitude like I kind of like I don't give a fuck I don't give a fuck attitude you don't care what other people think you're not constrained by oh don't do this don't go here don't get outside of your little box that has been prescribed for you you know sit down ever since you got into grade school sit down shut up eat your applesauce you know your clothes are dumb don't wear this don't express yourself so again it's most people and you might have heard Tyler say this before go through life in a walking days where there's simply a collection of influences from society and the media and so forth as well as their biological drives right so to see a person who's truly free and who's not constrained by that you know who's kind of like a rebel who's kind of like a rebel a loner like pee-wee Herman in pee-wee's big see that kind of guy it's very attractive because people remember what's the number one rule of pickup whatever you feel they feel so if you are that kind of person who's very free and not afraid to be charismatic and express themself in a social pressure should social pressure situation that's very attractive because being around that they'll start to get a whiff of that too will start to get a little feeling of that too and they think well maybe if I hung around with this person I could be like that as well okay now the next one is actually being a little mysterious right being a little mysterious where she's like okay I says there's a little more than meets the eye to this fella right he's like I'm not sure what what this guy's full story is but I know that there's there's more to the story there's more layers I can peel off and you know honestly I'm fairly I'm a fairly mysterious person just by virtue of kind of Who I am in a sense like I can't like look there's a lot of my backstory that's a little too heavy for a first date you know what I mean like especially you know the stuff with my childhood or you know the stuff with the media or stuff like that nature I might not want to lead with that right it's not to mention the fact that I've been all over the world I I'm much more well-traveled in the average American and so I've had a lot of like stories and stuff like that it's almost an endless depth right and I can plumb those depths and reveal more and more of that as I get deeper and deeper to the relationship so mystery very very attractive quality and kind of tying in with that one his idea of like the bad boy right a little bit of danger a hint of danger perhaps right like maybe this dude you know he seems nice enough but I get the impression that you know he's not totally squeaky-clean you know he might be involved in a couple little shady some shady shit you know there's like the hint of danger so it's like damn you know what girls find out like it's funny because we're not holding media thing happened I got like messages from random people like you know educate W Tyler you're done you're done buddy you're fuckin your little hair in the girls it's going to dry up just like a shriveled mayonnaise talk and like is this true is it going to dry up like my mayonnaise cock right well I found it essentially is that it was a wash because yes some girls would find out about you know the whole the whole hullabaloo surrounding me and they would be like this is disgusting you're a jerk bla bla bla bla bla don't contact me but then other girls would be like this is fucking hilarious and they were like actually quite attracted to that so again for every girl that was disgusted by it there was like an equal and opposite reaction of fascination so that I mean that kind of like really showed me the power of this kind of edginess of being out there of being and again like I said it relates to the previous one of freedom where you're not afraid to kind of subvert those social mores so they're kind of like you know okay so this guy he was like banned from a continent that's pretty weird like what the hell is this they kind of want to find out you know for example another story I like to tell a lot just went up you know if you've read my book 9-ball there's the whole point where I like slept with a whole group of girls like in this girl's entire peer group in order to spite her and so I had a list of five girls and I went through them and I was about to do the last one like when I got to the last one she actually approached me in the club because she was like yo motherfucker I heard about you like I heard that you ran through all my friends like and she was kind of like what's that what is up with this guy what is he doing what is he doing to actually be able to sleep with all these girls right a lot of girls are like that too they find out like I'm just pickup guy or whatever and they're like okay let's see what this motherfucker is all about I want to see for myself right and then they see for themselves and you know a lot of times they're into it right what's the opposite of this like a harmless little nice fellow right it's boring again just like I said this ties into the previous one of excitement you know what the opposite of being exciting like a basic bitch right like a very basic fella who's like a cookie cutter cut out of everyone else so the next one is actually being exciting and having an exciting lifestyle this means you're adventurous you're willing to take the risks you're willing to do things that might not result in success right and the story we always like to tell at I tell this up free tour is the origin on bar SD and when we started this company oftentimes we would land in cities and we wouldn't have money to get to the next city we would help we would have to hope we got enough signups in the city that would fund our ability to go to the next city so again it was kind of like a very hand to mouth existence we were burning the boats but again we weren't afraid to do that we were not afraid of the consequences of going after what we wanted again our mentality was we find the solution right and so this is sort of like that entrepreneur mindset the guy who's willing to go out there try new things take new risks and by the way if you're like a guy who's kind of a bit older in the game this is why we recommend to hang out with younger people find a younger guy who's super excited or if you're starting a business find like a kind of a younger business partner in your mid to late 30s or whatever buying a younger business partner who's going to be kind of like the puppy dog that wants to go on every direction at once and he's going to push you to try different things like let's do this let's do this you'll be like oh that's stupid that's not going to work but he'll be like no come on let's do it let's do it let's do it now again maybe you like discard eight out of ten of his ideas but those two ideas that you actually take to heart our ideas you wouldn't have thought of it all right so in any case being exciting being a venture as being a risk-taker also very attractive and last but not least women like a guy who is passionate okay what do I mean by passionate I generally mean enthusiastic about life right he's not just this kind of guy I was like you know this what do you call it like an emotional flatline man and I see this so many times on bootcamp you know guys are going up to these girls and they're just kind of mad it's like they're not excited to be there I like all it happy eyes you know when I go if I have these like very happy eyes I'm very like enthusiastic and either even if I don't necessarily even like the environment when I talk about being stories for my life I'm very enthusiastic about there's emotional color to it I use different different inflections in my voice I use different variants in my tone I use different tempering for my tempo pauses hand gestures facial expressions right there's a lot of emotional color and passion behind it right as opposed to this hey how's it going how are you dirty dirty dirty burger deserted her right how did I cultivate this look I think it's fair to say I was probably always a little bit like this but over the many many years of doing game what did it teach me it's like look women punished bad game ruthlessly and so if I had found if I went up with a more you know I guess chilled out like spaced out like flattened out emotional effect I wouldn't get as good of a result and so it led me to kind of expand my repertoire of expressiveness now look you learn how to fight so you don't have to so now if I decide to go up and be more chilled back it can actually work because it's coming from a proactive place I'm making a decision to be a little bit more chilled out as opposed to defaulting to that because I don't know what else to do okay so in a chase those are like the 1213 most attractive characteristics for women by the way passion that whole like x-factor that I just mentioned that's a big part of the resonator program if you haven't checked this out already is that RSV resonator calm and this is my program about vocal projection and the program it's in three parts action so it's like a pyramid the foundational aspect is vocal projection I partnered with a Susan dance a vocal coach for 40 years experience and to develop the curriculum for this and so we go over the anatomy the science of vocal projection and then I bring to bear my 15 years of pickup experience and say how we can relate and use this information to generate better results and pickup and I've said this before and I truly believe this 80% of the time when you see a guy who can't hook the set who's having trouble consistently hooking to said it's because his voice fucking sucks so that's number one on top of that we layer the grammar of storytelling which is how to actually tell stories in a compelling fashion no and again in a passionate manner that's actually going to generate interest and have them hanging on your every word and wanting to hear what you have to finish and then the tippy top of the pyramid is the humor and like I said earlier in this video we selves into depth about how to be humorous and got so on and so forth and we've got some infield in their coaching clips we've got some other fun stuff in there so anyway check it out our skewed resonator comm but anyway my last day here in Europe's for phenomenal trip and I'm glad to have been able to brought this bring this video to you on this wonderful day so hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you next time and I would have time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the set set set set 80% of the time this is the problem hey freeze motherfucker a good evening but the way he said it was it lacks a conviction he's like your ha ha ha it has this wavering tonality the voice this is the loser mouth right here not just being loud but being cleared [Music] that's the touchdown right there it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn the stuff but on the level of a long-term health for your bliss you're going to be able to go out and protect her right now I love the increase in my family  [Music],0cj3_rlDRd4
all right what up guys is Jeff coming at you today from San Francisco here with the consensual sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of reproduction van and we've got it parked next to a a school here as you can you can see which is kind of kind of disturbing but nonetheless what we're doing today I figured we've got to do some work on the band here so might as well take the opportunity to film a little video blog you've guys a tour of the van and want to say work what I mean is we are going to be adding a couple of stencils onto the back of the band here today as you can see here this is a representation of how many lovely ladies we have broken off in this incredible vehicle and this very very special 1980 Ford Econoline III 50 with a 400 big-block engine and as you can see there's 15 - a row so we can fit 75 beside 150 on the back once we fill up the back like completely with this orderly disorderly stencils we're gonna then have them begin to kind of like crawl like over the front kind of like like bugs or something you know some of the practice starts to take over kind of but anyway right now as you can see we're at 65 and we recently we had three more three more poles to the van which resulted in sexual congress in the night I had one Randy you had one yeah and and Gandhi got one so so what we're gonna do we're gonna throw them up here real quick and first things first we got this pre-made you know stenciled what we're gonna do and throw it up here line her up  [Music] you know good enough is good enough  next one [Music] and one more  and there we go now we are at 68 we've had this man for about about two and a half years now and you know when we first got up they were they were accruing pretty quickly but you know then we kind of got like stick the novelty wore off then we have a resurgence is and you know personally I'm kind of a traditionalist you know I like a nice bed and everything but in a pinch the Vans fantastic I mean we take this shit camping it's great now anyway let me show you some other features of the van here as you can see we got some some bumper stickers this here you want to zoom in on that here this right here this is an original one the original bumper stickers as you can see it's from Super Bowl Super Bowl 16 the sabbath-school 49ers 1981 NFC champions at - the Pontiac Silverdome January 24th 1982 namasté motherfucker and here we have one less fixie that's a popular saying that says employed here to indicate it's one less fixed gear bicycle on the streets helping save the planet from hipster retardation all right now let's take a little walk around you let's go this way look at some of the salient features of the van here okay so check out the mural here so first things first we got to POC Shakur post it up on the on the van here and if you didn't know any better you might think he was a random Nicaraguan if it were not for this indicating that it is in fact to a Tupac and he should rest in peace forever freedom is not free and here we see that with this lovely memorial this poignant memorial really to this September 11th attacks of 2001 you'll never forget that that day here we have some kind of creature President Bill Clinton in this star field you know you get this whole van here like you get this whole fucking narrow you know and so it's really heartwarming and moving but I also want to do I want to put a hold Dirty Bastard here and then maybe like Jesus here with like hot chicks behind okay and then here we got this what else we got here little um you know representing representing gangsterism now here on the front you see we got these uh these these racing stripes and this metallic blue color this actually adds ten horsepower which is which is pretty cool and so you'll note they go up and they go all it goes all the way over you know across the roof to a lot of hills in San Francisco so you really you know you see it a lot I'm coming around here this is actually the name of the the vehicle it's obviously the consensual sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of reproduction ban but it's also the heart of gold which is the reference to the the douglas adams book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy of course the the ship the spaceship in that that Zaphod Beeblebrox stole was called the heart of gold and it ran an improbability drive and this thing is basically runs on improbability as well so but ellipse candy this you know you see the van gets tagged up from time to time somebody wrote this and you know the other day like a while back somebody also wrote the word fag on the other side and it was pretty funny because I was thinking like I decided to let that one ride and probably let this one ride too but you can see like when the guy was riding his probably like oh man like they're gonna be so mad hey but in reality I just like comped you out I'm like fag yeah and this is gonna stay plug it here we have what would Jesus or perhaps Jeff do also you know kind of peel back here a bit and we got you know this is representative of the San Francisco Giants World Series champions 2010  and and of course easy motherfucking II Eric right rest in peace as well and then we have this bear this is in fact you know herbal from the game actually and his buddy Todd they painted this on here when I was unawares this is the very first thing that went on here I was it was parked in fact probably in this very spot and I came out in the morning to like you know go to the car and I see these people like vandalizing and I'm like what the fuck is this vandalizing no pun intended and and I see him do it and I realize it's it's my friends and they're painting this shit on there you can see a lot of care was put into this this is um it's a Japanese bear called kuma and apparently they tell me it has some kind of significance as a pedophile but you know then again it's from Japan which kind of makes it a pedophile by default so yeah and here we have you know Jesus Christ and this is representative of a Robot Unicorn Attack if you look close here you can see these butterflies are actually three-dimensional three-dimensional stickers and we replace them every so often okay now let's take a look inside the van moving right along come on in  like literally come on in and yes and that is the last thing they hear before their life is changed forever no so uh here we got it here so this is kind of interesting I've had many scenarios where the you know someone was in here having sex getting it on and getting busy and then somewhat lucky there's a student like I had one time I was in here at the park with this girl on top of me like boobs out and then I hear I see the student coming to the mandolin get some get something out of his bag or something and I'm like occupied occupied he doesn't hear any like opens it up and she's like oh my god right yeah so we now use this much like the sock on the door in college right and it's a magnet so if this is on the outside that means that someone is getting it on on the inside let's take a look here so as you can see we got it's pretty well organized here we've got a lovely white mug and a variety of posters here we have an Old English malt liquor beer poster now the put we just have a beer chicks poster here and it was a lot more kind of tasteful it was some girl but like a tasteful little blouse and you know she wasn't even holding the beers she was like it looked like come here and let's discuss books or something and the other hand this is a bit more raunchy as you can see the boobs are out she's wearing some sort of leather panties with her couch on display and she's drinking the beer and she's she almost seems to be saying like let's get fucking loaded motherfucker and if you look closely at her face you know some have suggested that she may in fact be a ladyboy and so it's a a leather pant a leather panties wearing ladyboy it's pretty cool and here we have Purple Rain Prince Led Zeppelin got probably use a little replacement got a little mirror in here for your vanity needs or your insufflation of powder needs if if that's your whatever floats your boat not my thing too old here we got a it's pretty cool this is a an Ed Hardy sunshade for additional privacy up front it says love kill slowly oh yeah this is pretty interesting there's a little picnic table and what I'll often do with this like say I'm seeing some hoe you know it should works during the day well I'll be like hey you wanna have a little lunch date drive down to Demeter downtown or whatever you know wherever she works parking nearby have some sandwiches we'll come down have a little picnic in the van you know bang town USA and then send her back to work and that is how you keep a fuck buddy happy  you know we got a lot of different storage in here you know there's cups plates stuff like that you know we take this out to parties and stuff and it's always gonna have that on hand in here got a little there's this a little weed kit which is always good to have a hand and of course it's all legal in California with your documentation from your physician okay so in here we got this is kind of like from your hygiene needs you know there's condoms you just have a lot more Kevin's have several hundred condoms in here you know we got what we got you know ibuprofen like athlete's foot spray you know toothbrushes various chode spray like deodorant sprays and a lot of this stuff is for the the students because they will you know oftentimes they come on program and they they smell like poo and so that that can help mitigate that and let's see what else we got we got you know I don't know what the fuck this that is some hand sanitizer probably to go with that you know and toothbrushes in Center etc so again you know you're really well equipped to like you know the truth in the package really well equipped to be fresh and so clean now when we kind of switch here and you get up there I don't know what exactly what the hell this is apparently a writing light up unicorn to hump or something I don't know there's always something you know we like to have a lot of little like kind of party accoutrement in here and so we'll have stuff like like for example we got two different kinds of guns squirt gun for water festivities and then I've got you know the the old the old nerf maverick Oh have shit and this is this is great we're at the park because you can you have this you'll have this in you it enables you to basically grab a girl's ass from 30 feet away so that's pretty cool you know these ponies made famous from the SantaCon video full-size spare under another rug here here we got a little Jimi Hendrix action acts as bold as love and a mighty wolf which is used to remind me on a daily basis of the majesty and power of nature which I employ on a daily basis and nightly basis as inspiration for beast mode and let's see what else we got here you know cooler we're not really well stocked on beer right now big is a big weekend but what will tend to keep in here we keep like airplane bottles of booze because though everything is kind of one use so we're out driving around with open container you know we're pretty circumspect especially when with this vehicle which my one friend actually called it what was that a rolling probable cause so you know a little grill this is great for the park to you know just bust it out and you're hauling bitches down hey girl you like meat you like big meat no seriously you like me like me we've got some for you like we'll just holler them down and of course as you can see what I'm lying on here we got you know the bed and you know nice fur comforter here as you sew I can cuddle with my unicorn yeah and it's actually quite comfortable you know a lot of people think it's it's not super comfortable the only thing is it kind of shakes around a lot you know the suspension let's see what else do we got here there's some supplemental lights we got some specialized in fact we used to have these like LEDs under here that would like pulse through different colors was very intense but then Gandhi went to burning then he took a with him I think he lost or something as you can see here I'm also doing something called Operation sparkle door well it started I was operation sparkled Ward you get a shot of those doors in the front you know on both both doors here we got  basically hundreds and hundreds of these little like stickers that used to get when you were in school and yeah something I do I have a lot of free time evidently I probably should be like writing articles for our station but put this ever these dingleberries this kind of reminds me of like if you ever seen up in smoke you know and he picks up Chong in the in the Love Machine the Love Machine and then translate man this is cool you do this all yourself and yes I did it all myself I also we got there at the disco ball fucking party times another thing too if you look at the you know look at the windows back there and you can see out of them but you cannot see in them because we got a mirror tint on the outside through a limo tint on the inside so again even if like your face is press right up against it you really can't see in you can just see kind of like at best some like kind of indistinct shadows sort of milling about so ok you want to pop up here real quick and then as you can see we got the and we got this the curtains hosting Bed Bath & Beyond for when it's when it's sexy time this is pretty cool this is something I got like just for truckers and what this is instead of right there a little ashtray so you know just you know rolling down the road trying to loosen your load about 15 women on your mind you know cupholders blah blah blah blah blah you know Jane you want formats right there down there on the floor and then what we got here this is kind of in my opinion the the coup de Gras the crown jewel if you will of the van and it is the new public address system with police siren and this is great I actually use this to politely request that drivers correct their driving habits and you know what I'm on this shit I'm always super polite I'm not like move out of the fucking way I'm like I'm like excuse me sir can you move your car forward please I'm trying to get by like I'm always extremely polite and there's like what they're just I couldn't feel like talking to conversationally one time I actually did pull the guy over with the siren because he was like some it was like laid there was some drunk guy in front of me weaving I'm like this guy's getting in an accident so I just like lit him up whoo he pulled it over and then you could see like as I drove by Meuse I kind of quit glimpse of his face is like like that's not the cops right yes it's not and unfortunately then I was like I couldn't figure out how to turn it off so I drove for like six blocks with the fucking siren odd which is a bad thing it's actually a felony it's called impersonating a police officer yeah that never happened we never use that police siren we mainly basically just use the PA - again Mike sometimes used to holler at girls but we mostly just use it to say I love balls in a creepy voice there's that anyway um thanks for taking this tour of the van with us and kind of what I wanted to get with this is is you know this band the idea for this band started as a joke between us and our friends and the next thing you know a couple weeks later it became a reality and I remember when I was driving around in this thing at first when I first got it I was tripping I was like I was like that's this is it you've gone fucking crazy now you're crazy now you're driving a fucking rape van like yeah I had trouble sleeping at night I was like dude like you're gonna get in trouble like Derrida dinner in reality no one gives a fuck and now two years later I don't even care I'm slaying her from the door of the van like I forget that I'm driving it was like a strange band in my like what I'm driving around in this I think I feel like I'm driving like a Toyota Camry or something and I'll see people like taking pictures of it on the side I'm like why are they taking I'm like oh right yeah anyway kind of the point of that is what you think or you may feel right now is kind of outside of your reality whether that be you know interacting with women in a way that's going to get you more success with your financial future whether that's or work out anything what what seems unnatural and like you know maybe even uncomfortable to you right now given enough time can become completely commonplace second nature and it'd probably be less time than you think right so basically dare to dream having said that this is Jeffy thanks for taking the tour of the band with me and I'll see you next time [Music],0fqKHluYLgw
so much around amok you can see he uses a lot on the dark side of me he he we're seeing that shit the fucking a Brian McKnight you know that's on one last cry okay room I think one last gay is what we change it to because we had a friend of mine he was gay and he said to not be gay anymore and so he would sing the song by Brian McKnight one last case write up a fuck with that much because it's like making the shit like shake like fuck okay so how does that song go it's a yes I can come on what what is it broken nah my broken heart and shattered dreams oh man he's like no I was something was ever gay he's like one of the least gay dudes I I know but he does he did fuck lesbians quite a bit back in the day were to get calm guy he worked at a place called gay calm and it was a I guess a web portal for gay media and it turns out he he fucked one of the lesbians that worked there and after having done this like a month later or something like that a while after this another lesbian came to him and said something along the lines of oh I heard I done heard about you you know someone so told me about you and said you're discreet said that you're discreet so basically after he hooked up with one lesbian she was getting like her lesbian friends like referrals to him and I was wondered like how and then over the course of the next couple years he went on to like baying like a shit-ton of these lesbians all like look many through these referrals and you know he I think you know he's kind of like he's like a short dude I don't know maybe kind of feminine-looking to them or something so they could pretend and he has a dick and he's like I'm like so what's the secret he's like well first of all he keeps his goddamn mouth shut you know he doesn't fucking talk he's not fucking talking telling tales out of school about it because the thing is if they fuck like some dude and it gets out they could like lose the card you know cards revoked to L the L card you know they they loot they don't dare you know you're something to get handed a tell well they get 2l taken away so it's like you know the discrete thing was important and I'm trying to think what other like little nuances that were came into play yeah so he said it like that and again this is just his beliefs this isn't my beliefs and was telling you what he he thought basically he uh he would what the fuck did he say he had this whole theory as to about lesbianism that he's like look every loves me ending she's like dyed-in-the-wool like at some point they they need a dick I'm like oh okay continue with this theory he's like I don't care my take might be at once a month it might be once every ten years but at some point they needs a dick and then I'm there to provide that service for them in a discreet fashion like oh okay and then he had like these other theories like you notice the lesbians they always have like a big dog like oh why do they have the dogs like cuz they fuck the dog or they get fucked by the dog and so he's got all these strange theories this guy is a very interesting fellow and he his life is very strange and I'm actually writing a book about this dude but he's not being very forthcoming with the fucking interviews cuz every time I'm like that's the way I do it I might get the dude drunk like I just get them fucking wasted and then I like set up a recorder and then I'm like okay talk dude you know and then you just like talk so we're we're slowly getting through it's going to be very exciting it's going to be very exciting this guy's like the guy is full of LA because he knows this guy says like he's full of lies here in Miami so the wonderful 2017 World Summit I'm here to escape the rain and the pain of San Francisco you know it's basically a hellhole hell on earth and it's you know a terrible what he called it a terrible fucking disaster it's like an act of God I see people are marking themselves safe on Facebook in the rain the San Francisco rain storm like how big of pussy do you have to be to mark yourself as safe in like a heavy rain like oh shit but I got a heavy rain it almost damaged my my cashmere sweater hmm I get fuck out here with

statement of not ever succumbing to the desire to get a taco anywhere outside of fucking California maybe Texas or something like that it like if you're in a space that borders Mexico maybe but I

I go there it's like fucking garbage it's just like filled with lettuce and all this nonsense it's just like dude just don't you know just don't just don't you know anywho so let's talk some shit talk some shit dudes get some questions listen listen okay ready while I'm waiting for the questions to arrive we're going to sing one last game my shattered dreams and broken heart commanding on the Shelf I saw you holding hands standing closed someone else now lost it all alone wishing all my feeling would go home now gave my best to you nothing for me to do but have one last game one last game before I throw it all the way I gotta get you out of my day my d stop living away I know I gotta be strong coz round me life goes on and on and on and on okay that's enough oh this guy question can you stop singing no but I can block yeah Brian McKnight is dying right now Oh literally is he uh is he fuckin like give cancer or something is he terminally ill i if so please hit like button one like goes one prayer for Brian McKnight you know that one one there you go again we got two two prayers two prayers for good old Brian McKnight so the stewards like you come in to London in May yeah I'll be in London this may I'm doing London each week for weeks in London Amsterdam Stockholm and I believe either Helsinki or Copenhagen I'm never going to Copenhagen before so pretty excited about that like you know one of the rare places in Europe I haven't fucking bin so pretty exciting going to be running hot seat transformational experience there each week and run in boot camps so I you know I I went to London or I went to Europe last year around the same time and previous to that I had to get out there for like five years so I'm really trying to make an effort to get out you know to get across the proverbial pond as they say probably once a year now just to you know keep keep the folks in the loop you know just because you're not in Trump's glorious America doesn't mean that you can you can you're left out you know we're going to make your upgrade again - with Trump yeah if you had to assassinate a man how would you go about doing it what is love baby don't hurt me at what age does RSD kick you out yet you're kicked out upon death there so there are no ghosts in ours D that I'm aware of no you know rapes ghouls spirits phantasms poltergeists creatures from beyond no zombies nothing of that nature so like once you die you done you done no dead instructors Narsee so you know there's that are you enlightened are you enlightened well I do have a light on me here what is this this is a just like an LED i got an LED I've got a couple like just overhead room lights and then I got this whole backlight shit going on but aside from that yeah you know after enlightenment the laundry that's what they say that's a that's a common saying after enlightenment the laundry and what that means it's like look you can go out and have some phenomenal spiritual experience you can get glimpse of Nirvana you can meditate to the point where you feel that you're at one with the universe you can take a you know a psychedelic experience with ayahuasca journey with a shaman in the Amazonian rainforest and you can get a peek into that enlightenment baby even if you become like enlightened even the Buddha has to do the fucking laundry you know what I mean so it's like you might have this epiphany you might have these revelatory experiences but then yeah you still got it like wake up and brush your fucking teeth and do all the things because regardless of how enlightened you are you're still existing on a physical plane you know so a lot of people who have these kind of experiences they struggle with that you know they struggle with the idea of well okay I've had this enlighten thing but now I'm still stuck to this physical plane so but again you know it's just it's part of the whole thing after enlightenment the laundry I always like that I think there's a book actually titled that that kind of delves into that whole phenomenon so if you're interested in that definitely check it out so let's see okay so what we got here is a four inch penis worthy of love sure Jeffy I Love You Man but is this just a rant no game question look at this you see the entitlement of these people it's like because I don't like meal okay so I'm on a Facebook live right now right so there's all these like comments flowing up and so this guy he's like he's not is like notice me senpai my question my question what does my question ghent I will you answer my my he's obviously going on a rant because he's not attending to my little question it's like dude what are you doing you lost your shit that ayahuasca what is this would you rather be a Nazi or in STW this is an interesting question and I would pose this question to you and I've actually been using this as an opener would you rather a punch 300 innocent people and one Nazi or no Nazis at all let's see your answer in the comments would you rather again I'll say it again would you rather punch 300 innocent people in one Nazi or no Nazis at all I'm curious  no one's red no one's answering that one no one's taking the bait no Nazi at all okay obviously this guy's a trump supporter I need my hands so none well yeah I mean punching 300 people seems like quite the effort surprise I'm gay that's why I made this video today I wanted to come out okay my best friend is getting married should I stop him but what is this is I can be like the fucking graduate or something everyone here's probably too young even know what the fuck that is like where you're going to bust in and be like no no and then like right off with her Android convertible or some shit you can steal it steals wife my best friend's getting married should I stop him why would you stop him look I think marriage is a fucking I'm ethically opposed to it I think it's a terrible fucking idea I think it's a it's like an antiquated outdated you know institution then again I don't know the disintegration of a nuclear family you know according to Steve Bannon president Danna this is the reason for the breakdown of our our society in our judeo-christian values but you know maybe maybe there's some element of truth to that but regardless I think that in the modern era I think it's generally a raw deal particularly for the dude and don't I don't mean for you to interpret that as me being like one of these butthurt red pill faggots like whoo you did marry the man you so pained the man the man it's unfair I've stated my case on that I think it's for some people marriage is great I think for some people it works out it's awesome you know and good for them some of my best friends are fucking married sounds like a what a racist would say to like prove he's not racist some of my best friends so my pissed I have like a married friend you know but yeah I think for some people it works out great I mean and people got to make their own mistakes if it does turn out that it's a mistake I guess he's going to find out soon enough isn't he right and the thing as look and this is this leads me to a more important point okay and this is the the actual point here all right I have friends whose behaviors I disagree with who's who is behave nothing to disagree with I feel they engage in self-destructive behaviors okay I have one friend who consistently dates people women that I find reprehensible I find them appalling I find them that I don't like I don't like how they look I don't like how they act I don't like how they treat them but the guys it's addicted to these fucking Bammer ass fucking ratchet hoes you know and I'm like dude what the fuck are you doing man you know you're better than this and I know the guys better than this because I've seen him I've seen him pimp it hard in the past but now for whatever reason he's in this rut where he's dating he's like gross old ladies and she had were all fucking psycho fast-forward to like six months later he's back with her shows up at my fucking birthday party with the but the butt plug golf party or whatever which was awesome by the way um man and he's got this chick with her and with him and I'm like I didn't even crap I was like oh hey you know because here's the thing and I you know I got other friends that do stupid shit they're fucking getting in trouble all the time self-destructive behavior alcoholism poor choices disrespect etcetera etcetera list goes on and on but but here's the thing at a certain point you just got to let them do their thing man you know and and I would rack mic and you want to help them you know because they're your friend you're they're your friend and you want to help them really dude you got to stop this shit and most of the times I be like yeah yeah yeah and then there's gonna do whatever the fuck they're going to do anyway but here's the main point rather than like worrying about your goddamn friend you should be worrying about yourself so when I see my friends with these crazy blind spots and everything what it makes me think is what am i doing what's my fucking blind spot that they keep telling me about Nigel oh yeah yeah yeah I do regardless and you know for me likely it's you know rage attacks right becoming um getting angry too like an unwarranted degree over like relatively trivial things you know and i'ma but I'm very aware of that so the thing is I would suggest you turn inward you know you you take it to a more introspective level where you're looking and looking where am I fucking up not be like oh this guy's getting married should I stop them it's like no we stop yourself from doing your own dumb shit motherfucker right and by the way so having said that let me kind of backtrack to the the birthday party so I was sitting in the kitchen in the morning I was having my breakfast and you know reading Scientific American and all of a sudden my roommate she comes upstairs something dude she comes there she's like Jeff mm-hmm like do you want to do a birthday party for our birthday because our birthday is like two days apart and I'm like birthday party uh yeah sure let's do it plug it it's like okay well you got to plan it because I'm on klonopin boom and then just goes away I'm like what the fuck I have to plan it because you're on klonopin did I just get suckered into like planning my own fucking birthday party yeah I did I got suckered into planning my own fucking birthday party guys don't do birthday you know what I mean like birthday party as an adult that's generally like a like a generally of course you know it's never wise to indulge in generalizations but you know I feel like birthday party like yeah we're going to think it's a birthday that's kind of like a like a like a chick thing you know but regardless I'm like and it's funny too because I've never the last time I actually had a birthday party they must have been like my 35th or something like that and at the time I had a female assistant if she's like I'll do the birthday party and so I'm like whatever so I show up at the place on my birthday and there's like 40 fucking people there and they're like yeah I'm like who the fuck are these people I mean I knew who they were but I'm like Jesus Christ how did she do this I'm like okay yay for female birthday party planning you know aside from that she was pretty useless and then she ended up fucking evil genie after the party and I fired her shortly thereafter not for fucking April Jimmy but just for general uselessness although she used to bring fruit pizza to the dolores park on Sundays which i you know miss frankly but that's neither here nor there so regardless so now it's on me to plan this fucking birthday party so I'm showing my buddy at the bar and I tell him this I'm like yo so birthday party like let's just brainstorm a theme here and he goes he's like butt plugs and I'm like what and I kind of think about it for a second and I'm like all right blood plugs so what I did I I purchased online on Amazon a baker's dozen of butt plugs like tiny little butt plugs and I got the cheapest one from Amazon and they it said seven cents a gram and I'm like holy shit I didn't know they fucking sold butt plugs by the gram I didn't know it was like by weight and then they had like a little like gem in the bottom and I'm like what color gem and he's like you know silver I'm like no no no red so it's like my birthstone so it's like garnet for our birthstone so we get these butt plugs and then so the idea was we're and then we go to the mini golf so then I call it putt plugs like putt-putt the putt-putt so we go to the mini golf and play the golf and here was so here was the rule there was gonna be a cash prize for the winner the pot starts at 200 and then every person that puts the butt plug in their ass the the pot increases by $100 and whoever wins the golf half you know they get the entire pot so theoretically you know there's 13 plugs so yeah it could be $1500 for everyone put it in you could win fifteen hundred fucking dollars but here's a to even be eligible for the cash prize you have to have it in your assets that's a golf and you have to you know show proof and you have to have it in your asshole for the entire time so it was funny because I was like so basically we're trolling people with money because that's know that's a lot of money like 500 bucks thousand bucks shit I could pay your fucking rent so that's like to encourage people to put it put more people to put it up their asshole and so at the place for girls actually put in their ass and they have to show photographs you know photographic proof or just display so they're showing the and then the best part is regardless I still won the fucking golf so I didn't even have to pay haha happy 41st to me how do you get a funnier sense of humor I don't know you probably can't you might as well give up  either got it or you don't kid no I mean um just watch you know obviously the real answer to that is just like watch fuckin comment comments watch a comment watch Halley's Comet when next time it comes around no I mean watch comedy watch a lot of stand-up specials go to if you really want to get good go take a fucking workshop man you know take a stand-up workshop take a um you know improv workshop I remember Tyler back in the day he was not funny this guy was not a funny guy like it would be out at like company dinner and he'd be like you know tell some joke and then like everyone around the table laughter like haha very funny boss you know this is the fucking boss so they're like laughing out of like respect for the boss like a dad joke or some stupid dad joke well anyway long story short he went to the improv school down in LA which is called the OTB theater it's pretty renowned and he didn't just take like the first level he took like all the levels of the improv comedy workshop you know took several months and now if you see his videos and stuff like that you know he's actually funny now right he's like he when he makes a joke it's actually fucking funny now I mean I'm still funnier but still regardless it just goes to show that it's an actual skill that you can you can work on you can improve so again you got to get familiar with tiny you got to get familiar with what makes something punchy you got to get familiar with the ability of free-associate and just let go a lot of guys say you know what's the secret amount running out of things to say what's the secret or how to be funny do I learn more lines and stuff like this look dude lines can be great I got lines up the fucking ass okay I got lines for days I got bars for fucking days I've been meticulously honing this shit over a period of many fucking years okay however I can also do improv why the secret is not an adding on it's a letting go right it's a letting go of needing it to be good it's a letting go of needing it to oppress now again that doesn't mean that you're not paying attention to what people are giving you emotionally and seeing if they're actually responding to it seeing if they're engaged and stuff like that that's an out there's an element of it to that but really you should be trying to make yourself laugh first and foremost right and one of my favorite books it's a very short book by Rainer Maria Rilke the German poet or German author essayist whatever and it's called a letter to a young poet and in this he basically explores the idea that any artistic endeavor should not be undertaken or not the UH you shouldn't write whatever you're trying to write with the reader in mind right like oh is this going to is the reader going to like this is the audience going to like this in in fact the overarching principle should be whether or not it resonates with you right is it emotionally true to you because if it's not if you're like pandering people haven't here for that and it's not they don't respond to it it's got to be real people like shit that's real that's why when I was writing my book I wasn't thinking oh I can you know trying to make myself look cool okay no I just fucking presented it that shit works at all okay and that does not mean that I have genital warts okay just like again the ugly truth the messy fucking truth as a political commentator Van Jones would say but even shit that was a painful and that's why it was so fucking it was such an ordeal writing that book because you know I had I had a lot of the raw material but in order to write it I had to sit there for ten hours a day five days a week for like nine months working on that shit and I would probably cry about once a week at why you ask because I'm like reliving a lot of these like often very painful experiences and in order to I knew that in order to make the book real it had to be real I had to experience it as though I was there again in full in detail as painful of that which may be and you know of course it was it was cathartic in a sense to because you know in a way was home like therapy it kind of helped me get that shit out and then process it in a way that was a little more objective I guess then that I had been processing it but but again I knew that it had in order for it to be resonant with other people that had to be real for me right and so I think that's one big element of not just comedy but like pickup and just just socializing in general with your business your work your friends your family your peer group people you interact with on a daily basis the fucking waiter for God's sake you know it's got it's got to come from a place of authenticity and it's so powerful and yes can you put on you know the sociopathic mask and put on this you know character that people will respond to absolutely and you can get far with that and you can even if the Nagl certain people into liking you but I've arrived at the point in my career if you will where I've like hooked up with enough people I've got enough of a fucking validation I know I can fuck and do it you know I know I know I can go out and pick up a girl I know I can fuck you do that so I don't have to it's like you learn martial arts so you don't have to fight right so again it's not about getting that validation anymore it's more like fine being someone I have chemistry with and if I have to go talk to 20 people in the night to find the girl that I have the fucking chemistry with I can do that no skin off my back I don't give a fuck right because I'd rather have the girl that thinks I am fucking awesome then a girl who thinks I'm so so that I kind of send Nagle's with tactics and trickery I want to go that I think's awesome who thinks I'm awesome and we can go be awesome in our own little solipsistic bubble of fucking awesome this together and then like ejaculate all over each other's fucking face so anywho I just picked up the Ryoka book for one penny on Amazon good good for you readings good I know here in America we have a saying how's it go all right reading is for faggots but I actually read on the daily basis I read constantly and I think that's another reason why I have kind of verbal facility about me you know I think reading fiction even you know a lot of people dismiss fiction I think if fiction is great it makes you more empathetic but I was at my grandpa's house and I was digging through his little shit and like just taking shit of note and I found this book that I read when I was a kids called clan of the cave bear and it's a fictional novel about this like you know prehistoric tribe of people and like a cro-magnon girl her family is killed and she gets found by like a bunch of Neanderthals and she has to like integrate into their society and it's very like it's like a feminist book almost in a way and you know I would never think of that perspective as I'm reading this book of myself these assholes she needs to fucking defeat them today you know so again it puts you in in different experience that you would never have also seeing how different authors flesh out scenes and flesh out internal emotional spaces of the characters and stuff you know words are very powerful I mean shit obviously words words define your reality words give parameters and meaning to your reality and I think one of the best things of having like a wide vocabulary is I can select nuance meaning I can choose a word my word so it's very important you know you know if I want to say if there's like a guy who is quiet but he's kind of a jerk about it I'll say he's taciturn you know so again it's a specific little shadings of meaning that you can really like get at to like express yourself in very very nuanced ways and so you know I think that's part a big part of like learning how to be witty and humorous it's just like a reading again engaging with people that you find funny yet but again most most important above all making sure you're expressing yourself authentically all right so anyway like I said I'm going to hop off here right now I got some work to do before I go out I'm going to work on the copy for the resonator program in case you didn't know what that is quick little PSA it's called resonator any time I put out a program it's something that's like near and dear to my own heart and I've been thinking about this shit quite a lot lately as I had struggled on tour with losing my boys and of course you know a lot of people had tell me myself Tyler etc we have very powerful vocal projection we're able to be on stage and project without amplification if necessary yada yada so I really wanted to dig into the science of vocal projection because I think it gets a bit of a bad rep it gets a short shrift in the community it gets lip service people are like oh you know talk loud put food read from the diaphragm like that's you know positive dominant though that's like all it gets right so I worked with this professional vocal instructor classical vocal teacher Susan Nance she's been doing this shit for like 35 40 years and what exactly the anatomy is doing how to do it in a powerful way and how to do it in a healthy way with a focus on picking up I'm going to have like a lot of other shit in there some infield stuff should be a lot of fun so again check it out our resonator Tom and Jeffy [Music],1O-gcvClZmQ
whether it's learning to play the guitar shooting basketball or even pick up girls even the most positive movies can become frustrated by the inevitable mistakes disasters fucking debacles that are going to encounter along the way now while most people typically view these mistakes as things that need to be eradicated through practice and repetition recent research indicates that these mistakes may actually be beneficial and cause you to actually learn faster there was a study done in the journal Nature Neuroscience back in January and in this study participants were asked to replicate a curve that they saw like a curved line they saw on a paper without looking now they have them do this hundreds of times and of course in the beginning everyone didn't reproduce it very well however what they noticed is that while after again hundreds of repetitions everyone's accuracy improved those people who started out with the most variability and inconsistency at the beginning actually learned to replicate it accurately more quickly than the rest of the people this link between variability and quicker learning was actually bolstered by a separate experiment where they had somebody tried to replicate a specific motor function like a specific hand motion and they introduced an outside stimulus to that to their to their arm over time they push their arm off those people who had that steamiest supplied actually learn to replicate the motion more quickly so the conclusion is this bigger fluctuations in behavior and approach when initially exploring a skill may reflect the brain exploring the full spectrum of possible actions which allows you to narrow in on the correct course of action more quickly so this is why we'll often do things on program like we'll have a guy go up and try to get blown out on purpose right just do something ridiculous right and oftentimes what will happen with that as an interesting kind of side note is when the guy goes up and he tries to get blowed out on purpose he actually has success where before he wasn't even in those kind of cases because why would that be well because he's got complete outcome dependence he's going up with the full expectation that it's not going to work rather than what he was doing before which is going up needing it to work or wanting it to work desperately and so we have success but again that's kind of a little side tangent here it's interesting to think that when we were coming up myself Owen Nick Papa back in the early days of the moderated Usenet forums and stuff like that we didn't really have something like a boot camp I mean if you think about it the artist a boot camp is the product of 12 years of research experimentation refinement until it's finally been wrapped up in this package with a neat little bow that we then present to the student platter and I think in many ways that I mean I'm not gonna go so far as to say that it's detrimental or it sucks I mean I would have loved to been able to you know pay for something like that where somebody shows me exactly what works but I think maybe there's possibly something a little lost in the translation because back in the day obviously we had to go through every possible approach and try it out ourselves in order to arrive at the conclusions that we've arrived at today like this is what works these are the principles that get people to result rather than you know guys today there's just kind of like okay well I'm just gonna do this and I'm gonna go down this path we had to try all kinds of stupid shit you know we were wearing like fishnet shirts with like fucking blinky lights on it and like trying to hypnosis and all this kind of crap and you know direct approach indirect approach yada yada yada yada now while these days I find that these distinctions are largely meaningless or at least a lot of the things that we felt were important distinctions back then are largely meaningless when taken when viewed in context of the larger principles at play I still think there was a lot of value to that you know having to slog through the mud and and try everything out because it really helped us narrow down on what actually work and internalize it now I just today I'm not gonna suggest that you know you just try to blindly hunt-and-peck for the the correct way to go about things in the dark by yourself I mean obviously I I see guys coming up in the game now who get better way quicker than we did I mean we it took us years to get where it would take a guy like say one of the more recent instructors Julian it took him he got better in like a very short timeframe compared to how it took us how long it took us so but you know what's the practical takeaway here for you for you the viewer well obviously I'm not gonna suggest that you go and you do all this crazy bullshit but fuck around man experiment don't just take our word for it and that's always been a big tenets of our SD we're not some fucking cult okay we don't want you to follow us we're not gonna follow you walk alongside us as friends if you come in a boot camp at the end of the boot camp one of the things I'll always say is this is just a set of principles right you're on the meme tree now bitch okay you're on our little meme tree so go out and add your own shit to it innovate experiment yourself okay okay a little expansion here on what you have just talked about a couple things are not than that first of all I'll be talking to students they're like I opened this girl last week what's your analysis on what I'm gonna tell you I'm like dude you shouldn't remember a girl who you open last week you should have done too many opens you can't remember it maybe you know you remember the odds like really unique one but usually I'm like like I'll say the guy's like how many girls have you open this week to like you know what like three or four approaches man okay you should have done so many you can't remember you definitely shouldn't be able remember girls you made out with and girls you slept with maybe maybe you should have had so many experiences that it's a non-issue look by the time you get a really hot girlfriend you should had so many experiences by that point you don't even think about it okay because by the time you get the really hot girls you should just be so much in your own reality just dating different girls banging different girls all you met a great one bang you just smoothly go in like that that's what we're trying to teach you here how does this happen a lot of reference experiences now funny enough to have is talking about having these different reference experiences you get some negative ones it gives you a better array of experience to draw off of to knowledge what does that mean back in the day when Jeff and I learned we didn't have web 2.0 so you didn't see videos of who you're learning from you know these little guys on forum so you have to go meet up with them subscreen man a little screen name hope that by the quality of his articles that that reflects that he knows what he's doing you go meet up with him you try to offer him some value he tries to offer you some value usually if you're new you just try to show that you're very enthusiastic and smiley and non demanding some newbies forget that one and basically I yeah we didn't we could learn like that right so we had to teach ourselves now that was good we taught ourselves because we learned you have to go find the answers yourself motherfucker you can't the bathroom bathroom security aggressive asshole stuff stories random friendly stuff romantic romantic tales tried everything  so what's the advantage here we got to see a wide array difference and we didn't shy away from negative feedback now what was the downside if we'd had videos like this instead of being 12 years deep we'd be making we'd be at this level expert expertise after three to four years so that's why the pickup community as a whole is improving because the knowledge is getting around faster a lot of arrogant people that are really just insecure used to get teachers I probably spent 30 50 grand on educational training since here myself let's see what I'm doing is I'm trying a lot of different stuff and then I'm coming into that training having tried a ton this stuff and then I get training so that's really the magical combinations try tons of stuff don't shy away from negative feedback and then also get trained by the best go right to the top then what you could do is you can actually learn from better quality problems okay you don't trying to get a threesome how do I you know how do I make that happen so you get better quality problems don't get frustrated with wild mistakes and wild fuck-ups and quote unquote inconsistency when you're first learning this stuff and you know that's one of the biggest complaints I hear from guys that come on boot camp they're like you know I'm just too inconsistent I want to get consistency interestingly enough that very inconsistency could be the key to quick improve it this is Jeffy see you next time,1qnny-NTBmI

yo what's up this is Jeff e coming at you today from Orlando motherfucking Florida I'm here with my good friend and fearless leader Owen Cook aka Tyler from real social dynamics and what we'd like to kind of get into today is the distinction between a more quote/unquote canned approach to game versus a more free-flowing improvisational approach to game and when I say can't I want to make a big distinction here we're not necessarily talking about prefabricated routines coming from some sort of deficit to cover your inability to hold a conversation but rather just having a more of structured flow and maybe even telling some of the same stories over and over now Tyler and I were talking about this a bit the other day now if you look at RSD a lot of the different instructors have different approaches Alexander for example has a more free-flowing approach in his approach to a pick up he kind of just goes into the end of the game rolls into a club and has a tenancy to kind of float around versus say for example myself or Julian we're both examples of guys who actually kind of have a bit of a structure like you'll find me or at least I'll find myself saying a lot of the same things I say over and over again and of course these things tend to cycle through like when I stopped finding it funny basically is when it falls out of favor and then I'll get some new shit in but from pickup to pickup on like a you know a rolling three month basis I'll find myself saying a lot of the same shit as I moved through the way points of a pickup now interestingly enough the other day Tyler and I were discussing our various public speaking skills and he actually said to me and I was really flattered by this is like Jeff at the moment I think you have one of the best if not the best public speaking skills in the company when it comes to humor natural charisma connecting with the audience cadence those sorts of things however he's much much better at bringing up new content on the fly and coming up with new content on the fly and I think a big reason for that is our psychological makeup varies in subtle ways for example Tyler I know for a fact he really hates repeating the same information he raves repeating the same content over and that's why in every single free tour you'll see him doing really forces himself to workshop new ideas and things of that nature whereas I am a lot more comfortable repeating the same information over and over for example there's if you look at our boot camps okay we both been doing boot camps for 12 years pretty much every weekend and when you give a boot camp when you meet the students at that first meeting the students you need to give them an introductory speech where you go over the you-know-what of what to expect - the rules for boot camp and as you can imagine by necessity you pretty much have to say the same things over and over and I've been giving that speech every weekend for 12 years okay and it iman forbade them it's like all right guys welcome to the boot camp now there's a reason that we call it boot camp as opposed to say summer camp for little girls okay when you hear the word boot camp and so on and so forth and for those of you have taken boot camp yep I'd like yeah he said that shit to me as well right so for Owen that's like one of the most dreaded parts of his entire job his entire week he's like I've got to sit there and say this bullshit over and over and over again like in fact he went so far as to even consider the idea of creating a video where an assistant shows up and like flips it up and like max fucking head room he's like hey hey this was Owen welcome to boot camp right and you're showing that because he absolutely despised me on the other hand when I show up for work and I start rolling into that I had actually kind of like gets me into the workflow I'm like yeah yeah yeah okay it's time to do work right and it kind of gets me into my flow I actually enjoy it okay this is for example why you can I can go and do say karaoke okay people often ask me well what's your go-to song alright and I reply to them well I was the fucking champion and the champion does not have a fucking go-to song they have a repertoire of about 40 different fucking songs they do however within that repertoire any given one of those I've probably saying about a thousand times prior literally hundreds if not thousands of times prior however when I get up on that stage I don't care that I'm second a million times before you know I workshop new stuff from time to time and I did it last weekend was it actually came out fabulous I probably do it more often to be honest because I mean my comfort zone there but when I get up there I just like hitting the notes you know what I'm saying I like hitting those notes I like kind of way it feels in my body I like the process I like seeing myself do it I like that connection with the audience and everything the applause at the end right that's in many ways just the icing on the cake if you will now to take it back to a pickup like take this analogy back to pick up I I may have said the same things a million times I may have done the same things to garner the result which is getting laid but in reality I like really hitting those notes you know I like that moment when I go up and they give you that skeptical look I'm like hey I open and they're like and then I'm like that under that I continue to beam that like positive emotional like tenor at them and you see them slowly crack and slowly lose that scepticism and slowly come around the first time that they touched me the first time they start asking me questions to become contributed the first time the first kiss right when I go to the poll and I befriend the peer group and then I get back home I deal with the LMR all of that stuff I really just love that process of hitting the notes and so does Julian I know for that matter like when I'm out with that kid I just again I really love gaming them because we're just fucking around we're free-flowing we're like saying our stupid little things like hey are you fat I just want to find some fat cunt to berate so I could get into the zone so I can go pick up a book you know and we'll say this like a million times in a night right but cuz we really just enjoy the process and in fact I you know I suspect that Julian actually enjoys the process of like going out and like trying out these new ridiculous ideas but again and again more than he actually enjoys the sex itself okay again I'm just speculating I mean for me it's complete ops and I'm like a fucking sex addict in fact my business partner tried to have an intervention with me at the local coffee shop which ended in acrimony and tears for his but you know I'm obviously exaggerating a little bit but still point being everyone has a different perspective on this and it kind of really depends which which approach you choose to take for yourself really kind of depends on your own personality and of course as I said before don't be afraid to go out your comfort zone - I love to like on occasion try something I haven't done before my improv and oftentimes that come part of my repertoire in fact so you know choose which one you gravitate towards more but don't limit yourself either and like get locked into that one way of doing things or that one way of thinking now I'm sure that Tyler has some other thoughts on this matter so I'm going to toss him and we'll see what he has to say yeah just a quick idea to throw it on this structure and pick up really depends about where it's coming from a lot of the time people learn pickup theory and they think okay I just get my little lines and learn these techniques and all of a sudden I can open the legs of these girls who would previously be out of my league right yeah exactly yeah I did and and basically that's wrong it's just literally wrong and so what happens is that a structure or lines distracts the person from the interchange work and even change in his outer behavior that is gonna have to do in order to actually get any good at this at the same time there's some people who really enjoy that feeling in their body of just busting out you know some of the same little jokes or same little things I mean it's like say Little John rise like okay you don't shit like that right when he says it he enjoys it so if you're saying the same things or have a general structure and you just enjoy that cuz you like it that's not a bad thing at all that can be good but if you're saying it out of fear and you're saying it as a failure to fix the other areas then you're coming from a deficit so you want to think of say a guy who went out to a barbecue with his buddies and you know he's got some great stories that he loves to tell tell a story this right he just enjoys telling it that's fine so do you feel yourself wanting to tell that story again or you have a general structure that you're using if you're enjoying it that's going to come through conversely if you're singing from a deficit not the best idea so I know for me I tend to be very free-flowing maybe there's a couple things I'll say again again but they tend to get cycled out pretty quickly because I'm always just kind of thinking a new fun shit that I want to say in general whether or not that's in my seminar or day day life or whatever it is right other people can have more structure depends on the individual so you want to ask yourself what type of individual are you what type of Swan are you that Bartlett people what type of individual are you what do you resonate with and what is true enjoyment for you what is authentic for you for example there's ways that I like to handle girls sexually like making them squirt or ways that I fuck them that actually is pretty can't okay so a lot of my sex game is pretty can because I'm so fucking good at certain things I like it I like to see the reaction of it but then of course a lot of the way that I fuck is completely out of control and fucking insane and just blows the girls brains out so it depends on on how you're doing it again if you're making girls squirt you could argue that you're doing that to compensate for something but you could also just argue that you're doing because you love to see her enjoying herself so you love it cuz she enjoys it if Jeff for Julian airing these boys that use a bit more structure say they're saying because they just enjoy doing it they enjoy the enjoy the effect is having that's fine but again that's a different mentality from not knowing how to free flow because anybody with a Jeff or any of these dudes who have ever used structure you have to also keep in mind they've done plenty of pickup without it so it's like the icing on the cake it's not the cake itself right it's like it's not it's a spice on the steak it's not the steak but for a lot of dudes it is very literally um you know they think that that's what pickup is and it's not so just different ways of looking at it and hope you got some good value out of it so in a way this is a Jeffie going off to meet my idol Harry Potter and Harry Potter land and I hope you enjoyed this and we'll see you next time turn it down for one patient and patient and patient and favor confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion and freeze,2dbiDtnnnn0
I will personally never have the complete vibe of a natural why is that I'll never look like a complete natural because I have that first two decades plus of bad reference experiences so a true natural if you want to get technical probably has been you know getting laid since he's like 11 or something like that we don't even laugh at anybody here ever get laid in you're 11 no okay haha I guess that make sense why you guys were this evil Stifler right this is a big total example of that okay cuz what he does he told me a story once he's like yeah when I was in freshman year high school I decided to join the football team because I'd be like oh you know they get girls so he joined the football team which a couple practices and he's 13 years old he already had a little little girlfriends he fingerbang shit right and so uh he's at the practice one day and one of his little girlfriends runs up to the field like a third fence and she's like hey James he's like oh hey what's up she's like what's what's going on it's like I joined the football team she's like oh that's cool anyway yeah me and Wendy and so on so we're going to her hot tub do you want to come with he's like oh no I got the practice she's like so go okay bye you say what'd he do he took the path and shit off threw it down and then he's been doing that shit for 20 years literally this guy so we'll never be like that cuz look I'd say personally when I'm doing what I'm doing physical escalation if I look at myself compared to say 90% of the population plus 90% pretty fucking smooth with it right it'll be smooth won't even be able to tell it's happening I'll be completely integrated into the vibe integrate into the texture of the conversation totally natural but when I saw myself on video next to evil stipler I almost look like stiff and roboticle okay and he looks like like some kind of National Geographic special like that name like full length but one time I hope we're having you're having dinner or something and at this bar and I opened this girl we both search and arrive so I go I just moved here I live next door okay let's let's check let's go smoke some dope but whatever right so we go next door and as soon as we get into this woman's house as soon as the door closes it's like oh he's like up honor my casa don't play your topic like I'm on whoa so again we'll never I doubt I'll ever be like that pretty much like breathing escalating dreams like yeah it's pensive it's so natural and says through that lost a transfer they tend to accept it because they don't get any awkwardness or weirdness or apprehension or anything coming off it's just like this is how it is right yeah the best example I think of this would be like child movie stars where you see some guy that's like been like like the little prince since he's a kid and he's had people fawning on him for a long time for better for worse by the way because someone can be like it can kind of fuck them up cuz they're two entitled but they've never had bad reference experiences so me like I have like a lot of bad reference experiences you know just had a lot of bad reps experiences so there's gonna always be like that last little bit of gap between yourself in a natural but here's what's also kind of cool by the way a natural a lot of time they they have a lot of self delusion that keeps them like quote-unquote in state whereas guys like us if we kind of lose our frame we know how to sort of kick start it back where's a lot of naturals if they get into a bad frame they just go home like little butthurt little babies I've seen that a lot of my a lot of my natural buddies like they get pissed off and there's like me it's like they just take their ball and go home you know yeah yeah yeah because because they don't understand how to re Kickstarter where's guys like us it's like we know how to like you know boom you know like we kick started because we had to learn how to do it um but anyway uh-oh as his mother side note I often wonder but you could tell me your opinion on this is kind of tangent is it also possible that he's so natural because he does like a lot of MDMA and he just festivals because it note was seriously because that night that I went to like one of those druggie parties one night okay and I was like weirding girls the fuck out and that girl back there he's like done a bit of partying in her life she was telling me that like she says like that the way that like if somebody's on MDMA the way that I approach would be like somebody who come up to me being like hey back yeah yeah like that and even if I like my version of even chill but to somebody on MDMA like like I could even just call me like hey like what's up how's it going to do but to somebody like on drugs you know that would be dirt yeah yeah because so she said that like we had like if someone's like on MDMA you have to go up in yet like I don't know about this chick I'm just like I'm just like just like above my pay grade okay I don't really know a lot about this I just thought was interesting so she's like she's like look if cuz we're it because me her we're at a party so she's like look just go up to the girl just beat just be like floaty you know and that isn't allowing evil sellers like right so it's like floaties right so meet her like go up so stunning like fucking 19 year old girl and we're over and like I just like imitated what she told me so I was just like I'm like I'm on MDMA yeah you know right sound like so like I'm like yeah right now she's got that vibe right naturally cuz she's like super chill so so I'm just like yeah cool you know and then we were all just like yeah right I've been all of a sudden it was just like right like this and it was all created my students are just like looking at this like a little mini orgy and the students are just like holy shit this is awesome no but but anyway so like I've always wondered if like maybe I'd be a better pickup artist if I just started like taking massive amounts of drugs like going to Burning Man and I just like went around like cuz think of the evil Jimmy he's probably meant months of his life just like walking around just like just like yeah like you know I said I mean that's what he looks like that's how what he does yeah he just like like this you know mm-hm ever since  remember remember what it's like yeah well you know I think that lolly fit inside you know what it will do it will make you supremely empathetic it will make you very very emotionally acute it's like you're Ulysses you will be able to tell her you'll be able to tell exactly where what everyone else is feeling you know like you'll be able to text subtle little shifts in the nuance of the tone and stuff like that not so but the problem is at least for me personally my experience it turns me to like sensitive code so like yeah girl when I get back to the place I'm like you know and then the next morning come on man then I was like all nice I'm like mad that I was nice what I like about Jeff too is like like most most like normal people we just remember the night is like they got like really fucked up in a super fun but just like no I'm not accepting that was super fun fun got shit I didn't get laid no like in the day way if if the student is a complete loss us and nothing will save him you give him the pickup cocktail which is steroids ecstasy entire impressive the ecstasy he'll love everybody and he has water on the human haha never actually administer this cocktail but absolute but now congratulations Jeff now someone in this haha and now this guy the room is like new to pick up he's like what the fuck is this pick up shit like this shit is so cool it's like this is a way better than I ever imagined to be a day okay sir I think you should totally put up this I think gestured do you guys think gesture put this as his video for the week he should video of evil like a Segway evil Stifler he's he he does have this new moves quite spastic usually oh he's like have you ruined this for me like you ruined hand of God by telling these faggots about it he is so pissed his idea he's convinced and he came up with hand of God kind of good actually and then he's like don't tell anyone and I told everyone I guess we can just do it just for the guys in this room not released second okay to show you really meant he caught it so dumb he calls it the Pogo huh okay so stand over there he does this yes do I know you a guy there so he's talking to a guy you're the guy to go I know like and the guy does any sense of birth effect the further away you do it from the better  God is not a response so like weird funny like the Pogo is like amazing opener he's like have we met you see he doesn't meet like a tent like like in his mind since it's like a shit technique it works because he has a 100% believe huh when I say when I seen him out by the way the way he approaches girls like you just kind of go up anything like this right then you just grab her arm and he'd be like hey my bad right any girls are loving it they're like hey what that is like yeah fucking a burly who seems pretty sharp as well like my people think he's just like his dumb ass I got gay pretty quick witted shit as well like you guys were a minotaur like that's not the guy this one for like be small right he's also extremely witty right so you know there's a bit more to it than things might appear on the surface but yeah where do you say when he does the Pogo is using his normal voice or like a weird like cartoony voice he's very congruent wait he has the same voice Saeki hey hey man hey man yeah so what's going on man get like you just talks like that all the time and well it's funny like when you watch you're always weird he's like I was priming his physiology to approach it was all he's never like you'll never see that dude like like standing around like still his arms folded looking around and then about to punch somebody cuts up said I can do down purpose or is it just it's just how we act and that natural send to be very in their own reality they're kind of just doing what they're doing imagine that the girls here you're here you got your space she's got her space and this is like conceptual and physical and then there's that space between what a lotta guys will do is they'll they'll sit back and those be like a loop like James Bond or some shit and I expected us to come to them that will never happen okay that will never happen except in rare instances if the chicks like a cougar crap I'm kind of like drugged psycho or something then it might happen but generally not a girag psycho yeah deranged maniac which you know havin some time to time and not enough to be like seriously consider that is you know using it as your technique okay other guys will like jump across to the girl like come on come on come on come on come on right really what you want to do is just kind of put yourself into that middle space and like allow her to meet you in the middle right so holding tension wait grounded on the heels you're in your own reality and the most important thing where it's coming from eternally is this is it come from a like again feeling your body while you're talking is it comes from a that place of I hope that she stays and keeps talking to me I hope it's hope it works if I say this will she like it do you think it's cool what if I say this do you think I'm cool will you please stay and keep talking to me versus just no filter vomiting whatever the fuck you think is funny okay so again I have this like in my hot seat I did this this video where I open the girl by saying what do I say uh excuse me I was wondering if you noticed how ridiculously fucking cool I look like yeah I did I'm good good so anyway I did it and I just moving on right then I have another video where it's my first approach of the night like you guys heard a 30-second game okay that's where my wings and I will count each other down and for anyone on bootcamp this applies to you as well we'll start counting you down 30 29 28 to get to zero and you haven't approached oh we punch you in the in the arm as hard as possible crazy leverage now we punch each other in the gut turn at home as far as possible we don't get sued with the client so we give you a little house punch and yarn but but in any case so they start counting me downs first approach the night not warmed up at all 30:29 with oh shit and now I'm on the spot and so I'm like what do I say I need to say something cool okay that thing about how ridiculously cool I look that was funny before hey excuse me I was wondering if you guys had noticed how ridiculously fucking cool I look to hear the difference exact same words once coming from place of life I saw myself in a mirror something like god damn with shit at the ton I'm fucking shit excuse me how was honor your cure huh right and then the second one I'm like Oh need to be cool leave excuse me I was wondering if you noticed our Dixie fuck you cool a look and they're like fuck off okay exact same words coming from different places in turn elite now in terms are you like asking a question about kind of want to revisit that where evil Stifler's like is he doing that as a technique it's funny cuz this guy he has no conception of Tex like at all he doesn't have a conception the internet yeah he calls it boo do in fact we went out together we were the other night and we pulled these girls and pulled out the hottest girl from the club is pretty awesome he's text me and I say see I'm so proud of you you went on the real world and cat lady you didn't use that voodoo of yours the Internet that's it he calls the Internet voodoo okay but the thing is such an extent like he can't explain what he does in fact he comes along on boot camp just like hang out you know a lot of the time kind of guest and I won't even allow him to speak because he'll say stupid shit that makes no sense why didn't you see the students becoming quite confused like it like the other tape he goes I guess he's like well you know what you need to do I've got a act like a black guy yeah and if I just plow it on your hubby enough and then and they're like why doesn't evil snicker become an instructor I was like you know I know what the instructor like like free okay imagine free tour evil Stifler all right guys and then you see like a girl walk by out there you doing that's why here we would never hire him the fandom fucking program at the first anyway ah Debbie what do you mean Sanjay yeah actually um my lawyers little brother mm-hmm is his two natural guys the other the other give us if there is the younger brother he's fucked like eight nine hundred girls the older brother is only fuck like 400 but he's more like Captain America like he's a success he's like rich she's fucking like he only dates like dime piece is evil Stifler is a little more a little less discriminating say he's rolling around with like some more door creatures or you that but again he doesn't have that stringent Ito standards and all this but um see I'm good friends with the with the the lawyer one right I'm good friends with the one who's like successful and I'm friends of both of them right and then jest friends Bolden but he's he's closer with evil sniffler right so the original Stifler was the one we met right then we met his little brother who's a lot like him he's actually just like I'm evil but he's evil so this is the evil little brother right so now any any friend of my friends like you know there's a by default a friend of mine to whatever degree right so I always try to like bond with evil Stiffler like I really try it's like really difficult it's like I tried to talk to Mike Aniston at all yeah no idea this guy's saying dog yeah okay cat tell me your life yeah that's like it yeah cuz like I'll be talking to mom I'm like I'm like it was sobbing he's like he's like yeah what am i right no Mike yeah you don't like talk to him I can't handstand him he's like oh yeah you know right I'm like and I'm like oh yeah you know I can't this is what's funny about that dude like one of the things for a success you just incessantly wants to party that's it here's what's a party he just wants to go party all the time that's all he wants to do date night he's like he's like dammit he's a massage therapist so he's like guys come on yo let's go party no I got to go rub a hairy old man back but I'll meet you out after he's like super sad like he's just like we go to some party and we live like all right I'm going who's like no let's go to this party at like he just he's like a tank this has never stops ass motherfucker but I think again that's kind of what makes him good he just wants have fun all the time you know and that's what really sort of clicks with the girls because I see so many somebody pick up guys especially pick new pick up guys and what are pick up guys thinking in the club have to do I highly doubt they're trying on getting away most of them are thinking about getting laid most of her thinking about like trying to piss their pants like they're thinking of this idea of getting laid okay in fact that's a big thing I had to shit the other night last weekend we're in Seattle and I see the student and he's on the dance floor with this girl he's like doing the fucking Lambada or some shit like he's like like grinding her like what the fun like oh shit I'm like wow this about to go down all of a sudden the girl just kind of like hops up and then just walks away from him and I'm like yo what the fuck what what is this what happened said I don't know I was dancing with her I thought it was going good but then she walked away and I knew immediately what what it was he had no actual sexual intent he was merely going through the motions of what he thought sexual interaction should look like you know I mean he did have a boner okay that's why I would say boner is not Kino okay you guys look like it's just I executed the Kino okay well according to law state transfer you want to put yourself in the state you want the girl to be in and Tim used to call this one intense we now call it party dawn okay party you're like feeling awesome so she'll feel awesome around you and then dawn so she will be feeling dong okay she would be like if I get along with this guy he's gonna fuck right so this guy's fun and he's going through these motions he's like emulating a guy who's actually sexual but the thing is she knows if she goes home this guy he's not taking his dick out or he's gonna be a shitty lay right so she just fucks off so I told the student this he's like it's funny cuz he's like he's like let me go back because we're about to bounce the other clown my girl right let's get out of here he's like no please Jeff just give me five minutes to go fix this and I'm like I'll allow it so instead he goes in okay and sure enough five minutes later dude it was like it was like a movie or something like this I would see it in my mind he probably didn't actually happen straight but in my mind I saw like this all of a sudden he kicks the door of the club open and he's got two pigs like in his arms like some fucking like Fabio from a romance novel any like Marx is out who those are in a cabin bails off Mike holy shit I'm like he had finally had enough for me I think that bootcamp is for many guys it's it's pushing them through a lot a lot of approaches that they might not typically do on their own and what that does is they get this aggregate of bad feedback because what makes guys I mean dude we can we can yell at some guys who were blue in the fucking face but until he's experiencing himself he's not going to internalize whatever lesson that is I mean shit we know that more than ain't like yelling and some guy just hitting this fog of where they're saying yes they're saying yes yes yes but they're you know they're not it's not penetrating the fog they don't understand it so what's actually to get them in fact to get that emotional leverage is seeing a lot of bad feedback in a very short period of time in this specific instance what his block was this okay and we always say this when guys when you go up to a girl you want two things number one you want to avoid getting rejected number two you want to you want her to become attracted and whichever one you want more that's the one that's going to manifest so for a lot of newbies they theoretically wants to get laid but in reality they just want to find a way to do it without looking stupid or getting bad feedback or rejected so what do they do they hedge the bets they don't go in hard they communicate is a friend to a friend hi how are you what's your name what do you do how about this weather do you like it I like it here look I like cars like what do you do Sherpa daddy to do right and they have this polite conversation and 9 times out of 10 fuck that 98 times out 100 what they're gonna get is 10 5 to 10 minutes of polite conversation followed by a hearty handshake and the phrase it was nice to meet you and maybe a little patronizing dog pat on the arm and you guys know what this means when they do that you know you know what this is such a girl sign language work I will never have sex with you in your entire life little guy there you go little guy go play right now go play okay you know said so but the thing is I mean obviously it's a bit of a joke but but really like it's like they just get nice to meet you nice to meet you nice to meet you nice to you and for that guy he's had enough finally he got a preponderance of so many nice to meet use that something snapped the the scales tipped and he finally got the emotional leverage required to go and take his dick out figuratively okay so so you know for many guys that's what that's what that is it's like just again hitting that that shift that the mental shift where no more nice to meet you I'm going to be mad woman from now on at the end by the way that's really cool too because when we say go out a lot it's interesting because you're you're getting reference experiences and you're building social calibration but you're also building frustration which is a good thing can you see that for example I this one video in hasi where I'm on a girl that a lot of guys say she's a 10 active she's actually not a tenant in my view of it but um a lot a lot of guys will say she's attends like one of the hottest girls in hössi and I'm just a fucking dick you know like she like she's even like offering number I'm like no you know right and she's like I'll give you my number I'm like no no I turn my back on her and like you can even see me smiling because I'm like right this right she's like no no you know right it's like no I'm staying at the shore Club you know right like she's you know and um and some guys that actually pretty experienced we're watching this and they were like dude you you're really playing to win you know and I'm like well yeah the reason I'm playing to win is because I've had enough experiences through going out where I am on that dime piece and she gives me it like you know come like the polite number and I didn't kind of hardball it hard enough you know and she just likes me so that accumulation of flakes and frustration you get to a point where you're like fuck this shit no no you know again you see what works you don't see how you'd like things to work you see what actually works and you get this pro I mean because again women will just brutally punished bad game like yeah all compunction about it whatsoever they're not a charity they're not just sex charity they're not there to be let me make this guy feel good again water most pickup guys thinking in the club they're thinking what's my angle of approach what's the opener where's my value relative to hers right now what is the next move what did you two do did to their minds racing without his logical information what a girl sitting in the fucking Club okay you know the girls are they in the club that's literally what the second thinking it's just just cascade of positive emotions okay now it's funny because a couple of years ago when I should came up with this interpretation of the female thought process in the club I told my girlfriend at the time and she was like but Jeff isn't that what you think in the club yeah and it pretty much is exam lightly different stuff like yeah okay Pippen it shit look whoa what's up down yeah it's just like this idiot it's like these retarded children almost you'll see us in there will be like doing stupid dances like okay you will never fuck you're catching the club like this like you know scanning in fact we even play a game like when I'm at home you know simpler we'll play this game call five and rather than if we can't think of anything to say in the club and like there's you know there's no girls want approach at that moment while she just have a fake conversation with each other as opposed to standing there value skating I'll be like yo dude man I went down there the other day to the weasels nest and I saw Obama and he took me to building Joel's concert and in here been a good job yeah yeah yeah and so it's fucking too sick they had this mole a sauce and they brought him in with Big Bird and they came down from a fucking thing and you know how big birdie is like he's fucking it's all fucking trying to cool shit and do five five man yeah right and so this is the spouting gibberish at each other and so this does two things number one anyone watching us what rather than seeing a couple nerds value scanning will see like we're having this amazing enthusiastic conversation but the funny part is this it actually makes you feel as though you're having an amazing in tears he has to conversate okay so that when they go the girls walk by you can see okay what side this just rip them right into that energy rather than okay let me put on the fun energy now to go approach and then once the girl like leaves then wah-wah-wah like back to back here like a little a little thinking man self why right I'll see that many times of students I'll be like okay put yourself in the state you want them to be in before you go up so that means have fun so don't be like will be like do the party and then the store will be like okay go approach the girls he's like hey girls me anything and he comes back to us and we're like dude fucking fine because Vegas like Jeff I'm like huh oh hey dude yeah this do smooth like you know like take move mom but it's like shit I know you're faking I can tell I'm at your fucking thinking you're faking having a good time you know you got to call him out on that cuz again it's like when the girls leave with us it's not like we're like there to there we ripped the girls in remember crap they leave we're like haha that shit man those fucking Larry it's like the movie keeps going cuz get it our movies our movie not the girls yeah keeps I'm not trying to get in their movie yeah you want to grab instance woman uh what time is it sleep 9:30 I think we should okay yeah yeah fuck it just gonna grab could you guys give Jeff a hand by the way,2wPTiJKg1sM
yo yo what up it's your extensible boy Jeffy I'm here today in Chicago Illinois and today we're going to talk to you about is how to actually get girls to chase you now this is one of the biggest issues I see among novice students of the game is they look like little puppy dogs when they're out interacting little puppy dogs that have never had a bone and you're throwing the bone across this tile floor and they're furiously scrambling across the tile floor to get their first bone that is the sort of vibe that I get when I see these as interacting with the women and it never gets to the point where the girls are actually participating in the interaction to the extent where it looks like they actually want the guy so what I want to teach you today is how to flip that script so to speak and actually stop being this overeager little puppy dog who's chasing chasing chasing and how to actually get them to chase you  so the first tip to actually getting them to chase you it's quite simple it stopped being so damn agreeable now what does this mean in practice it means basically you got to establish certain boundaries for yourself that you won't let other people cross so what's a very very common one that I see all the time on the club the girls would go up to a random guy and they'll say take our picture take our picture or they'll be talking to actually talking to the guy and they'll be like out of the blue hey will you take our picture and the guy will almost immediately be like oh yeah of course of course because he thinks like if I'm nice to them they'll like me back right not necessarily because here's the thing now you're essentially picture boy you have now become picture boy so when they ask me typically I'll politely decline I'll demurrer in a number of ways sometimes I'll be like look I'm not the guy you want to take these pictures I'm actually quite terrible at photography I don't think that I'm your man honestly I really don't think I'm your man I've know Ansel Adams over here and if they insist then what I'll do is I'll just take it in an extremely incompetent manner like for example I'll take the picture I'll take their phone and I'll cover the lens with my finger so it's just this like picture of a finger and like half of their head or I'll like cut them out of the frame we'll do this repeatedly until there's like enough clearly you're incompetent and then they have someone else do it now I'm not doing this to be like some jerk what's another example if they ask you to buy them a drink that's kind of the classic one buy me a drink here's the thing 99 times out of 100 if you buy them the drink they're simply going to leave immediately thereafter and this is true even in cases where they liked you before they actually liked you but then they asked you to buy them the drink and then once you did you're immediately slotted into the regular guy category and this is something that I've talked about before you can actually see the air gets sucked out of the interaction like a like an airlock and all of a sudden their demeanor totally changes towards you their opinion of you totally changes and it is done now like I said the one time out of 100 it might be actually a good idea to buy them to drink like I had one time I was speaking with a woman and it was going very well we had kissed and so forth and it you know her friends loved me etc etc like all the markers were there and she said I think you should buy me a drink and I was like uh this is not the right idea this is something that always results in a terrible outcome when I when I've done this almost every other time in the past but I had some weird inkling that maybe this was just some kind of like test on her part that every guy had to buy her a drink in order for her to leave like Oh some parameter that she had set up in her life in her mind in order for her to go with the guy the guy had to buy her a drink so I sensed this and I asked her I was like very tentative I'm like do you think it's a good idea if I buy you a drink and she's like yes I think it's a good idea if you buy me the drink and then I bought the drinks like okay let's go but again that's one time out of a hundred so again that rule the exception to that rule is so rare that it may as well not even exist it's negligible so the same rule applies the same idea applies to your personal boundaries once in a great great while you might want to step outside of those as it's like a gesture or something of that nature or if you're just feeling altruistic or whatever the case may be but the vast vast majority of the time you're just gonna shoot yourself in the foot with that so don't do it establish boundaries and stick to them if they're like come over here bring all your stuff over here and you know asking you to move or make yourself uncomfortable in some way that's violation of your personal batteries don't do it and again you don't beat you don't wanna be angry about it that's a big thing two guys they learn about this stuff and then they get the pendulum swings in the complete opposite direction and now all of a sudden they're like this angry jerk they're like no no I'm gonna I'm never gonna do anything anyone ever asks of me I've become Oscar the Grouch I live in a trash can now with I think I was loved about Oscar the Grouch he lived in a trash can but it was apparently it had infinite space down below and he lived with like an elephant for a roommate anyway a little uh Sesame Street side tangent there let's say that you do stumble upon that one time out of a hundred that you think it's a good idea to maybe kind of step outside the boundaries own and be a little philanthropic if you will one thing to bear in mind is if you do go ahead with their request you know to comply with whatever they're saying you put conditions on it so one thing that I used to do back in the day when the girl would ask me to buy them a drink I would say you know I really don't do that everyone will buy girls drinks it's not kind of it's not really my style but I will buy you one after you kiss me if you're a good kisser are you a good kisser on a scale of one to ten how good are you they'd be like eleven I'll be like prove it and then they'd kiss me and then I'd buy them the drink another example is on the flip side when you're asking for compliance from meth so I would say for example if I was gonna pull back to my house I would say well you can come out to my house we we can grab a nightcap but you can only say 15 minutes like the classic Falls time constraint I got to wake up in the morning I got a lot of stuff to do you could only save 15 minutes or you could only say if my dog likes you or you can only come in the van if you promise not to get it dirty inside the van which a lot of people say well isn't the van dirty no the van is cleaner than your house is most likely okay so FYI a lot of people who get in the van they'll be like oh man I'd hate to see this van under a blacklight and I actually got that so frequently that I purchased a small black light and when they say this I now take the black light on I shine it around and there's no stains or fluids of any sort anywhere and then I'll shine it like on the person and it almost invariably they'll have some kind of like little food stain or something and it starts glowing under the black light I'm like you're the one that's bringing semen in here okay get the fuck out get out of my van you're making it filthy in here so anyway if you're asking for compliance or if they're asking for compliance from you and you want to go along with it one thing you can do is put conditions on it so now this third one is very very simple but very very powerful and it's allow pauses to exist in the conversation so many times when I'm out on the bootcamp I see the clients and they're just desperate to fill in any sort of silent space right like if the girl stops so I can they're like blah blah blah and they half they they just have to talk because they're uncomfortable with that silence existing so this is actually an interesting tip just in general charisma is when a person says something to you before you even respond to look them in the eye and allow the pause to exist for a couple seconds this will give them the impression number one that you're present with them which is again the foundational aspect of all charisma while charismatic behavior and number two it'll get really given the impression that you're processing what they said to you before you respond you're not just one of these people that's sitting there waiting for your turn to speak like listening just waiting for your turn to speak so just allowing pauses to exist and letting them fill in the gap or pausing after they say something you before you respond it's a great way to stop putting forth this aura of chasing after them and sort of get them more invested where they get to the point where they're actually chasing you now another funny little thing you can do is kind of create a sort of antagonistic flirtation vibe and just one quick little example of this where it's kind of like you know you're kind of butting heads a little bit and it's kind of a fun way to inject a little bit of a little bit of tension into the interaction and one thing that I'll do is I'll do an opener when they're walking by if they like glanced at me and they look me in the eye I'll be like don't fucking look at me like don't look at me like avert your gaze what are you doing why are you seeing this way what does she not understand about this look away go away go away now if done correctly what this will typically do is this will make them come up to you and kind of get in your face on what what what so it's again it's sort of this sort of like antagonistic flirtation vibe and it can be kind of fun and add sort of a plot line to the interaction now one thing I would caution though is when you do this you want to transition off of the antagonistic vibe very very quickly you know relatively quickly before it becomes like not this fake antagonist advice but a genuine antagonistic vibe which can go south you know of course you know it's a thin line between love and hate as they say which is sort of the foundation of this little tactic but you don't want to take it too far either so the next tip for getting them to actually chase you it's an old classic from the heyday from the nascent days of the community as it were and this is doing little push polls so what's the classic push Paul you and I wouldn't get along I can tell right now Reid you and I would not get along we're just too similar you know we just argue all the time and then we'd have freaky makeup sex you know I'm just not ready for these volatile relationships right now or maybe I am what are you doing to me what are you doing to me girl I'm so confused right so I got a jokey little push Paul like mate like will we or won't we I'm not sure if I've liked you or I'm not sure if I don't there's something about you I either love it or hate it or maybe both things of that nature now another type a little kind of push that you can do that's even more subtle is if you're talking to her and she kind of doesn't give a hundred percent like compliance to what you're saying or she sort of doesn't like react super great to something you said you can say to her like oh hey sorry I you know I don't want to like ruin your night here do you want me to leave like literally something as simple as that a tiny little push like oh hey yeah I didn't want to sorry I don't want to like ruin your night here do you want me to leave now if they like you at all what they'll typically say is they'll be like no it's okay we'll tell you if we want you to leave so what you're doing with this is you're sort of highlighting and underlining how little you actually care about the outcome because again the little puppy dog guy the newer guy who is very very eager to please and he was chasing the girl he wouldn't say something like that now that's obviously an example of a very benign sort of simple push I've done even crazier pushes in the past I remember I was in New Orleans for Mardi Gras once on a boot camp and it was nearing the end of the night and I had this I was with this girl and it was like we were out front we were kissing it stuff and it was time to go and it look you're nearing closing time and so I said all right let's get out of here it's like oh no I can't leave my friends and I looked at my watch I was like if she doesn't come with me I need to get back in there and find somebody who will be more you know likely to want to go with me who will actually want to go with me so I said to her I said look tell your friends that you're gonna go or I'll just go call another girl and she goes oh Paul another girl huh you mean you mean like you pulled me and I said to her I look at her it's deadpan like yes exactly like that and she stands there sort of indignant for a second she's like fine I'll tell him to go and internally I'm like I can't believe that that actually worked of course externally I'm trying to play it cool Mike yeah all right let's go but internally I'm like wow that was quite a Hail Mary but the thing was at that point if she didn't go it was gonna be a you know it was a now-or-never so I figured I may as well I attempt that Hail Mary give that push to try to get her off the fence and in that instance it worked of course this is gonna work every single time but it can be a valuable tool so to speak in your toolbox so this next little tip is actually one that I got from a buddy of mine who goes by daddy J quote-unquote and this is a very very simple one as well and it's just using the word actually right now you might say well that sounds kind of weird just say the word actually in what context well for example I'll say to her you know what I'll look at her and I think you know what you're actually cool it's like what like as though before you didn't think they were cool and they have somehow won you over like you know what wow you're actually smart things like that just to kind of to kind of give that impression that your weren't totally sold on them up until that point again very very simple little tip and be quite effective in conveying this attitude that you don't really care about the outcome you're not super eager and again that's what it takes to set the dynamic to get hurt so to meet you in the middle so to speak where it's more of a it's more of a concerted effort like she's on board with going with you as opposed to you just like you push push push push push and then she relented which in my opinion is a much more preferable outcome right the vibe of it just feels a lot better as opposed to like you were this little guy that finagled her to go with you know she's an active participant in the interaction and she wants it just as much as you do and that's how it's got to be now the last little tip that I got for you it's another very simple one but it's actually not so simple and it's this never qualify yourself in any way now what do I mean by that it means you're not you're unapologetic for how you are for your behavior for your demeanor for your personality for your worldview and you're not going to alter that in order to attempt to pander to someone else's likes needs or even desires necessarily especially something that you just met two minutes ago so what does this mean well for example I often dress in like a bit of a garish manner when I'm out you know I'll wear like a weird headband or something or like some weird bling-bling and oftentimes girls will say to me orders people in general be like what is this nonsense what is this why are you wearing this headband now one way that all approaches is all just do kind of like a like a jokey sort of off like an offhanded like obviously sarcastic kind of jokey response to that like for the headband I'll be like oh I'm actually an extreme athlete and I wear this in order to keep the sweat out of my eyes because at any moment I can launch it to an extreme athletic endeavor and the stuff I'm doing it's like wow it's like parkour and shit and like at any moment I can just launch into that like a parkour move and a moment's inattention could result in a catastrophic injury so you got to be very very circumspect about every little thing and that's what this headband does now if I'm feeling less verbose I'll be like this is not a headband this is a cape for my brain like what and then just change the subject like no apologies no further explanation now somebody get someone who's just kind of like mean and they're kind of like ragging on you and like just constantly making fun of you in which case I'll leave it self deprecated a little bit and I'll be like wow you guys are like the mean cool kids used to make fun of me in high school thanks a lot it's like three years of therapy down the drain I guess I'm just gonna go home and cry myself to sleep listening to Lionel Richie staring at a candle putting cigarettes out of my penis like I do every night my entire penis it looks like one big cigarette burn it's like Freddy Krueger's penis I always like Freddy Krueger he's my favorite horror villain you know from Nightmare on Elm Street because all the other horror villains like Michael Myers Jason they wouldn't say anything they were just kind of like chase you silently but Freddy he had like quips he'd make little jokes he'd be like time to die bitch alright so I was like and again with that just changing the subject off of it leading the conversation off of it but again never qualifying myself sometimes even going so far as to self deprecated just to show again that I'm not super eager to have it work I don't absolutely need it to work I'm just enjoying myself in the environment I'd like it to but if it doesn't I'm very very comfortable my own skin as well so the point of all these and the underpinning of them that makes them so effective is the fact that with the stuff you're not playing the game that she's accustomed to you're not one of these guys like every other guy that's coming up to her like come on come on do you like me do you like me do you like me and it actually allows for a more authentic interaction because once you've put this stuff aside now you could actually be real and you just put yourself in that middle space you're not selling yourself you're marketing yourself which means you're putting your best foot forward you're showing your personality you're being expressive and you're giving them that spit you're not crowding them you're giving them that space to meet you in the middle and that is when they will start chasing you and it's a phenomenal feeling let me assure you so anyway there's been Jeffy telling you to get out there and make the myths  you [Music],39yZGhaJay8
hey hey this your boy Jeffy I'm coming at you today from San Francisco California here in my little den of iniquity and I'm certain as you begin to watch this video the first thing that catches your eye is this rather striking shirt that I have on and this is of course one of the latest releases from the heart of beast beast mode v-neck line this one's actually called jolt on a day-to-day basis this is probably the beast mode shirt that I actually wear out the most it's my poor my personal favourites and with jolt you're getting a jolt of reality it's going to inspire you to refuse the socially conditioned narrative engage beast mode so yeah so having said all that today I'd like to take a look at one of the more common issues that plagues guys who are just beginning to get their feet wet in the world of cold approach pickup and it's a little something that I like to call premature ejaculation don't worry it happens to everyone from time to time so this is what happens when you approach a woman you get a good initial reaction and you eject before it can go bad so in a sense it's sort of like a delayed reaction approach anxiety and this is something that I see all the time on boot camp I'll send the student into the set it seems to be going fine and just as I'm getting ready to rock up on the group to wing him he'll turn on his heels and March straight back to me for no apparent reason and I'm like yo what what's going on now don't get me wrong this is something that I can relate to personally is I've you know something I used to do myself and sometimes it's easy to forget that instructors had to learn this stuff from the ground up as well as none of us in rst were really so-called Naturals but of course the difference is that back then there were not many if any professional-grade resources we kind of had to just hunt in the dark just in order to suss out these principles but that's neither here nor there back to the main point premature ejaculation why do we do it are we so desperate to maintain the good emotions of validation that we got from the girls initial decent reaction that we would sacrifice potential sex just to make sure that we'll stay in the good mood well many times the answer is yes and here's why psychologically every single one of us has learned to cope with our life as social beings by creating a certain self-image for ourselves and this of course begins an adolescence as you know teenagers will gravitate towards certain cliques maybe they become goth or preppy or get really into a band or a sports team and this is all of course a natural part of the process of discovering one's identity and as you mature into adulthood well your identity develops further and it crystallizes and it typically becomes a lot more sophisticated than it was when you were younger however it is still a coping mechanism that allows us to get by psychologically ultimately it's no better than the simplistic teen identity it's just further developed so having said that let's go a bit deeper now there's something that I've said in the past and it's this every guy on the planet is basically convinced that he knows how to do two things how to fight and how to bang girls regardless of all evidence to the contrary even the scrawniest pencil-necked software engineer will typically believe that when it comes right down to it he can whoop somebody's ass and if you really wanted to he could go up to a girl in the bar and pick her up see you know nobody likes to think of themselves as quote bad with women because we need to feel desirable as a fundamental part of our self-identity you know if you feel like you're sexually unattractive to the opposite sex well this of course implies a whole host of terrible things by yourself such as bad genetics shit personality poor social intelligence poor upbringing etc and this is why if you tell guys that you study seduction they tend to have very strong negative reactions to it they might ridicule you or even actively hate on you there's just this strong knee-jerk rejection of the very concept of formally studying this area and this is because the very active implying that someone might need help attracting the opposite sex is to imply many many bad things about them and of course this is why you'll see guys who cool to talk about almost anything all right guys who are perfectly cool guys when it comes to basically any other topic than this simply cannot take it when you say you know hey man check this rst stuff out so now let's take it a bit further the biggest problem with so called state control as it relates to approach anxiety is that if you take the time to really think about it your fear is extremely illogical fear exists as a mechanism to prevent us from getting hurt yet ironically our fear of approaching women actually hurts us while approaching them in fact helps us now you can be acutely aware of this on an intellectual level but still feel that fear why bottom line the reason that we feel fear is that it is our way of psychologically preventing ourselves from having a self-image crash your ego simply cannot take the punishment you have a self image that you have carefully cultivated over the years and that sure as hell doesn't include being a guy who women's snub so when you first get into this stuff a big key becoming overcoming so called approach anxiety is the realization that it is it is rooted in the threat to your self-image and then in recognition of this phenomenon you have to begin to re-engineer that self-image to not include your desirability to women first off you got to realize that practically no guys including so-called good-looking ones are actually able to go up to random women and pick them up on a consistent basis at least not in the way that we're learning to do here and furthermore in recognition of this reality about the world we can accept that statistically practically nobody is good with women and thus free ourselves to do the mass approaches that are required to learn the skill set and this is the beginning of outcome independence beyond there as you go out and accumulate reference experiences it will become clear that no matter how tight your game gets you are simply never going to get 100% of the girls there's not a single guy in this plan than every girl likes and when you go up you have absolutely no idea who you're approaching you could be approaching a literal crazy person or perhaps a bonafide lesbian there with her girlfriend whom she loves standing right there you have no idea so you're never gonna be able to eliminate that element of randomness and the classic analogy that Tyler has used in the past is that of the archer firing arrows on a field with like this random unpredictable wind that can come from any direction at any time it wouldn't make sense for you to take ownership of the wind fucking up your shots as you simply have no control over it it's unpredictable so over time you would learn to simply take ownership of the things that you have direct control over ie you know your aim the form the release etc so bringing the analogy home and pick up this would mean that you only care about you know whether you approach strong whether you communicate it as a man to a woman as opposed to a friend whether you self-amused as opposed to trying to impress whether you handle your mechanics properly yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda so you have to see things as they are and it's only then that you're going to be able to free yourself from that threats to your self-image as you simply begin to understand that there's in fact no correlation between your self-image and any particular girl's reaction to you now note that I say any particular girl's reaction if they're all reacting poorly across the board well there may be a deeper issue going on and of course that's where things like the boot camp and the hot seat come into play but at the end of the day you realize that they're not rejecting you they're rejecting your approach in reality if you really think about it your self-image should actually become fucked up when you chicken out of approaching or sticking in when things don't go like perfectly right off the bat and that's the real thing to be ashamed of given that there is so little correlation between your so-called desirability and your actual ability to pick up new random women this actually implies that you're stupid okay so with this simple reassessment you can begin to re-engineer your beliefs and then you begin to see that a a fear of approaching can be quite easily dealt with and you can even apply this to other areas of your life and recognize that there are in fact many areas in which we delude ourselves not just this one and begin to strive for a self-awareness that will bring you closer to equilibrium with our environments and in fact the world and the more that we acknowledge where we're deluding ourselves for the souls sake of preserving this false self-image well the more that we can improve ourselves in the real world and not just in our heads and it's important to do this because on a subconscious level we all know that we're lying to ourselves and this can manifest outwardly in our consciousness as things like depression anger etc etc etc so by aspiring to gain more and more self-knowledge we can actually begin to purge ourselves of this bullshit and that is when we begin to emit a charisma that people are irresistible drawn to you ever notice how some people just kind of rub you the wrong way but you can't explain why whereas there are some other guys that everyone just wants to be around well the latter are those guys are the ones who have come closer to this equilibrium with the real world and the one that they perceive in their minds and those are the guys who have the potential to become amazing and pick up because they have ultimate state control there are alternately comfortable themselves and that's going to come through in their interactions with women so the first step is psychologically liberating yourself giving yourself the permission to be comfortable doing Nass approaches in order to learn the skill set and from there it's just a matter of getting the interactions under your belt seeing what works and discarding what doesn't until it all becomes second nature  you,3HIhfC9zo-w
this is your proverbial boy Jeffy here in latest plane Amsterdam and you might be wondering what I'm here for well I'm here for one thing and one thing alone love and by love I mean money and by money I mean desire and by desire I mean mushrooms and by mushrooms I mean something else that isn't related to that so in any case what we're actually going to do is we're going to take a little question and the first question today comes from Nikolai and he asked this what are some top tips when buying a consensual sex van well the main thing what you're going to want to look for are structural integrity and you're going to want to make sure that the Spets the suspension is significant enough to actually take the weight now in my case I got a cargo van a Ford e350 the 400 big-block and this is more than enough to handle a variety of large people in the back in fact I've at one point had 13 men in this vehicle not for a gay orgy but rather for a boot camp which in some ways is like a gay orgy I suppose however without the sex and I remember one time I was up in there I had like myself Tyler my assistants his assistant and then like six boot camp students and there's total 13 guys now granted it was crowded in there like fucking sardines and it smelled quite unpleasant however at a certain point it was interesting because as we're doing like the debrief I noticed in the side mirror there's a man urinating on the vehicle and I'm like yo dude I'm like stop pissing on my car and as I shut the fuck up and I'm like alright boys everyone out of the van and so like 13 men pile out of the van and like surround this guy it's like don't piss on a van you don't know who's inside the van ok and I'm like how would you like it about to piss on you and as I said we're beginning to see a theme here from last week's video of like people getting kissed not but but any case what I would say is this bottom line you don't need a big cargo van if you're going to get something to get something simple get something unobtrusive give something that's not going to draw a lot of attention personally I would go with an astro camper van perhaps a mini van take the back seats out construct a small raised bed in the back maybe a little mini bar in there some fun stuff and voila you've got your own mobile legit now one thing about the van and this is crucial I see a lot of kids they've tried to get bands in the past and what they even saw one case where the kids they got they rented like a cargo van from Hertz and they had nothing in the back like some shitty like blow-up mattress in the back and I was like dude this is the creepiest shit you can conceivably come up with it literally looks like you're going to murder someone you know oh here's this like panel van with nothing inside except some like ratty fucking mattress on the ground like no one's getting in that shit the thing that makes the van so good is it's an extension of the fun right so again when I'm interacting with the girls fun fun fun fun fun the logical world is not intrude it's this kind of ethereal dreamlike state of fun fun fun fun fun fun until the daddy takes the t-bird away and once we get to the van it's simply an extension of that when they get to the band they're not shocked they're not appalled they're they're enthralled they're like a common comment so that I'll hear is oh my god you've got the most awesome fucking shit ever and then they like get right into it because there's crazy lights there's a disco ball there's fun little games there's like a wave machine there's a Donald Trump pinata there's all kinds of fake mustaches costumes a little Pikachu a star thing the lights up the music there's again the little mini bar in there and so it's all an extension of the fun it's like a tree fort when you were a kid so that would be my biggest advice advices if you will to someone looking to get their own van make sure that it's appropriate make sure it's in good running condition that's first and foremost over to go get it checked out by mechanic number to make sure that it's going to be easy for you to park like I said I'm a master of parking and I can park that giant cargo van anywhere but you may have more difficulty you want to be discreet and most importantly of all you want the interior to project fun fun fun fun fun not murder murder murder murder murder all right all right now the second question here somebody asks like Jeff you know I'm really curious how do you incorporate smoking weed into your pickup game I mean I'm an Amsterdam one would assume that you know I'm glazing it up yo Lay's ended up yo well actually not I when I here I I don't smoke at all it's actually quite boring because this is work to me I'm here to work I'm not here to fuck it blades it up like Cheech and motherfucking Chong I do plenty of that at home and in California it's not like a big deal so it's not like well should we but having said that have I game that way before absolutely and I would say this the main thing do you want to bear in mind at least for me personally and again I speak from experience whenever I'm talking to stuff and never pulling stuff out of my ass so is based in real life real world rubber meets the road experience and I've noticed if I smoke weed like Luck's game I'm totally freaked out I'm like inside my head I'm not able to be as effective I stutter and stumble over my words and generally I think it's because if I'm smoking in stay at home and then I go to a different environment now you have to you have to acclimate to that new environment and your mind is like shot and you're acclimated you have to acclimate to that new environment however if I am actually in the club and I'm already in state and then I smoke weed in the club which you know some places you can do that other place you can't but if I do that inside the club then I can slide right into that state and it'll be equally as effective scratch that it's not going to be equally as the fact it'll be probably slightly less effective because I won't be able to keep train of thought I won't be able to pay enough attention it's not even a question of like being paranoid getting anxiety although to be fair I think in some ways smoking weed it makes you less paranoid I would say it makes you better to deal better able to deal with anxiety because since when you smoke weed it actually makes you anxious people who smoke weed a lot are in like this constant state of low-level anxiety so it kind of trains you and conditions you to deal with anxiety aside from that you know honestly you really got to come part mentalize and when I go out to gamble not the game you know I don't drink because I want to be sharp and that's the thing especially like at the end of the night you're going to want to be in a headspace where you're trying to like pick up girls in the street you are the most sober guy there you're at least you're the most together guy there there's got to shit together you know we were around in London last week and it's watching and Leicester Square these these girls coming out of the club you know after closing time around 3:00 and they're just running this gauntlet of drunken fucking idiots who finally worked up the liquid courage to approach and it's very absolutely beautiful of those who's they say hey tell me the perspective hey meanwhile myself and the students were going up our like excuse me a good evening yes allow me to introduce myself and I make sure to enunciate very clearly at that time of night that's why light zone is so to speak so again she can see I'm the most I'm not just one of these drunken idiots that trying to grab at her I'm actually a sober person that's going to set you apart and that's going to actually again make you rise above the hordes of unwashed and moronic idiots that are simply groping at her but again generally look good at compartmentalizing game when you're out to the I'm out the game when I'm out to get wasted I'm out to get wasted and those are two separate and distinct things now granted like I said back in the day I've done some of my best work wasted okay but it's simply not consistent enough however there is something to be said for the idea that game isn't something you do it's something you are so yeah I'd say you know it's important to be well-rounded and I would suggest possibly going out as an experiment you know and just doing it to build familiarity with particle running game while you're in that headspace while you're in that physiology you know it's coursing through your veins um but you know just so you're aware of it of where what to do what it feels like you have a familiarity with it but generally I would say you know not the best you might as well go out like handicap yours it's like essentially handicapping yourself alright now here's the last thing I wanted to talk about and this is an important thing that came up at the London hot seat and I have a student who he actually said to me the hot seat really was eye-opening for him because it showed him that you don't really need to be this guy who has fireworks shooting out of his asshole the whole time and the reason that he arrived at this conclusion was because of something that I said during the hot seat and we had just wrapped up one of the day game videos it's about a thirty minute video and where I sit down with these girls and you know I'm just like rattling off all this shit on my bed being down mommy mommy mom was like to quote Donald Trump Bing bong Bing bong bing bang bang Bing Bing bong bong Bing Bing Bing just like this machine gun of statements of intent this machine gun a funny comment this machine gun of like you know me acting you know like humorous and crazy and charismatic so at the end of this video I asked these as I said how long do you think that that entire set lasted obviously you know the video we just watch the 30 minutes how long do you think the entire set lasted and they're like an hour 45 minutes I'm like no it was two and a half hours and they're like whoa and I like I've even had it I've even had sets that lasted five hours from from day game and stuff like that now there's two reasons that we edit it down number one is because we simple you know time concerns we don't want to be like sitting there watching some two-and-a-half hour video and taking up like a massive proportion of the time we have allotted for hockey but secondly and more importantly a lot of it is just boring there's long stretches in-between those high points where we're just kind of sitting there like [Music] so tell me about your studies you know stuff like that and it's frankly kind of boring now the like I said the reason we don't show that is because for time concerns but I feel it's important to state that that what they're seeing is simply a representation of the high points where I'm like moving it forward or I'm pushing the attraction and if there are a lot of that is uploader I say front-loaded in the beginning of the interaction like I go up and I get a traction first then I get rapport most guys do what most guys who aren't trained in the stuff do what they go for rapport first then they do what then they go then they think once I get to rapport then I can go for a traction well it doesn't work that way because why would you want right the fuck would you want to get rapport with some random person you don't even know and so when you go up and you're asking all these boring questions the girls simply like why is this person that I don't even fucking know why is he asking me all this shit right so we get attraction first then we go for the rapport once we've got past the hook once we've got to have a sexual hook going so having said that we do front-load the attraction so a lot of it it's like I go up and I'm like different internet different internet gamble it'll you know saying all these ridiculous things outlandish things to indicate to her verbally that I want to pursue a romantic encounter as opposed to some boring platonic encounter where on her new best friend to go shopping for sweaters with but again once you have established attraction now you need to spend the requisite amount of time with her for her to feel okay about going with you and I always ask us why you know why do you think you have to spend that time like this additional like hour with the girls well even though she may very well be attracted you she needs to spend that hour to see if you're actually a fucking weirdo because the weirdo is not going to be able to keep up the mask over that hour he's going to say something weird he's going to do some weird shit the fucking mask is going to slip if she's gonna be like oh thank God I didn't go with him I spent that time and figured that out right so I this once too and he came up to me after the program in fact he actually sent me a message on facebook indicating this he said something to the effect of wow that really opened my eyes that I can do this that regular guys can do this because a lot of times when I watch videos with us on YouTube or other hospice or your hot seat for that matter in the beginning when I was first watching this when I first you know during the earlier stages in the program I thought to myself I can't do this I can't have this ability to shoot fireworks out my ass the whole time and just be the super charismatic guy hey hey-hey-hey-hey and me telling him that no there that's just to get the attractions there's you also need to get real you know to build that connection and so there's going to be a long stretches of downtime we were just acting normal like I always say there's two sides to my verbal game if you will there's like this um you know vulgar idiot slash cartoon pimp that says wacky shit and this is the guy that moves it forward this is the guy that gets her attention this is the guy that deals with other chose when they come in and like tools about this is the guy that basically makes the magic happen however this is it's also juxtaposed with this sort of again or Bane articulate conversations this is the real guy so if you're just this guy a lot of times there's no there there there's no depth to it and if the girls like I can't take this fucking guy seriously I'll grant it many girls will have no problem going with that individual you know that I fucked it was just fun I'm horny I don't get a shit you know and those go off with them however many many girls will not they need to see that okay this is kind of a tongue-in-cheek he's in on it you know he's in on the joke right and he's actually he can actually be real as well right so again very important to note whether you see with my videos Mac's videos Julian's PC hose where you see is just acting all crazy it's important to note that yes while Julian is just like crazy a real-life troll the reason that he's actually able to get the girls because he's also has that ability to connect to them and engage and relate with them on a very real more normal level and you should be able to do that too got to go back to the the old hostel tonight before we go out tonight got to finish up copy for the resonator program coming out June 21st sign up for the VIP list below here are risky resonator tom wonderful program in case you haven't heard basically it's my program dealing with vocal projection storytelling and humour I really wanted to delve deep into these topics because I felt that they were the topics that kind of got short shrift in the pickup's community they kind of got lip service nobody really you know that you always see these kind of like one-liners speak from the diaphragm and and so forth well I wanted to delve into the science I did that and I'm very proud of what we got check it out check out the previews when they're coming out soon and like I said sign up at Artie resonator to be put on the VIP list to be notified when the launch video is begin in the previews begin anyway this is Jeff I'll see you next time come fucking channel

master if you're to pick up women at the grocery store get some important dating tips and advice in this free video all right let's roll he's got a 6 shirt on 2007 ok looks around that you know the time the mystery show came out everyone was doing that peacocking shit do it everyone my name is allen co-founder of askromeo.com i name my last name it's fuckin askromeo.com i've never heard this guy champ it's weird it's like maybe like in you know like after the game came out and after the you know the vh1 show was on and it had you know PUA I kind of started to permeate the consciousness like so many people came out of the woodwork wanted to be a you know pickup coach damn but wonder how many people like ruin their lives just fell by the wayside I wonder what happened to Alan shit and Alan if you're out there I hope you're doing well alright fuck it let's hear it I'm here to show you how to meet a woman at a supermarket how to flirt flirting really is a conversation look at this chicks face so you just like  it's playful and fly playful and fun blind fool and fly and it dude you couldn't do a second take this is for fucking expert village dog this is fuckin an amateur village alright come on man step it up get together Alan playful and fun with sexual undertones or overtures so when you're joking around with a girl and you're flirting with her there's a couple of different ways you can do that obviously physical contact is important no no he immediately goes to the fucking the the creepy hand on the arm this shit sucks do not fucking do this or this or the hand on the fucking lower back don't do that shit okay why is it so bad in them itself well yes but secondly it's what every like literally 98% of fucking dudes are doing this shit and so what does it do it immediately slots you into the regular guy category again 90% of whom get just blown the fuck off so and you don't want some statistical roulette here you know you want something approximating consistency so and this ain't gonna do it buddy like this shit this needs to be a rat this shit it's hand on the lower back shit here and there especially like super early off in the interaction like it's just fucking done you're done done son you need to eradicate that shit from your lexicon so that she knows that you're interested in her more than just for conversation second is you know the mechanics is specifically how to flirt so teasing somebody an area that they're comfortable using a prop in an area so ace bandages all right here is exactly what you need you need one of these and you can actually wear it outside of your jeans yeah seriously you would look so cool with an ace bandage over your jeans you'll set a new fashion trend I noticed I mean it's not horrible it is just kind of lame it's just kind of dorky and lame I mean I remember we used to do we used to do something like that though we would uh at the fuck it at the supermarket row you know Walgreens back at his way back money this is from the early days with ESF we'd like go in the grocery store and what you do is you find something like you see the chick and then you go up and like pluck something off the shelf like something just innocuous like like this like fucking like cat treats and you'd like get the girl's attention you be like hey  this is awesome right that like you know some fucking toilet brush or some shit or like a can of beans you know I mean yeah I mean it worked it worked so all right all right Allen you right there by the pads too you know in case she's shark week he's gonna bitch dude you should have picked up the fucking pads and be like this is what you need this is what you need oh shit I could see Julianne doing that all right so we're using a prop and something that's obviously playful obviously not serious but it's something funny that she can think about and joke about at the same time I'm complimenting her fashion sense it allows her to compliment her own fashion sense and I get to be playful and joke with her about it second is a misinterpretation so taking something that she says the wrong way so are you getting ready to get out of here soon you have been shopping for hours what did you need that took you hours to find you haven't that much trouble finding stuff and what are you doing with ace bandages mm-hmm this guy asks a lot of questions man so she talks about ace bandages and I misinterpret leave it open to interpretation as to what she's talking about with ace bandage but again the core foundation for flirting is be playful be fun hold on dude that's not what fucking misinterpretation is I mean it is he literally did this interpreter but like again a misinterpretation should fear it sexual right so for example I had a girl say uh I had these glass and I found him in the band I was like I found him in the Banshees like I want to know what the van is like oh you want to go to the van again like misheard or go to the van like yeah right around the corner so hahaha right so that would be a good misinterpretation right something that moves it towards a romantic encounter as opposed to display tonic like that sounds like two girls chit-chatting I mean although I gotta say you know he's got the gist at like he's better than the last dude he's better than Park Bench pickup okay marginally and use physical contact to your advantage okay I mean I guess for what it was it was it was decent alright I give that one two stars two stars I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that completely automates the process to get me dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do this is execute the program version 2.0 the ruthlessly efficient highly repeatable system for the modern day online gangster it's over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of aim filled footage broken down case study and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you polar that night I covered the exact repeatable pattern takes to take a girl home nearly 85 percent of the time she agrees to meet up this is my online masterpiece at bottom line - just plain works now you have a choice to make keep using the Internet to beat off or use it to have someone else beat it off for you so decide how fast you wanna start getting laid and execute the program [Music],51UZXX2v8EE
what up it's your boy Jeffy I'm here today in the Japanese tea gardens and I've come to this tranquil and reflective setting in order to discuss a topic that I see come up quite frequently the HMDA forums and the inner circle groups and it's this should I get hookers in order to help my game it's very fitting don't you think but no seriously I do see this come up all the time and so I thought it's time we finally put the shit to bed and the answer the short answer is ah hell no ok all hell's naw no no in fact if you hear anyone even remotely entertain this is a good idea make a mental note to not take advice from this person ever again or listen to their advice at all okay and that's the short answer but we'll get into the longer answer here right now and we're gonna explore we're gonna look at it we're gonna we're gonna examine exactly why this is a terrible idea and the underlying reasons for that and the detrimental effects that could actually have on your game so let's do it  just standing here trying to think wracking my brain about like how exactly could this conceivably help I mean the I guess the idea is it'll get you reference experiences especially for like a newbie who has never even like touched a girl or something like that but you know honestly I think those there's better ways to even go about that and then the only real effect that these hookers are gonna have is to get you in trouble possibly with the authorities possibly they'll steal from you rob you that's a very common thing that happens and quite possibly get you sexually transmitted diseases which would make it even more difficult for you to actually get a girlfriend in the future it's like hey honey I guess I got to tell you before we take these things further and get more serious I have fucking herpes and chlamydia in the dick from hooking up with hookers in my past but aren't you glad that I got that experience cause it enabled me to get you right like that that ain't happening I mean think about this we've got in the community you already got the idea of no FAP aka not watching porn ostensibly allowing you to maintain motivation to actually go out and or stop you from you know getting from this porn unrealistic night ideas of how women respond and react I mean how is getting a prostitute any better than that it's not in fact it's much much worse the only time that I could conceivably think of advocating for actually getting a hooker would be like if you're super rich and you have like a shit ton of disposable income and you literally just want to get sex and you wanted to leave right the fuck after if it's literally just about like putting your dick in a wormhole that's not a fleshlight then that's probably the best option or potentially if you're like a famous person you know you're like some kind of basketball player or like again charleshayne a famously he said what I don't pay I like hookers cuz I'm not paying them for the sex I'm paying for them to leave afterwards without incident okay like in their knocking you know he's paying high-class girls that are like ideally aren't gonna be stealing from him and they're professional so not gonna be like putting him on blast you know like Drake like trying to slide into Mia Khalifa's dm's and she like posts his tax and like it so everyone can mock and ridicule him look the celebrity tried to get laid lol what an idiot you know and again if you are celebrity or your famous we want to avoid those kind of messy those messy drama incidents after the fact then that might be one reason or again if you're super super rich you don't have time you're like you know what it's got a bus went out like fuck it and again like paying five hundred bucks would be the equivalent to us like paying like the dollar menu at McDonald's or something then yeah by all means go for it but outside of those extremely narrow circumstances I'm gonna say I get I'm gonna go on record and say this is actually a terrible terrible idea so again literally if you just want to get your dick wet and are willing to pay then by all means go for it but certainly don't try to fool yourself into believing that you're somehow improving your game because the bottom line is you're not I mean honestly if you get to the point where you're seeking to pay for sex for any reason you lost me dude I mean and honestly it's not like about your honor or anything of that nature it's more about the underlying frame which is what being absolutely needy it's gonna undermine you in a lot of ways I mean look honestly if you're that desperate just lower your standards a little bit like go on tinder lower your standards go out to the bar lower your standards and you're gonna have some kind of encounter okay if that's what it's really about at the end of the day then that's probably the way you actually want to go and a lot of girls will say well you know so what's wrong with paying you're always paying in some one way or another you know if you go to the club you're spending money on drinks if you go out on a dinner you're spending money on that dinner it's like dude motherfucker I was gonna be going out of having those drinks regardless you know I'm gonna go drinking regardless whether or not they're there you understand so look the thing is I'm not viewing this as purely transactional do you understand like I it's not about that for me it's about enjoying an interaction it's about possibly enriching another person's life by being charismatic and coming up to her in that way and then you know taking it further it's about enriching my own life maybe I'm learning something from interacting with them as well so it's not only about the hunt and kind of like that feeling of satisfaction that you get from you know having been charming enough to actually get the girl attract to you but it's also about the interplay in the experience so if you're coming at this from the standpoint that women are just basically vaginas with like interchangeable heads that go on them then honestly that's probably a big reason why you're not having success in the first you understand it's that mental it's like that mental approach is probably what's causing you to actually not have the results you want that lack of empathy I mean you could also say that you're paying with your time right even if you don't spend a single dime and you hang out with the girl like you got to hang out with her for several hours no no no no I don't want to spend the time it's like look dude anything you do costs time look time is literally the only commodity that we have on this earth all right not money at the end of the day the economy could fail and then your money be fucking worthless not respect it'll disrespect they've disrespected me if I do what does that really mean somebody made some noises in the air that offended you again it has no quantifiable actual effect on your life but you know people take it to heart like no literally the only commodity you have is time and look you have to choose where to spend your time I understand that and even me being here right now doing this video is costing my time it is costing my finite amount of minutes on this planet to be here making this video it's an investment that I'm making because I know the return will be worth it for me and what's the return the satisfaction I get knowing that thousands of people are gonna watch this and hopefully it's gonna help some people who might be kind of misguided on this issue and prevent them from stunting their success in the future so it's worth it for me just because of that reason now another reason people might say well you know if I go out with the hookers I can try things crazy things sexually in bed or something and get more reference experience it's about sex it's like look if you're not getting the kind of sex you want with girls you're actually going out with then you're probably not being like dominant enough in bed or being like you know assertive enough in bed I know plenty of guys who go out and try a crazy shit I mean lord knows I have so again that's definitely possible guys are doing this every day without the need to resort to these prostitutes the bottom line is with this idea you're looking for magic pill shortcuts to getting to the place where you're the man you want to be try to avoid doing the work there is no avoiding of doing the work okay don't disrespect the process don't disrespect all the other guys who are toughing it out at the clubs who are toughing it out in front of their keyboards you know on the online game you cannot take that shortcut you cannot disrespect the process it's like come on dude just go on dates just go on if you have execute the program follow that system you'll get tinder dates easily you'll can easily quite easily rack up a date every single night if you take in the principles in that program and you go on like ten twenty thirty of those dates some of those are inevitably gonna end up in sex right Gary nine cooking up with those people why because girls just want to have fun then you want it to happen too and beyond that you could just go to the club and you know going out there enough it's like I tell guys like go out like especially after boot camp I'm like don't get a girlfriend for six months even though you think it's hard now you're gonna go out and you're gonna get laid and you're gonna like the curl and you're gonna like well why don't I hang out with her more you know right after boot camp and you won't give you time to internalize the lessons because again I know these guys are gonna go out the shit ain't that hard because as the great philosopher from the 20th century Cyndi Lauper said girls just want to have fun so if you go out and you're just like not a complete retard eventually you are gonna get laid you're gonna get that experience and then you're going to have built that experience on a solid foundation not this weird false disturbing hooker foundation right which is really a foundation of shifting sands it's a loser II and I know a lot of guys when they're first starting they doubt that they can do it right they literally doubt that they can do it but I say this all the time if you saw myself or Tyler when we first started you would have zero zero doubts then you could replicate anything that you see us do myself max Julian whoever because when we started off we were starting from like severe emotional deficits it wasn't like these well-adjusted fellows like going out and doing this stuff it's like fuckin psychos who are like barely able to cut converse without like throwing people into like a frenzy of anger and rage right so again if we could do it you can do it right the the path is there the sad truth of being so desperate that you have to pay a hooker is that it is the impediment of me deenis it is truly the epitome of media's right and remember there is perhaps no more unattractive characteristic than neediness so just by doing that you're reinforcing that belief system that's exude out of you and again I got to tell you the sub communications are so important and when you actually go out to talk to real girls that sort of tone is going to leach into the interaction they'll be able to sense it so essentially what you're doing is you're again undermining your future success by doing this when you hear us talk about being like a man on your path it it means not falling into what Owen might call low vibrational energy taking the easy way out we're talking about Matt being a man on your path it means you're trying to build something you're trying to create you're trying to enrich yourself and become a better person and live in accordance with certain values that you aspire to every single day okay it's about building towards something and to quote our friend Elliott Hulse it's not about what you get it's about what you're becoming again being on that path being conscious of it and striving to move towards being a better you not just looking for this easy way out and get disrespecting the process and there's another old saying and pick up and you probably heard it before and it goes like this there are two ways to get the girl one way is to become an amazing manipulator the other is to become an amazing man right so again one way is the easy way by doing like a cash transaction which ultimately is going to generate feelings of shame and disgust and the other way is about putting in the work and actually improving yourself and that's gonna generate feelings of you Mason liberation and pride and beyond that it's actually permanent not fleeting and and not just some temporary thing it's a permanent thing you're gonna take with you always so again if you're watching this resolve to do the work put in the work that's required to like gain that charisma you get the emotional leverage on yourself and say you know what I'm gonna tough it out no matter what it takes to actually build something permanent to build that charisma that's gonna actually give me a give me a traction from from real live women and again you're gonna be so much better off doing that if you do tough it out eventually you will get there and when you do get there you'll realize that getting laid wasn't actually what you wanted but becoming the man who was worthy of her attention it's been Jeffy don't get hookers and see you next time I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I

to take a girl home nearly 85% of the time she agrees to meet up with me this is my online masterpiece at bottom-line des just plain works now you have a choice to make keep using the Internet to beat off or use it to have someone else beat it off for you so decide I'll fasten one started getting laid and execute the program [Music],51_Hfd_d9K0
yo what I'll put up this tree boy Jeffie aka Donald Trump jr. aka trillionaire Jesus and I'm here today with a quick video I got a lot of stuff in the pipeline a lot of infield to sort through for my travels recently but today I want to again just fire off a quick one directed at new guys in the game newbies coming up in the game about some pitfalls that you want to avoid when you're first getting into the game and I came up with this idea for this video today in fact when I was perusing the forums and there's a lot of stuff I see on there up guys you know I'm wringing their hands about how how will I get over the rejection my confidence is being destroyed I'm just starting to go out I see other guys that are doing better than me it's making me hate humanity and shit like this and look number one thing that I can tell a guy starting out is this make sure that you keep the focus on having fun when you go out keep the focus on having fun now look I get it it's true that when you're first going out and you're learning any skill for that matter the initial stages are going to be marked by confusion and frustration a lot of the time rather than woo you know awesome having a great time just like with any ceil like if I'm trying to learn how to ski or snowboard am I gonna be like effortlessly carving down the mountain you know enjoying life as though as the wind whips past my face no I'm gonna be falling out in eating fucking snow a great deal of the time so I get it it can be confusing and frustrating when you first start but if you get caught it's called the game it's not called the work so ultimately the point is to enjoy yourself and you need to keep that in mind when you're first starting out it otherwise you're they can actually have fairly deleterious effects on your mental and physical well-being you can raise cortisol levels which can wreak all kinds of havoc in your body and make you get sick and stuff like that so again while it is important to be direct to be intelligent about your growth so to speak and be honest where you're fucking up look at the end of the day you've got to go out there with the mentality that I'm just fucking around I'm just having fun I'm seeing what's possible right that's how I always felt when I was was starting out like I'm just gonna see what's possible I'm gonna fuck around and at the end of the day it really didn't mean that much to me right I was like oh the rejection I mean look this is over 15 years ago so I'm sure if I went back in time I know that there were moments that were you know there was darkness where I was just like sitting there at home after not you know another night out of getting ridiculed and not pulling where I thought to myself shit man what are you doing you know you're not getting better I just want to quit when you're speaking to fool yourself at cetera but those moments were few and far between mostly when I think back in those times it was just like I was just having a ball fuckin with shit was it it was like real life trolling right so keep the focus positive and keep the focus on having fun that's tip number one tip number two like who you are right now this is huge okay you want to be compassionate towards yourself and again even when I was first starting out and I was striking out pretty much most of the time when I went out not even getting past the hook point I I still thought of myself as a cool person right and in fact I put out a throwback Thursday picture of my Facebook recently of me like in say maybe 2004 2005 where I just look absolutely miserable at this corporate job that I had and people are like you evolved from a chode and now you're great in you know what my recollection of how I felt about myself during that time was I thought that guy was pretty cool in fact she's probably at a shitty job was kinda out of shape but but aside from that I thought that I was pretty cool so rather than focusing on what's bad about you right now focus on what you do like so you can move forward another thing to bear in mind is you know I used to do all kinds of affirmations back in the day I'd be like I don't need anyone girl I'm unapologetic for my desires as a man etc etc I'd repeat this stuff that I was like getting better in every way in it every day right you know I'd have a variety of affirmations that I would say and again it can be kind of corny when you're sitting there repeating these affirmations to yourself but any little bit is gonna help especially when you're first starting out maintaining that positive attitude another thing when you're focusing on goals that you want to attain don't make those goals necessarily so results based per se like like I want it like I want to fuck a stripper or I want to fuck you know a girl every week for the next month or whatever you know things of that nature try to focus on the self-development improvements as opposed to like the more base sexual gratification improvements right and when you have that mentality it can make the going a lot easier so again focus on the stuff that you do like about yourself currently for example like I go out even when I don't want to I'm going hard at this and I'm gonna get it regardless of what happens right and secondly on what you want to attain like I want to become a more centered person I want to become a more present person I want to become a person with a strong confidence and a strong sense of reality as opposed to again the more superficial goals finally when you're getting into this stuff it's gonna be very natural for you to want to accomplish everything immediately fucking yesterday even but my experience has shown that it's you got to be in it for the long haul right so simple gradual changes made over a long term or what is gonna result in that deep lasting identity level change right you've really got to start to look at this on the long-term I mean it's very very easy to get wrapped up in the peaks and valleys right so you might have one week where you're absolutely kicking ass and then you might have three weeks where you're in a bit of a slump and nothing seemed nothing seeming to work and you can't get fucking no satisfaction as Mick Jagger said but again I've had plenty of those cyclicals ups and downs and it I remember at the time it seems like everything that happened before was just a dream all the achievements that you had were just like like something you read about in a book didn't that happen to you and you're never gonna see the light at the end of the tunnel but again it's inevitable provide and it's in fact I even dare say that this kind of cyclicals stuff is healthy just like you you work out your rest when do you get the growth when you're actually performing the reps know during the rest period so the same could be said for pickup when you go out you're you're slanting approaches that's you're actually performing the repetitions but you need time to internalize that and put that stuff into the context of not only the overall game but of your life itself so these down times they're natural and you'll see as time goes on they'll become less and less you know become less less pronounced so in turn your you you get more of a group like a a steady gradual improvement so in fact so again you don't want to be myopic where you're like just in it at the moment try to take a step back look at the big picture and you won't see those peaks and valleys you'll see more of a gradual sloping improvement over time so again there's just a couple little tips for guys starting out to kind of avoid the pitfalls of negativity that are often waiting for you as a guide just getting into this stuff bear in mind the end the day is just a skill and as I said before it's called the game not the work and the point is to enjoy yourself Jeffie I'll see you next week  you,5YnMGhEKH4g
how to deal with holiday loneliness a lot of people they they see this time as sort of a down a down time in terms of like romantic encounters okay I've going out and meeting people because let's face it it can be a bit of a disheartening experience it can be a bit of a frustrating time in folk don't get uptight but I sucked another dick last night you're like you did what last night so yeah I've been listening to this new country album by a dude called wheeler Walker jr. and will Walker jr. it's kind of like a comedian but he's also musically very very the music's very good I don't even like country but you know the dude's pretty talented and that's one of his songs I sucked another dick last night a couple of others are all the pussy you will slay which is one of my that's probably my personal favorite off the album it's a touching tribute to his son is his young infant son talking about when he grows up how much pussy he'll get and it's got beautiful harmonies if you watch the video for it he's got his actual son in the video and it's quite touching it's very poignant it literally brought a tear to my eye the first time I heard it so if you're interested you should check that out wheeler Walker jr. is the guy's name in fact you know what let's actually play that right now and I'll do a little sing-along for you  daddy's cock in a few short years you'll be ready to rock my son and boy we'll have some fun you just came out of a pussy hole you'll be back in one before you know young man let more than you can stand and I never ever felt like this before it's son I couldn't love you more [Music] the pussy you will slay someday they'll be giving it away  you'll be munching so much much just wave on the pussy you will slay someday  okay this is a good one how to deal with holiday loneliness the thing about this okay let's talk about the holidays a little bit since this is a holiday you know time the holiday times are upon us you're nondenominational rst holiday is upon you whether it's the Kwanzaa whether it's the you know Hanukkah Christmas what-have-you the fucking Festivus or some sort of pagan atheistic satanic rituals that you're performing around the home now is the time now is the time where friends and family come together to revel in the in the magical holiday time and a lot of people it's a bit of a double-edged sword I'd say because a lot of people they they see this time as sort of a down a down time in terms of like romantic encounters okay I've going out and meeting people because let's face it if you're on tinder it can be a bit of a fuck shit it might not allow to say that way if we can't put this on YouTube so if you're on tinder it can be a bit of a disheartening experience it can be a bit of a frustrating time because it seems like everyone's traveling and and everyone's out there you know it's difficult to set things up the scheduling is difficult even from people that you met out you know say you met them out at a bar you met them out in public at some other venue and you're attempting to schedule a meet-up you know a secondary meetup to get to know each other better and perhaps engage in some romantic activities it can be a bit frustrating due to the holidays however I would pose a counterpoint you know it's like I said it's a bit of a double-edged sword because when people are so so the people that you may have met in town they might be out of town however there other people that are coming into town to visit their family during this time and you know your family let's face it a lot of the time they if you love even if you love them they can get under your skin in ways that many other people cannot and you can only deal with them for a limited amount of time so they will be looking at some point to get the Frick out of the house okay they want to get out of the house and they want to get away from their family get a break from it so what you'll often see is you'll see the younger members of the family you know cuz let's face it you probably got like the elders you know grandpa and grandma on the old the older aunts and uncles and all that and then you got like your cousins and the far-flung siblings perhaps that I've all come together and you're like guys we got to get out of here let's just like go into town and you know kind of heat just hit up a bar just to get a kind of a break from all this so in many ways these holidays and not just not just Christmas but also Thanksgiving it can be the best times to do the pickup it can actually be the best in fact my last girlfriend I actually met because it was on Thanksgiving and she was like she's one of the get out of the house and so she likes again you know schedule something and in fact this also happened this year as well so this is like the secret of you know everyone thinks so which holiday is the best to do like pickup or whatever and it's not that I mean Valentine's Day is incredible I'm auditioning on Valentine's Day Valentine's Day still is the best but you know a lot of people say things like oh the big major holidays like you know you know where people go out and party like Halloween for example all the girls are dressed up like slutty bumblebee or whatever like it's the best time actually no because that's the time when people like the couples who never actually go out they're like well it's the big event time to go out for the big event a couple partner of mine and they get all dressed up and they go out for the big event and then you know often they're getting intoxicated and they'll have like some kind of fight or something like this but a lot of times what you'll find out like I'm in Halloween and New Year's for example that's another one you'll you'll do all these approaches and then it's like no my boyfriend's right there my boyfriend my boyfriend my boyfriend because that's the only time that these couples ever go out and then again it's kind of funny to watch the so-called trouble in paradise unfold near the end of the night because again they likely never go out the guy may be unaccustomed to dealing with people speaking to his his partner and flirting with her and he can all get some jealousy fit and then the alcohol exacerbates that and it's like this big disaster so those counter-intuitively are not the best in fact on new years most of the time I just kind of hang out at home like I don't probably because like I go out every other night of the year and I just don't want to deal with the amateur hour or I'll just go to like some you know like a like a calm local event in my neighborhood or something like that but but again the secret is Thanksgiving and also Christmas to a lesser extent or gets an equal extent because you will get those those people who just want to get away from the fam and that's the perfect time to go out it's a perfect time to go out and meet people it's the perfect time to be on tinder tinder will be on fire it will be blowing up in this like next week or so what is it today it's uh what almost in the 18th so yeah like this weekend and all through next week it should be pretty good so fire it up polish up dust off the old profiles and get swiping kids go outside go to the local pub and meet the a  dysfunctional family members good times good times these are like some of the pro suits in fact you know along those those lines up so the so called secrets of the professional I'm a lot of times guys they think they want to go out on like the weekend like obviously the weekend is gonna be the best time to go out because that's when the most people are out that's when you have the most opportunity to to meet someone etc etc but and that's true there's gonna be a lot of people out there's a lot of volume a lot of opportunities to meet the person who's gonna be you're gonna have that chemistry with right and who's gonna have the perfect logistics and who's gonna really click with you and who wants the same things you do and you you make it happen however I would also put forth this argument that on the weekend it's more of like an event right they're like okay guys peer group consisting of ten people we're gonna have the event it's time for the the big Friday event yes let's get prepared let's take an hour and a half to you know to prepare our clothing and appearance and attire get ready let's also then pregame at the home for some time now let's go out there and it's a big to-do and I'm out here with all my friends like what's that movie a barfly was like my friends a drink from my friends right so they're all there together and this can complicate matters logistically right well you know I'm the designated driver or I came with all of them and you know everyone's kind of like ensuring that the group stays stays whole and so it's so working you know that's a bit of a drop-in now conversely during the week and this is what I call the secrets of the professional right Sunday through Thursday those can often be the best days because if you find people out then it's typically more casual they probably decided to go out on a whim you know maybe they're just having a rough day they wanted to go out and blow off a little steam or they were just catching up with one other old friend or there just hell they just want to get out of the house much more casual there's gonna be a lot less of that whole rigmarole surrounding it like who it's like a big thing the event the event so if you go out on a Wednesday and I'd say at least like half of my poles from cold approach IRL called approach have have been Sunday through Thursdays right so you know five days versus two yet half and half so you do the math right um a lot of times those people are gonna be a lot more open to new experiences so to speak and so again you and like a lot of the time too you don't need to and I always tell guys this at the end of the program you don't need to be going out on these like marathon sessions all the time like we do that on the bootcamp you know we're there for four hours and we're going over curriculum running exercises know that all that good stuff but you know during the week yeah sure maybe you have like a big marathon session now and then but during the week you can just pop into the local pub after work you know just stick your head in see who's there maybe chat a couple of people up just a you know dust off the old social and verbal muscles and if something comes of that great if not cool you know you just pop back home and then you're also building social proof in your local bar right with the with the actual employees and then you're the man every time you come in hey what's up Jeff duh and it's just a cool time in general you're building your social skills and then again a lot of times you're gonna get that one person or like the lone girl who's just there popped in for a drink you know maybe she just broke up with her boyfriend and she's just kind of looking for that rebound feller and I'm there to serve that purpose another kind of little little hint I always talk about is karaoke you know I'm a huge karaoke fan if you weren't able to tell by my wonderful rendition of wheeler Walker juniors all the pussy you can slay earlier but I wish they had that shit at karaoke dude I fucking wish they did but it's brand new just came out last week wheeler Walker jr. his albums called ww3 which is named after his son wheeler Walker the third but yeah they don't have that shit it would be pretty cool if they did though um but um a lot of great songs on that album including anal and the dishes which is a rumination on family life you know he gave up his partying lifestyle you know what it's one of the lyrics it's like cocaine day he's a da home now will get high but mowing the lawn like shit shit of that nature  but anyway yeah karaoke it's funny because even on like an off night you can pop in at the karaoke bar and of course I'm not talking about the one with like the private rooms I'm talking about like the one with the stage and the public audience and stuff people will go there even on an off night like I can dip in there out of Sunday like I went last Sunday and it was packed I was like damn what is this usually I kind of pop in there early on a Sunday just I can like practice songs and stuff and uh this fucking packed I was what's going on here and he's like my buddy who goes there this this guy Yanni he's like jiffy I hate these people I do not know what they come for I think he's Greek or something long story short is uh yeah even I'm like an off-night people go to the karaoke why because it's like a destination spot you don't I mean they'll be like oh you know it's like a work party or like a going-away party you're like Sarah's birthday party or something like that and you know you'll get people at this place on a night where no one really goes out because it's a destination spot right so just a couple little tips to get you through that holiday loneliness get up the karaoke bar hit up the tinder I mean it's not as bad as you think again a bit of a double-edged sword you're gonna get a lot of traveling people in town we're just looking to get away and you know make the most of it you can truly make the most of it and enjoy your happy magical holiday season I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that completely automates the process to get any dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do it's over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of the infield footage broken down case Network and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you polar that night I covered the exact repeatable pattern takes to take a girl home nearly 85% of the time she agrees to meet up with me at bottom line did just plain works beside Oh fasten wanna start getting laid and execute the program [Music],5uEw8G9Fhys
with the openers like a lot of guys that suggested me that they're still in that sort of the headspace of the opener is some sort of like magical discrete thing from everything else okay like they're going to go up and use their awesome rad Tron opener and then they can just go tada and it goes gonna be like oh shit time to time to fuck you know so but the thing is there's it's all there's no follow-through it's like you're going up like all hard you got your awesome opener you like it's a bunt but boom boom boom womp womp right so there's no fucking follow-through you got us an opener is nothing opener is simply the first second of conversation that's it now what is the secret to nonstop conversation it's a little something called vibing what's that do you guys know what that is vibing can anyone explain define describe just like loose it listed eight elusive it basically it's kind of like a non goal-oriented conversation that is designed to pump both your in her emotional states right that's it that is the only goal there's a couple of principles with vibing that you should internalize number one what you have to say is valuable simply by virtue of the fact that it comes from you you have to you have to believe that - the girl is going to find it interesting not because of the content but rather because she wants to know what you find interesting number three lower the bar lower the bar for how good it has to be this does not have to be like Chris Rock winning you know comic material nor does have to be like Nobel Prize winning discourse is whatever for be in the moment don't think ahead don't be thinking what do I do next what do I cynics is what does that go back to trying to impress these trying to impress behaviors go deep as fuck and they're very subtle they're very very subtle it took me ten years to eradicate it and still I'll still catch myself doing it like subtle little like oh if I say this they'll think I'm cool with what if I do this they'll think I'm cool how about this do you like me now I see like especially novice more novice students I'm like what if I do this do you like me now do you like me now now do you like me now with us it's like we like us do you fuck off then like it's obnoxious we're completely fucking obnoxious you can't be half a gangster right you cannot if you're going to be that you're going to be in this game you got to be in it for real and that means you're willing just go super hard you're willing to look bad you don't give a shit like look my friend Ryan who was briefly an instructor with the company I trained him up and while I was training him he's like he's like Jeff he was like making these observations about my game he's like many guys you know most guys they'd rather they go up to five girls and say for the interactions go okay and maybe they hook up with one of the girls he's like you on the other hand you go up and three of the girls immediately despise you like they just hate you okay but you'll hook up with both the other two because it's polarizing what does that go back to your core confidence there's no trying to impress about me at all I mean look at my fucking haircut okay there's nothing like oil do you think I'm cool like it's like look this is this is it take it or leave it nowadays we go quick or beast mode and it's a lot more efficient I'm not attached to any like dogmatic fucking style or anything like that I'm attached to efficiency and I'm attached to vagina like my dog by the dong that is where the attachment takes place and so I I don't care about allah khair betters result bottom line result so whatever works now what's the one commodity we have in this game there's like one commodity that you have in this game that you cannot replace time that's so again man to woman man to woman it's very evident now why you're going to have to take your dick out at some point aren't you if you intend to have sex with them your dick is going to have to come out at some point unless you're able to like Esther Lee project your dong or something in which case more power to you but I'd rather get that out of the way sooner than later and when I say take your dick out I mean that kind of in a figurative sense you want to get that out there criteria for success approach man to woman and three self amuse so if I'm doing those three things generally how it's going to shake out if you guys go out there and do that if I could even a novice guy goes out there and does that it's going to shake out like this a third a third a third those girls are going to be like fuck off like right away to me yeah yeah right right away I like that I like that you know why means I just saved some time because that's the only commodity we have there's a limited number of minutes in the night there's a limited number of days in the fucking year years in your life right so I just saved myself some time the second third are going to be highly attracted interested you know they'll be like damn what's this I like this guy then they're going to see it you know and then it's going to be up to you to screen for logistics and actually make it happen take your passion and make it happen pictures come alive you can dance right through your life oh oh oh what a feel okay so so then the third group though and that's this is the one you got to watch out for in my opinion the third group is going to be like think you're cool but for whatever reason not be down so we call that ha ha ha but no right there ah but no now this is the group you got to watch out for why waste of time cuz they probably got boyfriend's sitting at home playing PlayStation Derka Derka Derka right and she's out with her friends from work is probably some like going-away party for Wendy from marketing at the karaoke bar alright and so she probably is even like these people she's their out of obligation and then here comes man-whore what's up girl you know and she's like oh he my boyfriend don't do this he just plays halo and ignores me and and what happens if she stops hogging him two man-whore well then she has to go back to fucking Matilda from sales and hang out with her so she will you know she'll be hahaha but ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha they will defer that but no as long as possible well how do we get them say but no right quick little something we call mouth-rape ok so I want to find out within 10 or 20 minutes if it's on and you know this trickles over into everything when your beast mode what is beast mode beast mode means this number one you see the hot girl and you take action without thought or hesitation there is no thought there is no hesitation there was only action that is it so beast mode what that means it's taking action without thought or hesitation and to playing to win playing to win we don't care about getting blown out we don't give a shit because why we're going up and we're being authentic so the way we look at it it's simply we're determining whether or not we have chemistry with this person right I'm just seeing if I have chemistry there's no chemistry move on and guys say well that sounds like a numbers game to me well yeah it is because guess what the shit is a fucking numbers game at the end of the day fucking nerds want to talk shit oh yeah you know what about I want 100% consistency you live in a dream that shit ain't real all right now again if this style did not get me more pussy I would abandon it in a heartbeat but the fact of the matter is this stuff's getting me laid more and not only that it's like less work and more fun there's not what it's all about because if you want to have long-term sustainability you can't be up in the club like oh this is you know like what do i do my TAC instant shave you know you got to be in the club yeah drink boobies yay and this I think is kind of the cornerstone of game this is kind of like the foundation of game in many ways is becoming completely comfortable with your sexuality and expressing that because why don't guys want to express it they think oh it's embarrassing oh I'll get blown out through the dirt it's like dude it's their problem not yours man right if they got these hang-ups and shit that's that's their problem not yours now of course we don't care what people think but we care how we're making them feel but at the same time I'm not going to hinder I'm not going to try to micromanage other people's perception of me this is why we don't get LMR and shit a couple of reasons number one there's there's no ambiguity at all number two we're very comfortable with it you know most roads aren't so last minute resistance like when you get to grow back we have a saying there's no LMR in the van there's no second no LMR in the van because the thing is do you think any girl in a right mind is going to agree to be alone with us in that van before she's decided I'm gonna have sex with this guy so acting my assistant fucks dudes in there she's shit yeah she she has a quota she she can only fuck what a month because I don't want to look like a gay van but the thing is the VIP this the stencils on the back that's not like some braggadocio macho scoreboard that's a that's a record of history it's inside it it's not it's not like oh I'm so cool with my score no it's like this is what happened right it's like it's like you're telling so  you,6GKMG7JNYEA
hi there it is I your proverbial boy cheffy AKA vampire potter karaoke champion van owner and hot tub enthusiasts and what i want to talk to you about today is what I think is really one of the cornerstones the fundamental bedrock concepts of game and that's the idea of logistics the broad concept of logistics and understanding how to circumnavigate logistical nob cycles when you're doing cold approach pickup and I truly truly truly believe that the importance of this cannot be overstated ok it's right up there with with fundamental things like eye contact okay with fundamental things like smiling stuff like stuff like that bringing good vibe etcetera etc now why is this so important well I think when a lot of guys first start out they have a tendency to focus on the mechanical aspects of game they have a tendency to focus on what do I say how do I approach etc and that stuff's all I get it that stuff's absolutely necessary you need to learn the mechanics of game but once you get past a certain point and and I'd say for me it didn't take very long to understand the structure of a pickup and how it worked and the basic building blocks of a pickup and to be honest if I was to relay to you my learning curve I'd say it was like this the first year was spent sort of re-engineering my belief systems around how Attraction work around how dating actually worked over on what women found attractive etc etc you know unwire alot of social conditioning the second year was spent figuring out and fine-tuning the mechanics the tactical stuff the the nuts and bolts how to stuff I'd say for guys learning right now it wouldn't even necessarily take a couple of years maybe the the unwire engaging and pecking in the dark like myself and tyler and the originators and the early you know and then the Neolithic Age of pickup where we were literally hunting and pecking the dock to figure out the the principles for most guys starting out now you've got videos much like this you've got rst programs and you know you're standing on the shoulders of giants if you will or standing on the shoulders of midgets I guess if you so it's not gonna take most guys that long to learn the basics of pickup but once you get that down and you know how to do it and you have a base of competence the real factor the the great equalizer if you will becomes the ability to discern and deal with different logistical scenarios dynamically as they arise in field so let's talk about what I mean by this now first off logistics it's not even necessarily a question of dealing with what's being thrown at you in the field there's to flip sides to the coin of logistics that's one of them get the other side of the coin of logistics is what it's making that sure that your logistics are ideal before you eat you even set foot in the club right that needs to be dialed and that needs to be handled ideally before you even go out again guys are so focused on stuff like what's the crazy new dramatic flair technique you know the wild opener Julianne's drama the October man technique these like flashy things and they don't even have basics down we're talking about shit like fucking hygiene dude a lot of guys they come on these programs and it smells like they've been chewing on assholes I don't care how tight your game is bro if it smells that you've been chewing on diarrhea assholes she's not gonna kiss you so that's that's one thing that we talk about things like setting up basically just achill things like a guy lives 50 miles away now I've always said and this is my been a huge proponent of this a newbie who has ideal logistics is gonna get laid way more than even an advanced guy with shit logistics so what are we talking about here let's say you've got advanced guy new guy in the club it's going super good like what is that what does the new me have to say like so say he's got ideal logistics he lives across the street he lives across the street from the club he's like hey you want to go mart Mario karts it's right there it's literally right there like she's much more like okay it's not that much of an investment I can just dip across NBD right whereas you got this advanced guy should even really likes the AI he's very charming you know he's got his shit on unlock and then at the end of nine she's like okay what's up she said well now we have to do like an hour drive to Tiburon in my car she's like yeah that's like an a-hole additional layer of complexity and a whole additional look she's like I'm not gonna get in a car with someone and drive an hour I don't care how much I don't character prince charming right so that's what we're talking about when we're talking about getting your logistics dialed in okay an advanced guy with shooting logistics is not gonna get laid simply as much as the new guy or let's not say late let's say Paul right because the new guy who lives across street with Mario Cart he'll probably pull every night he's probably not actually gonna get laid every night he's gonna probably flub it back to the house but again he's gonna be having a lot more opportunities and a lot more experience and he's gonna get advanced much much better than if he had a newbie starting out with shit logistics so get your logistics dialed you know there's you know there's a number of ways to approach this you could also get a van you know in which case is parked right around the club and then you know that's even less of an investment in fact that's one reason one of the major reasons why I got the man so I can be like yo let's just go you know go to my car this oh I got something in my car let's go check it out boom and we're literally back to the club within 20 minutes and the friends are none the wiser because that's a big thing she's like oh I left my friends this and that they're there I can't leave them well you don't have to leave them you can simply come to the van and then be back to the club and no one will know right so get your logistics dial that's number one do what you can control what you can control before you start to worry about how to deal with what's being thrown at you in field but now let's look at the flip side of that and the flip side of that is as I just said knowing how to deal with different logistical obstacles circumnavigate them and still get it done and some of the best guys that I have ever known in the game we're guys who were masters of this like I said all things being equal on any given Sunday if you will if you guys got guys who were pretty good a game the guy who's gonna get laid more on in a given situation is the guy that's able to deal with those things as they as they crop up right who has a lot of experience there's a lot of intuition and how to deal with that so when we're talking about this ability to deal with unfolding things basically it comes down to intuition attunement and creating the logical possibility I know a lot of guys who are into this stuff also follow Joe Rogan if you watch real Rogan spy guess you probably hear him say this phrase MMA its high-level problem-solving with dire physical consequences that's like a trademark Joe ISM but I'd say that that phrase it sort of applies to pick up when you're dealing with logistics as well now obviously there's not dire physical consequences there's awesome physical consequences if you get it done right that it's not so well maybe dire if you catch some sort of disease or you know pregnancy or something like that or you know the husband comes after you but but again high-level problem-solving with dire physical consequences what do you what he means the way he describes MMA the the approach at least mentally jujitsu for him it's like this dynamic situation where you're constantly trying to figure out the solution while you've got this other sentient you know intellect that's actively trying to prevent you from achieving that goal now here's the thing what we're talking about the other person isn't necessarily actively trying to prevent you but they'll be throwing stuff up maybe the Friends of the girl are actively trying to prevent this so again it's a similar type of the attitude you're bringing to it right you've got to like be able to see how things were unfolding and adapt in the moment and maybe you're you've taken one tack you have to be have that flexibility where you're like okay this isn't working I'm gonna try something else so say for example you try to go for the pole and she's you know reluctant to do so or you know she throws up the friends objection or she's like not right now you need to try a different tack again one thing that we always talk about and you probably heard me talk about this in many videos is the idea of the yellow light like not yet don't give up don't get frustrated look for a different angle try a different tack suggest a different a different option for if she doesn't want to like go to this place like option B now I remember I was in Miami for World Summit and we were coming out of SLS and I had this girl I've been talking to her for a long time she was super into me and literally I walk her down the block and I'm like where are we going like well we're going to a wonderful place it's called my apartment she's like my friends my friends might look are they good friends she's like yes they're my best ones were like then they'll understand and she's like hahaha very funny and like I continue to try to go and she's like no actually no and this girl she was actually like a boxing instructor she's like look Jeff don't make me knock you the fuck out I'm like okay okay can we go back to the friends so I went back to the friends and kicked it with the friends for a while and then what I ended up doing is I took we brought all the friends back to the home and then I was able to isolate her in a room after that like shortly after that so but again I tried again I didn't get flustered and that's a big thing to not getting flustered in the moment when these up when these obstacles arrive and using your brain and that's why I think it's very important to learn again to get those mechanics dialed because the thing is once you got the mechanics dialed you it opens up spaces in your brain where you now have CPU processing power to actually think about this stuff whereas before you're so focused on the moment like what do I say next what do I do next and by the way this is why a lot of times guys will come to my hot seat and they're kind of shocked and how much can stuff I use right now note I use a lot I do say a lot of the same phrases when it comes to saving some a tent I can't really use a lot the same openers etc etc and that's not as a crutch because I don't know what to say I'm just I'm using that as a way to so I don't have to think about this stuff that stuff's on lock that stuff's like press a press B so again what am i focusing on I'm focusing on what's important I don't want to be in like myopic and like right here in the moment I want to be thinking a big-picture stuff which is what or my being emotionally what did he get adjustable popsicles that are people brought up in my face I can circumnavigate in order to get the fucking job done right so again once you get those basic style that opens up spaces in your brain you're gonna be able to think about that it's all about embracing this idea of creative problem solving right I was hanging out with my buddy Brendon in San Diego and he and he we're just kicking it on he was actually helping me out on bootcamp he's like you know what one of the greatest stories I always loved was that story of you playing that girl at the mg2 the MGM that gun in Vegas summit and I was like oh damn I forgot about that shit it was actually was pretty funny it's such a weird pull this girl comes up to me she's like my friend loves you I'm like what it was like it's her right there and I look at the girl and I get I think I'd like talked to her very briefly or something like that I was like a like a two-minute sad or something she loves you she wants to hook up and you have to after after this collar and 40 minutes I'm like uh okay so I'm like whatever I didn't really think much of it so I got all the students laid that night it was pretty crazy so I'm like well I guess it's time for me to get laid so I start texting that girl said you'll meet me at MGM da-da-da-da-da so I actually go to the MGM she meets me down the lobby believe it or not I thought it was some kind of like weird catfishing thing or some prank that was being pulled on me but I actually meet her in the MGM lobby she shows up we actually hang out there hang on the little lobby the little lobby bar there I started making out etc etc so I'm like alright fuck this shit off your room she's like well I can't go up through because my girlfriend who you met is up there she's sleeping I'm like oh alright well let's go back to Venetian I've got a room there and it's a suite it's pretty dope I was like no I can't go back there I'm like which is like I got a good I'm leaving I have to go home and I have to be on the road back to LA by 10:00 in the morning or something like that but yo spine will just be back no problem and she's like no I'm not leaving here Jeff I'm not leaving here Jeff and so what do you think I did now most people will say you fucked her in the bathroom or you fucked her in the ice room it's like look motherfucker I'm old-fashioned okay I don't fuck in like a bathroom I don't fuck in a nice room I'm old-fashioned I fucking a van so but but no so like that's not what I did I didn't fuck her in an ice room or a bathroom what did I do I simply sauntered up to the front desk with her she's like where are we going I'm like right over here i order the food how much for a room like well sir we have a half room available right now I'm you'd have to check out by 10:00 in the morning it's $80 I'm like sold get him put in the room and then we actually went up to the room and she had to be gone by you know in the morning regardless so I slapped down the car boom went right up and got her done right and in fact it was kind of crazy because I had been drinking a little bit and I we were having sex and then it's a certain point I realized I had to pee so I went into the bathroom and you know if I didn't like my pee and then I realized I had only brought one condom so what I did was I attempted to put the old condom pack on my dick and by the way suppose our alert this does not work you cannot put a used condom back on your dick in case you were wondering so moral of the story always bring two condoms that's that's the pro the amateur only brings one the pro brings two but anyway a lot of guys hear that story and they're like wow you know like I wouldn't have even thought of that right and then some other guys hear that story they're like well then you paid for the room I wouldn't pay for the room it's like dude that's another thing if you can't afford a fucking $80 room maybe you should get your life in order where you actually have enough money right like don't be one of these guys who's like so I don't pay for shit I learn games so I could never pay it's like dude know how to like bend the rules sometimes and think outside of the box that's what we're talking about we're talking about creative problem-solving and then that brings me to kind of the last point and and this kind of goes back to the first a lot of guys are like well I live with my parents I can't pull there it's like always be striving to improve your logistics and if that means making more money and again it shouldn't be making more money for the girls you should be making more money for yourself to live the lifestyle you want and then it's just icing on the cake recently I became as I said at the beginning the video a hot tub owner I got myself a hot tub for Christmas it's one of those things that I've been wanting to you for many many years finally bit the bullet and now I'm like holy shit why the fuck didn't I do this before cuz like the polls are insane like it's just like I go out and like the first night we're out talking these girls and about like you know 20 20 minutes and casually mention hot tub and and they're like literally is Statue not not even an exaggeration they're like shit finish your drink Sarah we're going they need to drink now we're going to the hot tub we're going to the hot tub like holy shit is this real like damn Sun and like it's it's fairly consistent everyone wants to go to the day I'm hot tub I was talking about this I'm like oh you gotta get one of these you know you got the mansion you got to get a hot tub huh plush mansion will be off the chain bro and he's like yeah it's funny because most guys is when they start they don't know about game what do they try to work on they try to do logistics first they get a fancy car that they probably can't even afford right on like some lease they work super hard they try to get the job and like impress the girl like buy it and they don't they just end up qualifying themself or they get the hot tub then they like to the girl they don't even have game now mind you again these girls I was talking to when they when they want to go to the hot tub I have attraction pride it's not like I'm just rolling up and being like hey hot tub hot tub that's though that would actually be a pretty funny opener hey hot tub hot tub and the funny thing is that would probably actually work more than you think you know what I mean it's like even the choads that work on logistics first without getting game like again they got a fancy mansion they're like yo back to the mansion back to the hot tub and and they're fucking creeps with no game again it's not gonna be ideal but it's gonna work more than you might think now look at the converse though you get a guy who actually has game and then does a little bit of work on logistics it's like cheating man it's like a fucking cheating so again I'm gonna wrap this up here but let's just to reiterate there's two sides of the logistics coin and one is getting your own logistics down pat the other side of the coin is having that intuition the attunement to what the logistical obstacles are and then making it a logical possibility through creative problems we gotta get the game mechanics down first but then after you get that logistics becomes paramount it really is the ultimate equalizer in game it's the ultimate determinant at the end of the night whether you're gonna go home by yourself and cry masturbating and join shears lubricant or if you're gonna go home for sexy times in a wonderful hot tub so

welcome  Wow pretty big turnout for last fucking day usually a last day that's about half full and you people look a lot more fucked up so I guess you haven't been hitting it hard enough this week speaking of hitting it hard you know I this is the World Summit it's the seventh year I've been here in a row for a 38 year old man I'm pretty convinced I'm going to die here one year I yeah you know I always look forward to this time of year with a mixture of anticipation and deep existential dread you know it's so great to be out with all of you you know the camaraderie wondering how many people I will spit on kick into the pool and or slap raise your hand if I slap you or shove you this week or called you a faggot okay fantastic I sorry I'm in therapy now it's okay so yeah you know it it's kind of interesting because when you go out there and you're I don't you know what you tinted because I always talk to Tyler about this like everyone wants to fuck with me out of the club they never fuck with you they come up to you and they're like it Tyler oh my god they're like let's fuck with Jeffy you know I think I think it's cuz they know that all I fucking lose my shit they're like I want to get punched by Jeffy like it's like a fun experience I'm like how come they don't do it to you he's like well cuz I know that you'll fucking freak out it's like an experience like going to Disneyland get your picture taken with Goofy or something I got I got kicked in the pool by Jeffy yeah yeah so anyway you guys go out last night okay now by the way if I do kick you punch you it means I really love you but um hi I wanted to kind of get away from it take a break last night so I went to be amongst I mean you are my peoples however I went to be amongst my first peoples last night at one of the shittiest ghettoest bars in the entire city of Las Vegas Ellis Island do you know where this is yeah how many you guys have read nine ball fair amount so you may recall the first time I ever came to Vegas I went to Ellis Island they have karaoke you know karaoke those are those are my that's my true peoples and I was kicked out of the bar for crying and rolling around on the floor during the bridge of separate ways now I just wanted to kind of take a break and like you know beast hunts and fucking hoes in the karaoke because when you go to the karaoke bar you would you guys ever do karaoke okay here's the thing about karaoke it's it's not singing for one people think oh I gotta be a good singer it's not singing it's screaming at strangers and getting drunk which are two of my favorite things like that I can combine and that's why I originally did it and then like I found I could fold pickup into I when I started doing pickup because I was like a seven nights a week karaoke guy back in the day and then I found it dovetails nicely with it because here's the thing you can go and by the way I don't know if you know this but I'd say about half of my lays have been from like Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and then the other half weekend but the thing is that's kind of the professional secret if you will is Wednesday fucking night refuge in audacity now usually when people do things that are violating social or ethical mores they they'll try to they'll try to fit in right so try to kind of get it under the radar right me and my crew and that consists of you know there's got Minotaur evil Stifler my crew of retards and sex addicts that tool around in this fucking van in San Francisco you know we do the exact opposite of that we take it so far over the top that there's no way we can't be noticed yet we still get away with it all right so an example of this would be if you were to go to the police and tell them this guy tried to stab me they'll probably go and they'll arrest that guy right however if you go to the cops and say this guy tried to dump me into a vat of hammerhead sharks filled with sulfuric acid they will probably laugh at him and tell him to fuck off another example would be like let's say you're let's say your fuck you nam you go into the food court at the mall and you start picking food off people's plate what are they likely to do punch you in the fucking face and take their pizza back right on the other hand if you run into the food court wearing an Uncle Sam costume with sparklers coming on the Hat with a wheelbarrow screaming put the food in here put the food in here I can't explain now just put it in here and run through there's a pretty good chance they'll just sit there and stun silence and allow you to do it so the key is to be so audacious and how you go about violating it that that no one can even believe that you did it so people tend to have weirdness sensor right and if something it gets past that they kind of just blank it out in their ras I guess you call it it's like so flagrantly unusual they have a hard time accepting it like accepting that it exists and this can be a good source of comedy a lot of the time because you know if you if you get a person who can pull it off they'll be viewed as awesome however if you get a guy who tries something like this and he doesn't pull it off well then they tend to get a very visceral this is reality moment right like this is reality knock-knock reality calling fuck off you're going to jail or you know oftentimes is also a source of a good source of cringe comedy when you watch someone fail at this now one guy who's a master this is my friend evil Jimmy who just got into town I know this because he texted me lube yourself up I'm coming to rape you I remember one year he came here and this is the same year that he broke my finger well first he stabbed me with a corkscrew and then he and then he broke my finger because he he came in and I I don't know we were having a little lover's quarrel and it handy and I threw his guitar out in the hallway by the way this is called booze guitar you get it here at the rock house I'll talk more about this in a second but I threw his guitar his is called Jews guitar but booze guitar and Jews guitar so yeah it's Jewish so I threw his guitar on the thing in the in the hallway so he comes in and he stabs me in the foot with the corkscrew and I'm like bitch you want to get fucking crazy I'll fight your ass naked and so I stripped down and I add salt him with a chair and I attempt to put my balls on his face he then Swartz this move by breaking my fucking finger and the cops come because I'm screaming I'm screaming caught at the top my lunch call the cops I'm gonna kill a faggot right and so the cops come so they come in the right what's going on here and and Jimmy in a fit of like genius he's like he's like oh my god it's so embarrassing he's like we were gonna have a threesome and then once we got the boy up here like he changed his mind and did that and so the cops go from thinking this is like a fight to like oh it's like some gay shit like oh I don't want to I don't want to get in trouble with it with glad or something so they're like oh and they come in they're like what happened I'm like oh my god he's such an asshole and then they're like what do you what do you want to do about this and like I just wanted to apologize and they're like and they're like but like sir we cannot make him apologize I'm like Oh fine fine like if this happens again you're out of the fucking hotel but anyways that's kind of an I digress I remember one year you guys you guys know what outside lands is it's this big festival in San Francisco it's actually happening this weekend one year I had a boot camp at while outside lands was happening and evil Jimmy's like he said yeah man he's like bringing students to the fucking outside lands I'm like well we don't have tickets I think it'll be a bit difficult to get in you know without the tickets he's like now man I just broke and it's simple I'm like oh I'm like oh okay great he's like yeah I found the way to get how do I do it just tell me grin I'll be right there he's out okay you go to this one spot between 25th and 24th on Fulton you crawl through the bushes about half a mile you then you did he's like you then come to a gate you jump you leap over the fence you'll be behind the porta-potties go around the porta-potties there will be a gate there there's a small Asian man checking the tickets you shove him to the ground and run into the crowd as fast as you can I'm like what I'm like I might be able to do that certainly this Indian engineer verge 8 isn't going to be I shove you to the ground and I run into the you know and so this out this whole idea of refuge in audacity it's something to embrace but again your mileage may vary unless you have rock-solid 100% belief in what you are about to do so can we get the lights I'd like to share a bit of karaoke magic tonight from last night if it's not too much trouble [Music]  yeah  [Music]  [Music]  Oh  [Music]  [Music]  [Music] [Applause]  [Music]  [Music] yeah  [Applause]  [Applause]  [Applause] [Music]  [Music] [Applause]  now basically [Applause] after that I can fuck any fat Houma boy yes regional feature new feature of photography

good evening I'm the next idiot of the night speaking with you or am I the first do do I have the honor of being the first idiot of the night to have spoken with you no oh c'est la vie anyway I'm Jeff what's going on Bette and I just roll into it from there okay so and note I I almost I kind of what I'm in the club I think of myself is like almost like this game show host right I think of myself as kind of like elder of the tribe like the guy who's most comfortable in the environment you know good evening not like I mean again I see a lot of guys younger guys especially and they're in the club and they're running around like they look like little puppy dogs like running after a bone like scrambling on the fucking tile floor to fight and get their first get our first bone you know it's like take it slow slow everything down man slow everything down like 50% you know act like you're stone slow it all down you're under moving underwater or something I think a lot of guys when they're new if they have anxiety about doing approaches they have a tendency to rush through the approach Frank something hey how's it going a little right and it's like whoa uh okay in the Gherkin sense they're doing it as a way like if I just rush through it I won't have to feel the nervousness because I can just burn like get it out you know get it over with I'd encourage you to like just against la vida now it good-evening like when you're doing the hand of God how many people are like like the hand of God opener quote-unquote some people love it some people it becomes their absolute favorite because it's so simple it says all the right things about you you know it's just like with that that little knowing smirk there's like there's like a knowing smirk on your face that says there's an inside joke we're sharing and it's you you know that's that's really what the some in my mind that's what the hand of God is saying I feel like a game show host like and you have this aired easy and difference about you because remember the number one rule of game there's a lot of number one rules but the number one rule the game is whatever you feel they feel put yourself in the state you want them to be in so again if you're like hey like permission siggy Tyler calls it permission seeking so if you drop that hand of God it's like do you wanna do you wanna there you looking there right another thing too if they're especially if they're moving let him see you coming you know let him see you coming so many times I see the girls walking by and then the guys like that like the guy waist so she gets right there there's like oh hey and and the girl it's not that she's rejecting it she don't she literally doesn't even hear it she literally doesn't even acknowledge it because it's like her brain doesn't have time to acknowledge someone is addressing me so it's like this she's walking by and it's like you'll see him do like that you'll see him do it there like like that you'll see it I'm sure you some of you have seen it happen to you personally right but they do that like what happened okay okay so you again it's like it's like if you're trying to like shoot a bird or something you got to get it lead-time you need to give her brain time to process the fact that she is being addressed like someone is addressing me who is addressing me I will look to see who was addressing me so that's why we always encourage like open from the front like if you're gonna hand of God get in front of them again in front of if you take one thing out of this entire goddamn talk get in front of the girl in front does not mean 10 degrees off to the oblique angle like no it means in front square up get in front take your time slow movements eat like no permission seeking full expectation like when you're doing where you're dropping the hand of God everything your demeanor should say this it should say you're gonna take it because they always do right that's what you're like you're gonna take it because everyone always does right as opposed to so are you gonna take it cuz no haven't done it before or maybe this will be the time you take it you know like really and again fake it til you make it it's easy to fuck it fake these behaviors right until you actually internalize it and which point it becomes a no-brainer you know so but what does that mean I mean slow put that little like look in the eye and if she doesn't take it all like oh I'll just literally like gesture at my hand I'll be like and I've done this before I sat there for like two fucking minutes I remember this I was in Toronto and I dropped this shit it's like there's big table like at fuckin what does that shit hold in Toronto uh Madison yeah yeah by the way I love that fucking place for I mean it is kind of overrun like in fact you've got a poo infestation if you will but I love that place because it's like a labyrinth I love places that are like labyrinth cuz you can hide from the friends okay these places have more of a tendency like they have a higher what I called ETF quotient different places have at hide ETF quotient than others the more labyrinth like the fucking place is the higher the DTF quotient the more fun the play because in my opinion there's like a continuum of clubs right and on this end of the club you continuum you have clubs that people go to to look cool right most of the clubs in Miami are clubs people go to look cool those do not have a high as high of a DTF quotient as clubs that people go to to have fun like certain clubs you'll go to and people are like wearing a costume and like acting stupid and yay fun like it's more like a fun vibe like yeah a fun party as opposed to we got in here look at my clothes I'm here with all of my friends aren't we cool in the VIP you know that kind of type type of shit so the more like labyrinth like and the more fun it is the higher the DTF I mean again this shouldn't be like with a fuck this club is it fun I'm not gonna get laid I mean you get laid neither but it's just kind of you know something to think about but so I'm at that place and I dropped the hand of God in like this table of people just like looks at me there's like and the girls like and I'm saying  and it's keep city weirder and weirder and weirder and weirder and like everyone's like what the fuck finally I just say to her I'm like look I can just stand here and do this all night just take the fucking hand and she's like and takes my hand and then shakes it and she's like okay fuck off of Mike okay fine but if she took the fucking hand right I will stare there so they take the fucking hand immediate blowout but  yeah I'm very principled in my game and I was talking to Derek about this the other day and I'm making a roundabout point here but uh you know for example like some guys were more principled in their game than others some guys just want to get their fucking dick wet no matter the cost you know for me if a girl does something that like pisses me off or annoys me I'll be like just Smiths get the fuck out of here ho right whereas my friends like evil genie he's like a dog to the fucking core and he'll like I'll be like with girls and the girl picks me off my leg dude you're fucking a jiffy why are you always doing this shit like he's like mother fucker we could have fucked those girls I'm like dude I don't even wanna fuck them she's like what's wrong with you he thinks I'm like insane you know I mean he literally thinks I'm insane for doing this like you know Derek and he's kind of the same thing if the girl says something it was like dismissed you know so different guys fall on different levels of that continuum you know I mean granted evil Jimmy you'll fuck seven girls on a weekend like like he just like hey booboo fuck seven girls this weekend suddenly all these creepy pictures and shit are you literally to set me that shit but uh you know I don't at that point I kind of don't care so I mean everyone's on a different level on that continuum but anyway so again five channels of manual communication eye contact vocal tonality proximity statements of verbal verbal physical escalation and verbal statements of intent now with verbal statements of intent I have a similar sort of ratcheting up system that I do right I start off very innocuous and then I get more and more explicit as time wears on so the first thing I almost always say is you appear a rather fashionable deceiving are you a fashion person I love your look it's hot anyway blah bright again what does their look who the fuck knows it could be their tits it could be their fucking cardigan like whatever you don't know it's very vague very an oculus that but again it puts it out there that I find her aesthetically pleasing I find something about your esthetical your aesthetic that except pleasing so the next thing I'll say I'll be like so tell me let me ask you a question we always hot were you like a nerd then you became hot did you we use the ugly duckling that transmogrified into the fucking beautiful swan is that what's going on here ho or well instead of whole I'll say her name I I used their name a lot by the way I used their name a lot any ones who see me inset knows that I'm like so what's what's this all about Amanda like did it out like I'll use their name and the funny thing is using the name it's one of those things it's not sexy you know what I mean it's not hot and sexy it's not the hot new technique of like rubbing a pistachio on her trying to make her have anaphylactic shock but it's one of those things that you should not overlook it's so powerful my dude it does three things number one it deepens connection when you say to the girl her fucking name like if she tells you her name and then you talk for a while and then like a minute or even like you know a few minutes later you beg look Amanda did it uh they will act as though you are the second coming of Christ like who was there you were there last night right you saw that I dropped that what does she do hold she says holy shit you remembered my name and as though as the what does that tell you no one does so just that little thing will set you apart just that's number one number two it'll allow you to talk over them so if they're saying some fucking Mickey Mouse bullshit I'll be like Heather Heather Heather Heather go like go fucking snap to and they'll shut the fuck up and you can talk over three it helps you remember their fucking name because we've all been busted on that one before,6zMrG2llfp8
so moving right along number eight a pimp has got to remember to pace his conversation sometimes a pimp mind is going so fast thinking of his conversation he doesn't realize he has left the broad behind if you down at a bitch especially a turnout hoe you want to maybe I should talk in that affected ex you want to write up with you when you drop the bomb on her ass about to the pimping okay look I have a bit of a facility with verbal game okay I got that you know the million dollar mouthpiece I can do that now a lot of guys have difficulty with this and and you know many of you I'm sure have struggled with the whole running out of things to say now what is the root cause of running out of things to say trying to impress often though I get so wrapped up in my own shit that I just leave the girl behind I'm just like that and I can I can see it happening to a lot of the time I see like the balloon deflating okay I see the conversational ratio shifting over to me just listening to myself talk okay and if I stop talking at this point she won't even be able to contribute because she's like been shut down you know that this barrage of words says like cowed her into silence so she would even know how to contribute so I got to rein myself in and keep the ratio good you don't want to leave her in the dust with either like you know ideas that are kind of too highfalutin or you know too abstract or talking too fast you know that 90/10 rule of course applies at the beginning of the interaction and that's very important like one of the major things I see with new guys on boot camp is they will go up and they'll have some amazing opener and they'll be like amazing opener and then they just and the girls like yeah bye and they're like what happened the opener was so good I'll tell you what have motherfucker you did a bunt you did a bunt you're like Luke like what the fuck use common fucking sense what do you think is gonna happen you're gonna go up and say like what if some stranger came up to you and said hey man oh yes strange person who came up and said hi and then stood there staring at me like a dumbass well let me engage you in conversation fuck off you have to swing through you know until they hook and of course that's true but by the same token you know you got a downshift once you get to the hook point you down show up to like a 70/30 and then of course a rapport more of a 50/50 number 9 don't be afraid of decisions you have to make when you have a group of hose or confronted with the decision always have a point of view if it's with hose and your point of view might blow the bitch fucker go get another hoe that's why one bitch is too close to none always try to seek deep with hose and make decisions early in game and often and never make them according to how many hoes who have be committed to game abundance though is what gives you that ability to walk without the abundance again one one ho quote unquote is too close to none so you'll be afraid to you'll make decisions that are not going to be solid your judgment will be impaired ok and ironically that willingness to say things that might offend of course not just for the sake of being offensive a lot of guys hear that and they're like oh I'm going to be this crazy polarizing guy like Jeffy for the sake of being offensive that's not what we're doing here I'm just being myself to the hilt ok look man like I said I'm a fucking 37 year old man I look at myself I'm like well looks like this is how it turned out it's probably not going to change anytime soon so if you don't like it I'm sorry have a great night ok so you got to be true to yourself you know and that's extremely attractive I mean shit I've lost countless girls running in my fucking mouth and girls didn't like it oh well you know oh well even worse though than being polarizing for the sake of be polarizing is being offensive to to self-sabotage subconsciously self-sabotaging like I'm going to be offensive so I'll lose the set because you think you're going to lose it anyway and you do it as a way to like make the snub on your own terms quote-unquote okay this is a very insidious thing okay it's like it's what we've talked about being bold versus being confident okay think of like construction workers on the street yelling at girls going buy your baby through the dudes do do they really think it's going to work no they know it's not going to work but then they can say oh like at least the snub was on my own terms so again watch out for that watch out for that number ten don't be a creampuff when you see tears this is the best exorcism in the world especially hoses they can play you with their tears next they'll choose another pimp on your weak ass now I don't see too many tears in my casual interactions okay but what we're talking about here it's like okay I got a friend and he's just getting into game and one thing that's holding him back I mean he's very charismatic guy but one thing that holds him back is he has this paralyzing fear of offending people or of being what he vaguely defines as rude and this isn't like saying fucked up shit this is like oh well they're having a conversation I don't want to interrupt their conversation what do you think I say to this guy I'm like okay motherfucker you don't want to interrupt our conversation what if you had a check for 1 million dollar 1 million dollars with their name on it would you worry about interrupting their goddamn conversation no they might be annoyed at first but then that's going to be replaced by exuberance joy once they realize that they have made you know half a million dollars after taxes so the thing is he sucks because he's got to get over that I that idea of like what he's doing is somehow rude or inconsiderate going for the pole is somehow rude or creepy okay going for escalation is creepy look man I got a story I tell I'm program about the van you guys know about the van the consensual sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of reproduction man when I first got that van a few years back I was fucking tripping I had trouble sleeping at night I was like what the fuck are you doing with your life dude I was like this this is it you're you're a crazy person now you're a crazy person now you have separated from normal society and you drive a fucking that like what are you doing and I had no idea how I was going to play and I remember the first time the first weekend we went out with it I was on bootcamp we met up with these like four Canadian girls from like Seska tune or some shit and and they're all like you know they're there and so I pair off with a little punk rocker making out I'm telling her about the van I'm like yeah we got this rape van this is net and so at the end of the night we're sitting in the back isolated and we got like these beers you know we're drinking beer and I go yo so you know what are you what are you gonna do after this and she says well I thought we'd finish these beers and then it's rape van time and I literally like quickly excuse me she's like yeah rape van time which is all about it this is fucking hilarious and some girls think it's hilarious they love it they're like fuck yeah the like so let's go to the van like I want to see the fucking van like did they they fuckin they think it's a great story to tell their friends and and it's awesome and cool others won't even look at it like there it is like no no they won't even look at it I remember one time I was coming out of the park and me and evil Jimi coming out the park and it's girls walking it's like excuse me you guys um can I ask you a question yeah do you have any weed like weed yeah I think we got some of the car wash like oh I just you know I just got here from New York and I don't have any dope like but would you sell me some like yeah it's cool spin yourself out don't worry about it it's like oh that's so cool and that's we're walking and then she's like do you know why I approach you guys why well you were the only guys that I passed it didn't look like creepy rapists oh oh cool and and as and just as she says this we arrived at the van I go well here's the car and she looks at it and she goes she's like are you like are you fucking kidding me I'm like no key open up and I get I hop in I'm like sitting on this like ottoman that's set up there and she's like on the sidewalk there I'm like yeah come on in she's like like she's shaking her head no no so no big deal was hop out bang you know bam bam bam Batna didn't hook up there that day got her number she was there for a week hooked up there on Tuesday and you know I still hang out with that girl sometimes when I go to New York but the point is this what you think is like creepy now you have no fucking idea what these girls think they might be like the girl next door they might be fucking jenna jameson you have no fucking idea dude okay sasha grey you have no fucking idea so the bottom line is speculation is inadmissible in the court of play okay no speculation find out for yourself okay this is an important one be sure not to pimp pass 1ho trying to get another one this mainly applies when you're down at a fresh hole a lot of niggas take the pimp in as a game this shit is real I saw a lot of pimps have a new broad in the car those paint attention was every word and the fool starts fucking with some hoes on the track catch the hole in your car pimp then once their ass on the track you can fuck with all the hoes bottom line here is a lot of time especially once you start getting to a level of competence your eyes can get too big for your stomach alright and you will acquire so many leads that they start to go stale before you can hit them all how long does it take for a number go stale  three or four days I give it a week I mean dude now obviously this is a rule of thumb I've had situations where I banned a girl you know months later I think the longest I ever went from the time where I met a girl today I have sex that was eight years that this happened recently I uh I take some girl up on boot camp back in the day like when chess club was on bootcamp with me it's like 2004 or something and then I seen her out at the bar like a few months back like April of this year and I just gamed her up and I knew it was her but I didn't say anything and then we went out and then I banned her and then like a couple days later I like dug through my archive like pictures I found a picture of her I was like hey is this you she's like what the fuck I was like yeah I think we met eight years ago and she's like oh I think I remember you I think we made out no actually me and my girlfriend tried to bang you when you ran out of our house and terror but uh you know so but but the bottom line is you really got to you know having more leads does not necessarily lead to more sex because what happens is your bandwidth gets taken up and you cannot effectively focus on anyone okay so you'll you know you'll lose track of different girls you'll get scheduling overlap issues so again what you want is a trickle of leads and then you slowly work them down having said that the trickle of leads is absolutely essential the trickle you got to keep the trickle going that's what makes this possible you understand the trickle is absolutely essential you got to be like a shark always moving you cannot stop to sleep number 12 and you're checking your hole you better keep coming up with shit otherwise be able to distract your mind from the shit you're checking or about keep bringing up shit to keep your thoughts on what you're talking about instead of tripping about what she's thinking about a pimp kicking the shit out of her ass now again obviously we're not kicking the shit out of hoes ass but if I'm having a disagreement or a confrontational interaction or even just say something fucked up I want to I really want to have that shifting sands aspect to my conversation okay sometimes I say something fucked up you'll say something that you think the girl is going to or not even think the girls here you think it's funny but she she doesn't see the humor in it perhaps I tell her I don't know I want to fuck you up ass in the bathroom and I probably wouldn't say that but that she's off the top my head and she's going to get pissed okay I'll sense the shift in the emotional tenor of the interaction you know because I have a high sense of emotional acuity from years of doing this since the shift and then what you want to do there's a there's a structure to this number one step back and that's either give it a little breathing room like either physically and or kind of verbally like kind of way to beat statement of empathy okay so what's this what kind of statement of empathy be oh hey I'm sorry I haven't eaten today I have low blood sugar it's called hypoglycemia I seen on dr. house MD anyway did that and then BAM roll and then roll it under or maybe oh hey I'm sorry you know I never talked to women but I practiced on my sister before I came is it working but once you do that it's like you just anyway did that it's like the game Tetris okay the blocks are coming down and here's the squiggly block which is fuck you up the ass in the bathroom and she's like oh what's what's this what do I do with this but more keep coming more key you have yep she gets decide what to do with it quick and either she's going to fuck off or she's going to accept it and move on oh my god did that positivity move on alright so um 13 learn how to have more than one HOH it is a learned hour to having hos especially more than three most pimps don't how to do it without choosing a main one I never designated menos I was pimped oh it shows me there's no way I'm going to be forced to choose one of them hoes will not like that one now personally I always like having a primary so I don't even necessarily agree with this however you know I've done every conceivable type of approach to game and having you know relationships from having monogamous relationships to having multiplied just non-hierarchical tons of like slut bangs and to having a primary and then a tiered system and and da-da-da-da-da and but back in the day my philosophy like was have like one primary a couple of solid girls and then like the rotating cast and it's kind of come full circle and that's kind of how I run things these days but on an expanded level there's more there's more tears if you will even the smaller version though is an art as rosebud says here you got to choose how to present it to everyone and I'm going to talk about that in the second half of the of the speech but you know I always said after my last relationship that I'd be open you know I'd be completely honest completely open with it and let the chips fall where they may because you know I've done everything from like cheating and that she had fucking sucks man that she had fucking sucks I don't have the energy for just seat number 14 be diplomatic diplomacy is the best policy and always the best choice there isn't any sense in one pimp killing another pimp over some whole shit and we damn sure not boxers we are pimps with plenty of conversation for occasions like that but if necessary a pimp will get busy you know I hear about guys getting in fights and shit I mean look dude I've been doing this 11 years and I've only had a handful of fisticuffs okay just a handful and usually it's because I started because I was wasted and being a jackass all right and why is that because at the end of the day I'm not there to trick or treat with dudes that's not my that's not my goal and anything that doesn't serve my goal of you know finding a girl and hooking up with her is not given air it is not given oxygen it is not indulge I do not play the monkey dance with guys okay you know the monkey dance is monkey dance guy talk shit you talk shit back guy pushes you or get they get your face get very close so like you can feel the spittle on your face then one guy shoves the guy then the other guy shoves the guy then maybe it touches your face and then the next thing you know the looping overhand right and then a brief scuffle and then you are separated by thyroid cases in Blazers and ejected from the venue not cool I'm not there to do that shit okay any bullshit jibber jabber posturing escalation is not given any fucking air in any way ID few as I get the fuck out okay I'll use my conversation to jujitsu those energies away from me how many guys have seen that Tyler video no violence seen that why doesn't that escape even though he's continuing to go after the girl on this fucking goon keeps shoving him why doesn't escalate what is Tyler doing the whole time haha even the goon is like the fuck is this even the goon is laughing okay cuz he's not a bitch he doesn't back down but he doesn't play the monkey dance and that's a very very his luck dude when people fight they're not trying to kill each other you know I'm saying look look when lions fight in the wild they're not trying to kill each other a lion could kill the other line very easily it kills a goddamn deer antelope whatever the fuck they don't kill each other they walk away the minor injuries why cuz that's not the points about dominance and that's why that monkey dance it's the exact same thing every time the words get in the face the pushing the overhand right it's that it's the same thing every time and you do not engage it the violence is not worth it okay I'm not there for that man most fights are nothing but you could get fucked fucked you're in a wheelchair like Frank for the red you're in a wheelchair for the rest of your life or you have the weight of a crushing civil lawsuit on you or you're in jail or dead or the other guy is and you got to live with having killed somebody I mean I get is how often how likely is that to happen not likely but it could happen you know I've read a lot of books about this shit okay cuz I'm fascinated by books by like ex-military guys prison guards ex cops and shit one of my favorites is called that a little what is it called the little black book of violence by Lawrence Kane and Chris Wilder and he they talk about violence in all kinds of different situations and you know again no matter how small or trivial it seems in the moment it has the potential to escalate into a grave situation so it's important to ask yourself is this really worth it is it really worth fighting over and in most cases the answer is going to be no but there's some cases that are going to be yes like if somebody's attacking your family or if some guy wants to like tie you up and take you to a secondary location to rape and torture and murder you okay then yeah but more than likely it's not going to be worth it always approach situation with game keep the game in its proper perspective and if it don't work then da da da da never go out a situation looking for the violence situation isn't necessarily the way to handle it I never carried a pistol my entire 22 years in the streets never got shot at either I employed enough game that I handle all my problems with my conversation I'm proud of that alright when you catch a new hoe check her out don't just accept a bitch you don't know what kind of hangups a new hoe hash it could be a junkie among other things so I was going to check and see what you can see early on whether it's on the first date or subsequent early interactions you're always going to be looking you want to looking for red flags alright you know it could be anything she could just be snippy and snappy she could have like some weird idiosyncratic personality quirk that's like super annoying you know on her phone all the time stuff like that you know you just want to look for this stuff okay or maybe you go in the bar and she like you're you meet Peter for a date and she's like three straight Bourbons please boom boom boom actually that probably a good thing but you know you always want to be looking for this so you can extrapolate it out over the long-term if you see a problem that early well it's likely just the tip of the iceberg okay I don't just sleep with a girl and put her on the team immediately there's a lot of vetting involved okay it's not like really cherishing until after like the third session basically I've seen her three times and we like hooked up three times then it'll skittle kind of shake out you know because you just don't know enough you want to cut her ass off the moment that you see it and well of course what enables this again abundance get more girls 17 you can't bleed blood from a turnip it's not their accepted to move on remember the only thing you're going to bleed from a turnip is turnip juice mmm I had a date the other night and it went very well we got along very very well but then at the end of the day cheated she wouldn't even kiss me now look if she won't have sex with me on the first date that's fine that's totally fine I get it okay that's great whatever different people have different ways of approaching this but if she won't even kiss me it's like fuck off dude really come on what are you doing here what is this but it was as 1860's like Dutch Pennsylvania Dutch country or some shit like fuck off if she won't even make out blood from a turnip and there's many other red such red flags but again it's best that she leaves now okay like I had another girl stay just like she's like but if I have sex with you tonight then I know I'll never see you again I'm like well you're never going to see me again either way so you might as well have sex he'll be back you're never gonna see me again what's the difference fugitive patient confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion,7P4gpXRQqQE
as you can see I'm also wearing camouflage cargo shorts which is a little-known detail for history as far as actually did wear that can't be happening sir but everyone can be a Spartan um oh yeah so it was up um a lot of familiar faces here uh feedback see a lot of you guys are are you guys going out tonight yeah you are you gonna rest up yeah because the thing is look on Tyler hey hey guys it's Tyler sonorous name so um you know what's interesting because like I see a lot of guys out I was out last weekend I did see some guys out with no costume oh okay and would you see that guy you don't want to be that guy do you know what I mean by that you don't want to be the guy who isn't having fun at the party who isn't no matter what the party is if it's Halloween if it's like some festival where everyone wears like you know banana on their head you don't wanna be the guy without the fucking banana and in fact you want to take shit as crazy as possible now what is this all tie into this all ties into the concept of bringing value okay that's a buzzword that we've heard an rst you know you that's been Vande bandied about quite a bit um what does she guys what's bringing value me anyone who's well-versed in these concepts what does it mean to you yeah it means not a spectacle we'll just to come to UC San the corner basically just because if you want someone to provide IAT when we want to fly to Canadian Valley sure that's yeah that's that's good it does not mean like there's nothing I was going to say providing emotions rather than okay excellent also correct doesn't mean the girl you're talking to is having more fun now that you're talking to her than before all of those all of those are correct okay and what this means essentially is this you want to look at all of your interactions with the following lens when I go up am i a adding energy to the interaction or MIB trying to weasel my way into the girls party like weasel my way into the fun if you're getting those kind of reactions on a consistent basis you're not cooking most likely what you're doing is you're trying to weasel your way into the girl's party now again this ties back to this point of life not being the guy at the party who's not having fun think about this like um I have a friend you guys have heard of this guy evil Stifler okay this guy I learned a lot about this guy from just really just like having the most fun at the party of anyone there okay and at Halloween this guy it's funny because he always comes up with these crazy like wild up like bizarre almost Halloween costume ideas for example this year he was driving to the airport this morning and he said up I'm like yo so what do you mean tonight good he's like I'm a I'm a cat video producer yeah Hideo pretty what was that said well I found I was at the thrift store picking up house oh he likes our anniversary's like ain't no pussy better than vintage pussy site is that the first I'll fucking say typos and I found the tape of cat adventures that you put on your VCR when you leave your house your cap and watch TV  alright lose it then I got this phone it's like an old-school handheld phone and I plugged it into that box okay is that can I wear a cat the channels the fuck is that then I got to go the safe do you have a cat if they say yeah I go wish cap your cats at home right now you need to watch cat adventures I can help you produce a video and then I put the I put the phone to their ear and it's a cat meow well you're probably not going to run it to anyone else at the same costume the thing is like it doesn't even make sense the thing is he thinks it's like hilarious cat cat pajamas cat video producer they took the fun right and you know he always does kind of wit this kind of weird shit when he goes up he's so enthusiastic about you so bought into it that everyone just kind of like dude this guy's awesome right he's adding to the fund it's supposed to leeching from work needing them to approve of them having fun because a lot of times that's the main thing I notice on bootcamp that's holding guys back they don't they don't want to have the only know how to have fun in the club I'm like I'll say ghoster have you ever had fun before yes do you know how to have fun work this okay have fun right now well they simply can't do it or especially in the club advisor really lock up now why do people not wire people at first to have a person having fun in the club socially condition they don't they don't want to look stupid there you go they don't want to look stupid so on bootcamp we will frequently do an exercise that we call the clown man dance party okay and this is for guys who have difficulty having fun the club will take them onto the dance floor and we'll form this like dance circle you know like girls have the damn circle where they like for all their thumbs it down in the middle of the floor and then it's damn right we do the same shit except of dudes go away dances are golf  but with our guys and again well I just blew it be the middle of different good drugs drugs will use for like 10 to 15 minutes and 15 minutes and what will suck out all the time but what sometimes happens is you'll get this like we're group of people trying like what kind of form around you and they won't up for it like girls they want to approach you but they'll kind of just get really and they'll start doing like approach invitation type behaviors you know trying to try to bait you into opening them because they see that's where the energy is that's where the fun is I want to be part of that all right so you want to take it is over the top as you possibly can I go up the asshole of yourself consciousness and come out the mouth even rainbows I came out um you know another people stiffer costume that was pretty pretty insane he he had a way one time he had you guys know beta breakers is this foot raised tempest or everyone dressed up it's like it's like Halloween in June DS and you know it's like heavily patrolled by cops elongational drinking on the street so anyway last year old evil Jimmy he comes out with he's got a speedo on and he's got these balls around his neck like these furry balls like in a necklace that he's tied to this giant lions head and it's like the Lions head is hanging on his dick okay all right cool whatever that is item because I can but look at this and then out of like this we call some tube and he's like taste it and he's like he's like installed camel bags into the head things like this one my food so get that spot can pineapple juice taste this one I've always liked that shot in it he's not gonna Philippines they call that thunder in life and then I'm like what's that thing coming out the back it's like oh this and you like put some shit out and you like you he puts a balloon nitrous no seeds you'll see any little household thing around I was like how can I make you some weird shit to life so I beg hose no doubt seen the video of us with those those donkeys right at the SantaCon video we have this dog you know he saw that shit on the street he literally was walking down the street he saw a pile of things that were being put out for like the goodwill and his child's toy was among it he's like I mean most people to see that be like oh you know child's toy water he's like oh I could put suspenders on that and a hose on the street with it he's my taste until users unlike society - beijos Oh two years ago we went to this big warehouse party for Halloween and we had purchased this like these child's play hunts when was like Thomas the Tank Engine you know I take a little pop up like wireframe canvas play Hut it looks like comments to Tank Engine and it we got another one they look like a school bus and so you know they're about yay big yay hi and and he so he put he cut a hole in the mesh top puts it over his head and puts arm holes out the windows and I was walking around he's a school bus and what he would do is he'd see a girl that he'd like in fact as we roll up to the is crazy because as you roll up to the event we're waiting a line of suburbs most oh that's a great costume prevent anyone from getting near you any would like any time during the night that's a great idea it's like oh yeah Trapster in the fucking bus starts making out with the whole shit I stand corrected a hole in the front so he would just go boom now they're trapped in that's right taken out so he's doing this throughout the night addendum at a certain point of life you don't make it make it make out what have you he's on the dance floor and he traps earlier if they started making out he simply puts it down and he gets on the ground and he started making out inside and they start fucking inside of this thing on the bucket dances yeah Brandon it's not like the clubs have a warehouse party but still it's like on the flex I inside the fucking venue and then these girls come up to Mike that's going out in here this looks fun and he's like we're fucking them I cut out and then they crawl into a little Playhouse gonna be like oh my god they are  to girls at night so like another one like off by the disabled barrier so shit so I'm really the point of that is this you know regardless of what party even if it's Halloween or just an average Thursday night you really want to like think outside the box and how you can have fun take outside the box on how you can bring the party how how you can make your cell cap on don't I think I think about bringing that you bring the party and they think that it's about the girl it's not it's about you and fear confusion confusion confusion confusion and freesia and three,7Ugu3S-fGNM
yo yo yo what up this your proverbial boy Jeffy I'm here at the fucking mall in Copenhagen and my boy Max he just finished launching his new product fearless the approach anxiety Buster phenomenal program very successful launch and you may have noticed over the course of the past couple of weeks if you're involved with the RC inner circle groups that your Facebook feed has been filled with dudes lying on the ground and yelling in fact many people were expressing a little frustration with this little annoyance and you figured now that fearless has been launched things are going to get back to normal well if that's what you thought you thought wrong because I've cleaned up with max to create a new challenge called the fearless resonator challenge a comfort zone challenge combined with a vocal projection challenge so you're not gonna have to lie on the ground this time and get dirty or anything like that you are going to have to yell in public of course so go to a public place but resonator is all about powerful vocal projection but it's also about healthy vocal projection so what you're going to do you can go to a public place you're going to project at the top of your lungs but in a healthy way now what does this mean allow me to explain most people when they think about projecting their voice they've heard that old conventional wisdom project from the diaphragm so what they think it means they're pushing air right they're actually pushing air now this will actually create a loud sound but the problem with this is it's not going to be a pleasant sound it's not going to be an attractive sound is going to be very like jarring and abrupt almost and secondly it's not going to be healthy long term because that pushing of air that's actually what causes laryngitis was causing the horse at the end of the night so we want to teach you how to do it in a healthy way that's going to allow you to do it long term as well as the pleasant and everything in yadda yadda yadda so how do you do this well let me explain instead of pushing your ear you want to think of actually pinching the Voicebox so around your voice box your larynx or in your trachea there if right right below the epiglottis is what's called the aryepiglottic sphincter haha and it's um it's a ring of muscle that actually can contract and what this will do it's like a hose for voice the noise comes out like a hose so if you just turn it on turn the hose on water comes out and goes like that but if you were to pinch that hose now it has pressure but now it'll project like a laser and this is actually related something called ring which is why opera singers can project their voice in you know an amphitheater or over allowed Orchestra so here's what you're going to do you're going to protect your voice in a nice pleasing tone and you're going to do it not by pushing air but from pinching okay so I guess I'm to do it right here and here we go oh  so just do that and what you're going to get is entered in raffle for three guys I'm going to random to select and they're actually going to win the resonator program for free so go outside hit it up and by the way if you're pushing your air we are going to know so don't push that air post them up on the inner circle groups and I'll see you next time on my channel Jordan sighs all right good night do some identify to get on my eyes  [Music],7tLI5hQuWfI

hey what's up - Jeffy I'm coming at you today from told molas Bay aka Tomales Bay Northern California I'm here at the what does this place call it's called the the Marshall Store this shot up here taking a quick little break from the intensive work that I've been doing on the program vacay the online game program coming up in October and it's interesting because getting back into that the process of actually producing work it's been you know a couple years frankly since I've really embarked on a very labor intensive project and most the time a past couple of years I've just spent doing bootcamp on the weekends and then lounging about going to the gym and getting into sundry troubles during the week but not really doing much else just kind of in a very sort of almost like a nine-to-five kind of job type scenario right and so anyway so recently getting back into at this deadline now for this program and it's coming to kind of in October it's 120 days got to get cracking on that shader also gonna be you know you're gonna come up short and the last big project I did was obviously the the books 9-ball yeah be shown I've every one I didn't I'm bald I would sit there and it took me ten hours of sitting in bed like basically typing 10-hour days Monday through Friday for eight months to get that done and you know it's funny because I did it I dedicated that book to my family when in fact I probably should have dedicated it to adderall because that's that's what made it possible but but in any case I got no adderall now I'm just you know I'm an old man now so just stick to coffee things things grown from the green earth although I'm I'm not sure adderall isn't grown from the green earth I'm sure you could find some sort of plant derivative alkaloid what-have-you but anyway so getting back into it has been kind of rough and in fact I started on the project last year in like January 2013 but and I had gotten a significant amount of it done and then what happened is I had a hard drive crash I had one of the original like first-generation solid-state drives and it had some flaw where it was just blank and like everything on it gone and this is before I was like using cloud computing for backup like a smart person back your shit up and so I lost all that and so it was really really difficult for me to even motivate to get started on this thing again you know I just was like oh god I did all that work and now I can't even get back into it and I think a lot of guys could feel the same way when let's say for example they're trying to get back into doing a cold approach pick up earth and a nice name for that matter if for example you had a you had a girlfriend like and this happens all the time and I always tell people this you know after boot camp what happens a lot of times the guy will go out after boot cabin he's on a roll he's got momentum and then he'll go out and pull some girl home and then that becomes his girlfriend like immediately with a week of the program right and you know fantastic but whatever you know now a year and a half later this guy comes on the program again and I'm like oh great great to see you back alright ready to take to the next level huh alright let's do this shit boom when we go out to the field then he fucking sucks and I'm like why do you suck didn't you take program before he's like oh yes but a week after the program I got a girlfriend and then I got with the girlfriend and now we broke up and now I'm back to square one and it can be difficult for the guy to even want to get back into it because he felt he had like built some little little thing up and then and then it was just the carpet pulled out from under him you know so I always tell people like look after a bootcamp you should take six months of like just just play the field and like get your skills down because your when you do get to it relationship you're not coming at it from a place of scarcity right you're coming out from a place of abundance so you know go in a weird codependent behaviors and shit like that but in any case I mean yeah I mean if I'm really tending to my own self-interest yeah get a girlfriend immediately after the fucking program see in two years buddy caching right so but yeah for a lot of those guys it's it's difficult like now that the girlfriends gone they're like well shit you know now I'm gonna have to go back in and throw myself into that all over again but the thing is you just fucking start you know if you have been out of the gym for a while yeah just fucking start but then here's another caveat with that okay you know you know you trust the process you know what's gonna happen you because you've done it before but at the same token it's very easy for your ego to get a hold of you and you'd think that you're still able and performing at the level that you were able to perform that before you took the break right so for example with me you know getting back into you know creating this program and everything it's the act of sitting down there in front of the computer having to like organize things in my videos and it's so unwieldy and it seems it's much more technically difficult than something like say the Jeffy show for that matter where you're just standing up there talking there's all these workflows it's quite complicated and I can't even do four hours and shouldn't like work is hard like I can't even do four hours it hurts my brain right and then you're trying to relax after you're like out with your friends or some girls over you can't even really relax because you're you're just like constantly thinking about the fucking product like even though you're like because you're so wound up in it and that's like where your little hamster wheels going and they kind of fucking sucks and I was talking about this and he's like well you know again it's just like going back to it's like you said it's just like going back to the gym you have to understand if you haven't been to the gym in a year you're not gonna be able to bench two plates anymore you know so don't go into it thinking you're gonna be able to perform at the same work capacity that you used to be able to like sitting there for ten hours a day in bed hammering out the pros you know month in and month out like eventually I'll get back there but right now taking a little bit at a time you know a couple hours at a time turn off the social media sit there in front of your fucking computer and do it and you build up the the work capacity to the level that you had before so again any skill you're trying to get back into whether it's again just just busting your balls working or you know going back to the gym or even getting back in a pickup after a hiatus you have to understand and accept that you're not gonna be able to perform at that level again right off the bat you will get there much more quickly than you did initially when you're first learning the skill or whatever because you have you know that physiological kinesthetic memory what have you muscle memory so to speak and those neural pathways have largely already been ingrained they've just faded a little bit maybe got a little overgrown so you go in there and clean shit up rebuild the pathways have faith that'll come and get her done so to speak so anyway bout to head back into the city this has been Jeffy coming at you from Tomales Bay California and I'll see you next time,8GpoljZWPhE
I've read every book about pimping imaginable now obviously what we do is different okay you know we just want to get laid and pimps actual pimps think that that's like sucker shit all right they probably would like to look down on us as chumps however you know a lot of the strategies and attitudes that they employ can be very easily transferred what we do and one of my favorites in the pimp ology genre is the American pimp by the guy who goes by the name of rosebud with two DS for a double dose of dat pimping as he says or whatever the fuck you want it to mean quote and this is some guy he is from Northern California he started out he was like a you know a student with good grades as a kid but he was fascinated with pimp early and so he started moving around America and learning everything he could about the pimp game and his book is about the choices that one has to make in order to excel at that lifestyle and you know the mental toughness that he had to develop to really get to the highest levels of the pimp game who strong coffee um so at the very beginning of his book he talks about the 27 rules of pimping which he cultivated over his career which he started he got the idea to form these at a pimp court in Oakland and what happened was he got peeled he got knocked which means another pimp took one of his bitches and he took issue with how it was done so a pimp court was convened and they to rule on the matter and he says that um it was in that at that moment he learned that he really needed to have to think on his feet and he learned the importance of principles and these are the principles that he cultivated that guided him throughout his career his like 20 you know two decade career of pimping okay so we're going to go through these one by one now the first rule of pimp pre is be cold now these are actually rose buds actual notes here and then I'll elaborate on on them as we go so be called a master pimp must have the ability to be as cold as necessary he must be able to go from being iced to being an iceberg you dig now I'm sure that you guys have all heard about beat you know iciness in our SD a lot of guys talk about that Owen talks about being I see Brad talks about having this game like it's like petrified wood okay and basically what this means that you are unaffected by the vicissitudes of the environment okay and basically you know whatever happens in the field your emotional state does not fluctuate you don't get flummoxed now I remember years ago you know I've been doing the ship for 11 years I'm ever back in like 2003 I remember very distinctly the first time I like a mug dag I like some big dude in the club and I went up to him and I said one of the classics stupid like cheesy lines from back today I'm like hey bro I love your shirt I have one just like that in high school I bet you get all the girls with that huh and I said it like that but inside I was like holy shit holy shit what the fuck am i doing is he going to punch me in the fucking face right it wasn't even that really it was just kind of more like I'm being rude to someone this is fucked up and I remember being like very shaken by that but oddly enough it worked and I was like oh fuck right flash-forward ten years later and basically I'm just kind of like this Terminator like this emotionless cyborg badass who goes through my day like not like I'd like with dead shark eyes as I be a dickhead to people in the club but you know now I've been tempered in the game I don't lose my cool unless it's a calculated move so you might ask yourself how do I cultivate this quality of so called iciness well you know you've got to expose yourself to it that's really the bottom line you know exposure is going to be there's not really too many shortcuts to be that you can fake it till you make it obviously but you you expose yourself to it now why is this so valuable what you see as men we are attracted to visual stimuli huge boobs that's what I enjoy large boobs in my face women however tend to typically we'll look in your eyes when you approach them they will look in your eyes and what are they looking for  anyone they're looking for that that I don't give a shit about the outcome of this right I'm not not like I need this to work I hope you stay and keep talking to me I really need this to work they're looking for a guy who doesn't give a fuck about the outcome because again what does that sub communicate  abundance oh no what's what is abundance mean this dude can go call fucking ten girls right now to come suck his dick now this kind of confused me for a while because it doesn't really make sense why would a girl want some dude who's like fucking all these bitches some ho-bag well it's the same reason a brand works okay if you go down to Walgreens here and you want to get a cola and you have oh here is coca-cola and here is Walgreens brand Cola okay I know what this is like this is people like this this is good this shit I don't know what the fuck that is okay so I'm going to reach for Coke it absolves them of responsibility of having to do research okay it's a shortcut it's basically an indicator of value yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda okay so this is why you want to be I see no matter what happens my toes keep tapping now moving on to the second one a pimp has got to be able to take any information in hand if a pimp doesn't start learning from the beginning he's in for a long hard haul to the bottom of the heap a real master pimp or a potential master loves the challenge that new thoughts and new game brings one thing I always say to students is don't think about how you would like things to work look at how they actually work alright because a lot of guys get into the game and they got like these romanticized notions of how it should be you know one of my least favorite types of student I mean actually all of my favorite students are my favorites but one of my least favorite types of student is the guy who thinks the game should be beautiful okay well the game is beautiful kind of in the same way that like a or thread on 4chan is beautiful maybe you know it can be messy right so you don't want to look at like oh you know I just want to go up and have these deep connections and I want the girl to really like me for me and not to have to be a jerk and this kind of stuff you know or any number of that's just one example obviously there are many other like a lot of guys who were really immersed in theory who are steeped in theory they come on the bootcamp I've I've been reading and you know and watching videos for five years and I finally decided to take a bootcamp and I haven't done any approaches that's I go brother here we go I'm going to have to unwire a lot of bad habits or not even habits rather but like a lot of misconceptions and for these guys it's interesting because a lot of times these guys get calcified into theory and it's very difficult because even on debrief I might say things like okay so let's talk about that one set yada yada yada and they'll be like but the theory says this though and I'll be like well yes but remember when I did this and how and how it she responded he'll still just be like but but to the theory the theory I'm like all right and they simply can't accept this even in the face of the facts and this is the type of guy who will go out night after night week after week year after year banging his head against the wall doing the same shit and not getting the results so you really have to open your mind to look at how things actually function look at the empirical evidence that you're gathering from your interactions and again I would say you got to put yourself on the cross and really be honest about where you're fucking up that's the guy who's going to get better okay so hmm number three a pimp has to be able to make sense out of nonsense the pimp can't make sense out of something that's jumped off wrong and make that shit right he's going to lose a lot of hoes because shit in the game don't always happen by the book a master pimp has to be able to ad-lib at any time there is a perfect set theoretically okay you open I opened with a self-amusing opener to draw her into my reality I blather at her for you know several moments two minutes until I reach the social hook point at which point I start layering in statements of intent gently and then ramping up like from say you appear rather fashionable this evening I love your look it's hot and then up to I want to Eskimo kiss your pussy I like to suck my own dick at the farmers market for money let's chick ask me that it's like what do you do I'm like I suck my own dick at the farmers market on Saturdays for money I don't have a booth set up it's like out front it's like busking it's really fulfilling so but anyway so so I start layering that and then I started layering my physicality I get that I get a kiss and then I back off and I go into a rocking with rapport and now I go for rapport singing questions finding out who she's here with where she's staying what she's doing later I do some pointless leading to build additional comfort and I circumnavigate the logistical obstacles pull her back and then I deal with the LMR and then I get it in and this culminates and me going crew and ejaculating making a noise that sounds like Chewbacca getting a cold thermometer shoved up his ass as my roommates characterize it I'm like in many ways the worst fucking roommate because it's like every fucking night  like I had a new roommate move in recently and this chick like on the first like before she you know I had the first interview then she came over like sign the papers and she had I'm like I'm like so before we sign this I gotta like I gotta let you know something she's like huh I'm like yeah I kind of didn't want to say on the first thing it's kind of weird and creepy but I have a lot of sex and she's like what the fuck it's like what hear me and I'm like just like a lot of fucking sites and then she goes uh well so to me and my boyfriend we might give you a run for your money it's like oh alright hi-five she hasn't uh but uh but you know so again so it's there so anyway long story short there is that perfect set but then sometimes you get the fucking lightning strike you know you just go up and there's that insane like connection right off the bat and you just fuck it you have a five minute Pole and so basically um you know I just anchor to the van a lot of times guys not a lot times but I've seen this before like guys who are not able to see the lightning strike and then they'll back off and because it doesn't conform to the the model alright and this is kind of similar to the previous one in that in that regard you know and they'll try to run the solid game and they'll fuck it up or you know and consequently they might end up just spinning their wheels spinning their fucking wheels so sometimes on the other hand I don't make out with the girl at all I pull her without even making out with her kissing her at all because she's not comfortable with that and I see that if I do that it's going to fuck shit up so you know I remember that happened you know it happens all the time but I remember having pretty recently the girl just she wouldn't make out whatever barely even touch but as soon as we got back to my house it was just like alright let's do it time to fuck cut the shit irrelevant she's saying that shit to me like the female me right so you know she turns into like some succubus trying to take my soul out through my dick or something and of course these are these are just broad examples I mean sometimes you might just make an innocuous comment that does that seems harmless and the bitch freaks the fuck out and you're like what why would you freak out about that and you got again that's when you got to be able to think on your feet and get created an ad love you're way out of it you know and one thing that can help with this is of course it with experience you really ingrain those invisible threads you know I mean you guys are familiar with that concept of invisible threads well invisible threads it's the idea that in any given social interaction there are an infinite number of things that people could say however within that infinite range of things people could say there's a finite rain of things that they typically do now that finite range is pretty big but over years and years and years you'll hear the same fucking things over and over you know if I say this she's probably going to say this this this or this and for each one of those I have a response or several each one imparting a different emotional tenor to the interaction and I'll be able to pick and choose you know how I wanted how I want to sculpt the emotional tenor and then for each of those she'll have five responses to that and it's like the tree just goes down okay and you'll learn these um you know you learned these and you'll grain them the more and more you go out and the ultimate like result of this is that at the end of the day these bitches can't say shit to me because they have no idea what the fuck is going to come out of my mouth next it's probably going to be a better answer you know back in the day I forget who said I think mounted gave a D like always have the better answer it's like like one of those video games where you're like interacting with the non-player character and you can say this this or this and you know and it's like it trees out like it'll affect the outcome it's almost how I see it in real time when I'm talking these girls so basically it gives you a lot of maneuverability in said do you want to make it more confrontational do you need to take it back from the brink do you want to take it more romantic etc etc etc so basically you got to always be on your feet always be playing get here to ABC's it's like a BP always be playing alright now moving along number four when you don't see those hoes don't panic I know it feels damn good to ride by and see your crew hoes but the bitches must get busy at some point so they won't be there just because you rolled by if they are the hoes are half-stepping about your paper when you show up in the hoes aren't there go shoot some pool or some and wait for those bitches to get back but they better have some paper when they do show up we're not checking up on our hoes on the street okay however but this applies to when you're say like in the phone game realm when you're texting them and you know guys oftentimes I see somebody's they get too anxious when the girl doesn't like respond immediately they get super anxious you know personally for me if a girl doesn't respond to me within a couple hours and I'm trying to set up a date for that night which I only try to set up dates for that night why do you think that is because otherwise I find a lot of flakiness if I do set up a date tentatively for later in the week that morning that treated as though I just got to start from scratch but but anyway I'll just put her to the side not not because I'm being a dick or because I'm butthurt but because it's first come first serve hos I had a friend though my old assistant Gary I remember one time he came to me and he's like chief can you take a look at this text um I think I fucked up this girl like she's not responding to my call my text so okay I look at it looks alright I'm like what the fuck and then I look at like the time that he sent the text I'm like wait a minute an hour and a half ago really dude that's how long it takes for you to arrive at the conclusion that you suck in the bitch hates you an hour and a fucking half are you fucking retarded you wait on it and you don't send more shit I have a theory that girls will wait to respond to your text to see if you send more bullshit like digging yourself into a hole of neediness it's like a test I don't know this for real but you know maybe you guys go out and confirm it but again I think they sit there let's say if you gonna send some butthurt bullshit like why didn't you spend I knew you didn't like me or some you know fucking such nonsense and you know look the thing is look at the fucking reality here for many guys this isn't about sex okay this shit is about what it's about ego it's about ego they want the love they want the validation they want the acceptance so for me it's always been about sex plain and simple of course egos always gonna creep in but first and foremost it's been about getting my dick wet so look you can end with your ego you that you assume the world revolves around you it revolves around me the heliocentric universe and I'm the Sun look man people have lives she's probably at the fucking DMV alright maybe she's at the fucking gym make sure that work don't jump too inclusions okay so I'll wait wait wait couple hours if she does respond I'll just move in the next girl you know and I'll just hit her up in a couple days like nothing happened yo what's up did too did an anecdote meet up okay now of course if she doesn't respond then like three or two or three tight like after the third time maybe that's like the most I'll go I'll just Kyle take her off the board okay and I I cut to the bone real quick and you know like I work my numbers to the bone but it doesn't take long to get to that bone all right why because I have a constant trickle of leads coming in so if she's not going to get with the fucking program c'est la vie and I shed a little tear and I say I give her a little blessing and you know and and then she's gone so again you know less is more in the text game I wanted I'm really concise a lot sometimes I will banter back and forth if I'm safely and I want to keep it warm stuff like that but that whole idea of being concise and non media my Texan Russia has really been instilled into me by experience so number five don't be overly excited about getting your paper from your ho master pimp has to maintain his composure at all times the sooner you realize those are supposed to pay you the sooner they will accept it as their destiny don't act grateful to your ho for paying you a lot of times especially if the girl is really hot you might get like all excited about it you know you're like oh shit this chick is really hot whoo right and a lot of times if I'm fucking like an exceptionally hot girl I found that I would I would try to like prolong the fucking I'd be like whoa it's so good I just want to keep fucking here because I might not be able to fuck her again okay now what is the sub communication they're like I'm doing Tantra and shit like so I sort of last longer what's the sub communication I don't fuck girls as hot as you usually makes sense so you might even want to go so far as to like Poland Alex treasure and then bust in five seconds okay as like a tactic to show her that you don't give a fuck now honestly um you know hey that's just what I've heard man that's just what I've heard so you can act aloof in this situation if you remember to pull it off in the moment but at the same time the real I always say we don't want to address symptoms we want to address root causes okay so again we don't to treat the symptom we want to treat the root cause so what's the root cause here up your fucking game you know don't get blase about it but the end of the day the secret to fixing this particular issue is abundance okay now how do we how do we build abundance well that's one of those chicken or the egg type questions but again as so much of this game you've got to pay your fucking dues you know you have to pay your motherfucking dues challenge yourself challenge yourself to step to those kind of girls that you would typically be all super excited about having sex and you've stepped them on principle okay years ago Tyler was like he called vated principle where he's like if I see a girl in the club and I'm intimidated by her in any way I must approach I must approach on principle now this is one of those things that's easy to say like yeah man whenever I see the girl that I'm intimidated about ice kept to her hard to do in the moment okay difficult to do in the moment but again really the outcomes are relevant because if you think about it personally for me at least I don't remember blowouts and I've said this many time I don't remember blowouts but I do remember not taking action you know if I remember sets from fucking eight years ago where I didn't take action I can't remember a single fucking blowout for the last month though and I'm sure there have been plenty okay so number six a pimps got to remember what he says to a hoe because the hoe will try to use it against you in the end a master pimp West remember every promise he makes to his crew of hoes must remember what his subject on our position on the subject is and don't change it for any hoe you shouldn't ever say anything now that'll trap you in the future ultimately what this means you got to be true to yourself I don't want to be attempting to micromanage other people's perceptions of you or pandering to what you think they might like now how many guys in here do like online game I remember back in the day how's that battery situation I don't like holding this feels like I'm holding a dick I mean I'm used to hit but so anyway um right right so long story short I when I first had mid like my online profile I decided to make it like you know what would a girl like what what kind of girl what would a girl what kind of guy would a girl like to go out with all right and so I structured it that way now I would get a lot of girls to meet up but then a lot of times they would just wouldn't fuck so then basically what I did I recraft my profile to just be me and what is me it's kind of obnoxious its kind of out there it's kind of strange abnormal if you will on kind of weird so the thing is I would get less responses but I get more girls actually fucking on the dates cuz let's face it any girl that's going to go out with general Dirar has pretty much already made her fucking decision and it's just on me to not fuck it up alright but the thing is look many guys have a different style and that's up to you but you got to be true to yourself like for example Julianne one can say this guy panders crazy cuz get what I love about Julien's game he's like water okay he will find the crack you know he will felt like he's picking on the floor for crack now he will he will find he will cycle through everything until he finds that one crack in the armor and he will go through it you know but at the same time Julianne also has some very strong principles of zone that he will not abandon okay so most guys I know in the game who are good they stick to their guns now number seven a pimp has got to see through muddy water and orders spot dry land sometimes shits extremely thick from problems the hoes have a master pimp has to see past all the bullshit coming at them and spot the avenue out of the problem and still get paid a lot of times a pole is going to be messy it's not going to be simple it's going to be messy I remember recently I had this girl and I pull her from the club and she's like no I can't

"- Yo, yo, yo, what up? This is your proverbial boy, Jeffy, and my proverbial nephew. - Max. - And today we're gonna talk about something that's rather controversial, or I guess it's not so controversial anymore, but it's this concept called NoFap. Now, what is NoFap? Well, back in the day we called it masturbation, we called it jacking off. And, you know, if you've watched my stuff, in the past, you've probably heard me kind of talk about NoFap derisively in a lot of ways, like, this shit's ridiculous, who the fuck would need to do this? It's kinda stupid. And, in recent times, my perspective has changed on this, for a couple of reasons. Now, first off, why did I think NoFap was stupid back in the day? Well, 'cause I grew up and, you know, in the 70s and 80s, okay, I was born in 1976, okay, I'm a Capricorn, but, back in my day, you did not have easy access to like massive amounts of internet pornography. - I forgot about that dude. - Right. Like back in my day, when I was, you know, in puberty age, if you wanted to masturbate to porn you would literally have to find like the Sears catalog and turn to like the bras page. I'm not even kidding you. This is what you would have to do. Or hopefully you could like find your dad's porn stash. And like you know, you would be like digging through a box of keys to get into the locked shed or whatever the fuck, and like or you knew a friend that had some and you'd like pass it around or something. - Exactly. I remember that when I was like very young just before I was just 10 years old, I would hang out at my friend's place. And we'd just gather like, cause I'm European right, even though you're my uncle I ended up being European. There would be like a lingerie ad in the newspaper. We would like cut it out and like keep it. And he had a little box. - You'd make like a collage. - Yeah. - You'd literally like be like... - Yeah literally. That was what we did. - Like you're like scrapbooking. You're like cutting out these lingerie pictures from fucking JCPenney catalog and shit. - Yeah. - And pasting it onto like a cardboard, like a vision board. - Yeah, yeah. - Except it's not a vision board. It's a jizzum board. - Jizzum board. - It's not a vision board. It's a jizzum board. - Anyways, real quick. Before we're gonna get into this. Look, Jeff and I we've been traveling the world now. We've been teaching this shit for a very, very long time. - Yeah. 16 years in my case. A long time in his case. - Yeah we've done this all over the fucking world and this video right here as you can probably tell by now this is not some watered down, like the NoFap benefits from some fucking chode who doesn't go out. - Yeah, exactly. Like this is the real deal. We've been going out. We've been doing this stuff and we've experimented with this stuff at length. Everything we talk about. It's practical, actionable advice so if you like that kind of stuff please take a minute, like and subscribe. Kaching. - Underneath this video. - That little bell. Those little buttons. Smash those fucking buttons et cetera, et cetera. But in any case back to the main point at hand, like I said. So obviously today kids aren't jacking off with JCPenney catalog but now they have access to an infinite stream of immediate gratification of like bizarre German fetish midget porn. - Like literally whatever you want is on there. - Like whatever like bizarre fucking thing you could think of download it immediately to your fucking brain. - Like you have a crush in school. You could find a girl that literally looks like her get like fucked in all the holes. Yeah, like even these people find it incredibly funny. It's true. And the problem here is too, to just kind of build up on what you said, it's all immediate gratification, right? And the kind of stuff that we're teaching here with the dating advice is like you know, go out, build a personality, learn the game. It takes a while, you know? So you got a guy like me or you with a high sex drive and you're like, ""Well, learning the game is great and all but, let me jerk off first."" And you open the fucking laptop and here it goes, you know? All start to the jerk fest. - Right and what they've noticed is you know, they've done brain imaging studies and stuff like this and it's altering neural pathways. It's altering their brain in the same ways that addiction to say cocaine alters your brain. It's literally an addiction and recently I read the New York Times. The World Health Organization recently categorized sex addiction as a medical disease. - Holy shit. - Right? It has nothing to do with morality. It's actually an addiction. So there's hope for us. We're not actually immoral. We're just fucking sex addicts. (laughing) - [Max] I love it. - But yeah, anyway. So for me I know the reason that I disdained NoFap was because I literally didn't have time to fap, right? Because I had so many fuck buddies going on that like for me to actually jerk off that would actually take away from the performance later with my girl. It'd be like a disappointing performance. She'd be like what the hell is this guy doing like some limp dick motherfucker, right? So I really had to like save all that. So it was almost like a luxury for me. So to hear kids like complaining about this was actually I had derision toward it. I was like ridiculous, ridiculous. But again, now my thoughts have kind of actually changed. Now, I think that with this advent of immediate, infinite, free pornography one thing I think for the younger guys watching this it teaches you unrealistic things about how to interact with women, right? And the thing is too, it's like when you're going out and interacting with actual human beings it's teaching you things about social interaction even if those interactions are unsuccessful. That's what you have to understand. Like a lot of guys, well I can go out and I'm not having good interactions but... That's actually teaching you realistic things about how social interaction works, about how attraction works with women, and it's reinforcing reality as opposed to this pornography which is reinforcing a fantasy and again, feeding that addiction and beyond that, it's literally sapping your energy and your motivation. Right? So... - Yeah, I mean the thing is too like one of the biggest things from which we men derive energy is from our testosterone. So what you do is by just continuously jerking off you're resetting your testosterone over and over again and I notice it too like whenever I used to jerk off I'd be like, ah I'll just stay in bed, like especially before you get up. Stay in bed, herp de derp, la de da. Just keep zerping around the whole day and kind of the whole day goes down the drain. Instead if I get up right away after I wake up, I take a nice cold shower. I'm exposing myself to the goals that I wanna reach in that day and my whole life in general. I'm getting much more shit done and the things is too like when somebody asks us like but what if I have sex with a girl? Doesn't it also reset my testosterone? It does but at the same time, you've had contact with a real female. So there's a bunch of other hormones that get triggered that would not get triggered... - [Jeffy] Yeah, oxytocin, et cetera, et cetera. - Exactly that would otherwise not get triggered in that amount if you would just fap to some internet pornography. And of course on top of that there's the whole idea of pride and accomplishment when you actually have sex with a real woman instead of like... - Pride and accomplishment. What are you? A fucking... - Like EA... Yeah, yeah... - Get a minor transaction. - Instead of you know having jerked off to internet porn again, probably even feeling shame. - Yeah. - Like oh I should've gone out, should've fucked a girl, la de da. - And then too let's say you do go out and a lot of people say, well you know if you jerk off then you'll go out and you'll be less outcome dependent. But the thing is you can get to a point where you're so outcome dependent that you're not even trying. So let's say that you do fap. You rub one out, whatever, and then you decide, you know what? I need to go out regardless. So you motivate yourself, you actually go out, but what you'll often find is now you're interacting with these women and you're talking to them but there is not fire there. There's no umph there. So you're outcome dependent that you're literally not even trying and it gets to the point where it's counterproductive because if you think about it, what's the number one rule of pickup that I'm always talking about? Whatever you feel, they feel. Now have you ever gone up to a girl that like maybe at the beginning of the night you weren't attracted to or it was kind of a warm up set? You know, some old lady, some sort of person who has you know the earth's gravitational pull has a lot of influence on them, so to speak. And you're just kind of not into it. You can sense from them, they know this and they're like okay this guy's just kind of fucking with me and there's no fire there. And conversely have you ever had a time like in some of best interactions were ones that I wasn't even necessarily executing on a technical level perfectly but I just saw the girl there and she was like so my type that I was like (grunting) and my nostrils flare and I step to her and there's just so much raw, just so much raw attraction coming like waving off of me for her that again whatever you feel, they feel and she like just gets drawn into that and either she's gonna fuck off or she's just gonna immediately be like yeah boy and it's just fucking on because of that raw animal magnetism so to speak. So again, this participating in NoFap can help contribute to a night where you might have more of those types of interactions as opposed to these kind of like milk with toast, no dick behind it, where's the beef interactions or even if you actually are attracted to the girl again there's just no dick there and she can sense that and it just kind of fizzles out and peters out so to speak, no pun intended. Like you may have heard me talk about something called baby tiger syndrome in the past where I have a student and I tell him to do a physical escalation. He was actually going out there and he's doing the physical moves but he's so awkward about it that there's no actual intent behind it and the girl can kind of sense it. So it's like if a baby tiger came up and start attacking your leg. - Oh so cute. - Yeah, would you be scared? No, you\'re gonna be like, ""Oh it\'s so cute."" So you'll see the girls like kind of humoring these guys. - Yeah. - In the sense like, ""Look at him. He\'s doing his little move, Sarah. Oh, he thinks he\'s gonna fuck."" 'Cause they can tell there's no real threat there, right? So it's kind of a similar thing. Now for me, when I was younger I was like, one of the things that made me good when I was starting out early on in my career as a pickup artist or whatever was I was just a super horny little dude, you know what I mean? Like so again, I would go out and I would try to get it to the hoop all the time. I wasn't one of these guys who got into this out of a sense of like wanting to be cool. I wasn't one of these guys that got into it out of a sense wanting to impress my friends or 'cause I thought I should do it for the personal development. No. Man, for me it was like literally about sex. - Dick in pussy. - And again I think that's one of the things that made me good. But then as I got older this actually started to kind of become an issue because number one, my sex drive started to go down. Like not be as like crazy as it, like ravenous, slavering wolf as I was before. And then secondly after you've racked up a lot of experience you know you've slept with say like three, 400 girls or whatever you start to get a little more picky, right? Because let's say for example you know, you have slept with 400 girls. If I hook up with seven, there's a pretty good chance, I mean essentially I've probably hooked up with that girl 15 times before. Not her specifically but someone who looks almost identical to her. You know her hair, her facial structure, her general body shape, et cetera, et cetera. So for me it's like, oh great. Pizza again, you know what I mean? Essentially. So you become a lot more picky. So for me to even be motivated to step to those girls it wasn't there and then so if I started to jerk off like literally it'd be like rather than fuck a seven I would rather just fap. I would rather just jerk off. It's gonna be better than the seven. Even like 'cause yeah there's that great thrill of accomplishment, I won the game, I threaded the needle, I took it to the basket in spite of the defenses and everything. I mean that's fun but then like that was really the only thrill. The actual like prize so to speak, the sex, wasn't even that good. I was like okay, meh. I would've preferred to actually jerk off. So again, unless it was like an eight, like a really attractive girl or a girl who I have a lot of chemistry with and a lot of like, I've hooked up with a lot of times or we know what we like. It was kind of not worth it. So this is what kind of made me change my mind at the end of the day. I was like you know what? Now maybe NoFap's is a thing that I actually need to start to get into as well, right? - And I think one of the more important points here too to mention is that NoFap is not like this magic pill. It's like I'm on NoFap day 800. - And like yeah, the girls just like ding dong. Hey man. - Like ringing on your fucking doorbell. Like you still gotta take action though. It is a great thing to give you energy to take action, to keep you incentivized to take action. For me personally it helps me a lot at the actual act of physical escalation 'cause back in the days I used to physically escalate on a girl like I need to do the physicality. Touch the arm. - Like you know what I call that? You'll see the guy, I'm doing my keno. I'm doing my keno. - Here it comes. - And then you'd even see probably these guys literally they're back at the house they're actually like having sex and they're like I'm doing my keno. - But when I do NoFap and I've been doing it for years now on and off. And when I do it now I'm literally just like, I just wanna touch the arm. Just oh, oh. It's good because it's much more natural, congruent. It's easy for me to do. But again, it's not a magic pill. You still need to go out take action. You still need to endure painful experiences. You still need to overcome your fear et cetera. It will be easier to do so with the NoFap in the backlog kinda under your belt as some sort of like catalyst but at the same time it won't just do the work for you. So bear in mind, gotta go all the way. Still gotta take action. - Yeah and it'll give you energy not just for this, for going out, but for all kinds of other things. - Gym. - The gym. You know, doing work, working on your business instead of just... Diddling the day away so to speak. - Diddling the day. - On YouPorn or whatever. So (laughing). But again you've gotta, it's gonna give you energy but you have to direct that energy. It's not a magical pill. Now one thing that a lot of guys will say, I just don't have the willpower to actually do the NoFap. Like how can I actually get started with this, right? Again, sometimes you gotta come to that point of emotional leverage. Maybe you jacked off 15 times and your dick started bleeding. You got raw and that's the emotional leverage. Maybe it's just a sense of shame, pathetic, like you know guilt and shame that drives you to the point where you're like I'm gonna try this. Maybe it's this video. Maybe this video is gonna give you the emotional leverage. But still, willpower can only take you so far. There's a lot of little things that can help you, right? Number one thing that I might recommend would be something called a Pavlok. If you don't know what that is. A friend of ours, D, he actually makes this. It's a small device, kind of like a Fitbit, that goes on your arm and you can train it. It actually like delivers a small electrical shock whenever you indulge in certain behaviors, right? Like whether it's playing video games or smoking, biting your nails, or in this case. - Beating the meat. - Beating the proverbial, skinning the proverbial weasel, whatever you wanna call it, right? So that can help. It's called Pavlok. P-A-V-L-O-K. Another thing that I find is very helpful just to get the demon internet, like just remove it as even an option. Much like if you're trying to cut down on carbs. They bring the bread to the table at the restaurant. If you know you don't have the fucking willpower to not eat the bread, take it off the god damn table, right? So the same thing is like, if you know you're not gonna be able to open up that YouPorn or whatever the fuck RedTube whatever it is. There's an app called Freedom and this was developed ideally for social media. I use it for social media. But you can also use it for your like favorite pornography sites as well. It's called Freedom and what you can do is you can actually set your computer so you can not access those sites for a set period of time. You actually have to like shut down and restart the computer in order for it to actually be able to access if that time has not elapsed yet. Now of course guys could say well I'll just shut the computer off but that's an additional step that'll make your brain say hey, do I really wanna do this? Or do I wanna adhere to my goals and take it forward? Now again, the internet like I said, the rise of this has really contributed to the importance of NoFap I think today but the internet can also be, it's just a tool, man. And it can be a tool to help you indulge in this masturbatory fantasy that leads nowhere, to shame, guilt, a downward spiral of a lack of motivation, or you can use the internet to beat off. But you could also use the internet to have someone else beat it off for you. Now of course I'm referring to my program called Execute the Program which is my encyclopedic breakdown of online Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, whatever you wanna call it, online game. And I've been very, very successful at online game. Again, I've probably banged about 100 girls off of Tinder and related apps of that nature, OKCupid. And over a period of many years I codified my processes and my learnings into one program called Execute the Program and it goes over everything. It basically goes over how to setup your profile, how to setup your pictures, how to send the messages, how to get her on the phone, how to use the phone to actually set up the dates and get her to meet you out. How to conduct yourself on those dates with over eight hours of infield footage of me going on dates, of students going on dates with extreme breakdown. In total this program has about 24 hours of content. So if you wanna check that out it'll be very helpful, a much better use of the internet for you in terms of your sexual behavior and your sex life. You can check that out at executetheprogram.com. So anyway, this has been Max. - Yeah. - And Jeff. - Oh, I was supposed to say your name. - I guess, yeah. Or something like that. From Vegas and we'll see you next time. - Bam.

"[Music] I'm going to give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club who want to get laid girls who couldn't care less about some drunken douche Pro at the bar or about your self-actualization journey in the immortal words of Cyndi Lauper these girls just want to have fun and by have fun I mean have sex and we're talking a limitless ocean of girls here who are just as horny as you are if not more and are pretty much halfway DTF but don't take my word for it they say so themselves I guess you're pretty much guaranteed to get laid if you're an attractive woman so that's a plus it goes from G I hope someone nice cute cool talks to me at the bar tonight to let me decide whether I will fuck this person who already seems somewhat acceptable you're choosing from thousands as opposed to a random assortment of people at a bar the ability to choose who you talk to without having to deal with a bunch of Schmucks having some loser glom on to me and cock puck the guy actually want to talk to is a real problem um I don't really want to be going out every night to meet someone exhausting when I work all day want to get a workout in and be healthy plus there's zero chance of some sweaty asshole spring beer on you I actually mass texted this to all the girls I paying from online and these were the responses but I digress do you see a pattern here girls who want to get laid or fucking sick of weirdos at the bar or anywhere for that matter and the technology that was most likely created by men now allows women to turn the tables and choose who they want to fuck as opposed to wasting time at clubs having a fraction of the variety of men they have online yup hot girls who just want to get laid are actively trying to do so online and it's very fortunate that you planted on this page because by the end of this video I'm gonna make sure that you become one of the fun and cool guys she's already predisposed to fuck just like this yep this is what happens every time I open the app to see who will be going out with on any given night in any given city I go to and know this video wasn't edited I literally just mirrored my iPhone in my computer and just kind of sped it up a little bit because three and a half minutes worth of matches just too much a waste of your time this happens because I follow a repeatable formula that I've been honing since the very dawn of online dating way back on Friendster MySpace and even yelp.com for God's sake and by the way these matches happened in LA the seemingly hardest and most demanding city to hook up so now I'm going to tell you how to instantly increase your chances of getting laid tonight without having to leave your house except to go meet up for sex of course with six devious techniques that took me years to perfect and frankly I'm really sad to see him go but I do this shit for science and more importantly to get you laid I'm also going to give you my infamous one-liner that gets a 90 percent response rate and if they reply to this you're almost guaranteed to meet up with and most likely bang her this is a strategy I came up with it helps me screen the girl hard from the get-go to find out if she's down for sex that night and just note that this comes from years of trial and error until I found a repeatable and effective formula that literally any old schmuck can copy paste and go meet up with a girl who's DTF look I've coached literally thousands of guys to get laid every single weekend for over a decade and because I devote my weekends to turning you into a boss well my own time took a hit when it came to my weekly sexcapades but the last straw hit me hard one winter day on the slopes in Tahoe as a last run of the day I had Slayer blarin in my headphones going really hard and that's when my snowboard caught an edge and I went cart wheeling down the mountain long story short I was laid up on crutches for a month I couldn't go out but that's when inspiration struck I thought oh hey I remember I used to get laid off the internet yeah let's check that out again I went full mad scientist with shit figuring out how to get girls who are looking for sex just like you and me without having to exert much energy at all that would allow me to focus on approving my boot camps and getting guys like you results I had to come up with a way to not waste time and not just try to convince the one girl that made my wiener tingle as eyebrows with a broad selection of women who were down which ironically helped me to get that one girl later on time is the only commodity we have in this game and life really so over the past three years I developed a replicable copy-paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that lets me nitpick the hot girls on any dating site completely automate the process and get me dates left and right in any city I go to and now I'm gonna share that with you today so let me show you those six techniques I promised you number one don't attempt to pander to what you think a girl might like let's just put it this way any girl who agrees to go out with general durer has pretty much already made her decision and now it's on me and not fuckin up when I first started online game I presented myself in a way that I thought would be more appealing to a wide audience however what I found was that yes more girls would meet me out but then when push came to shove they wouldn't fuck what's the use of getting girls to respond to your messages if all that's gonna come of it as a wasted night in a set of blue balls the trick you have to display authenticity this triggers as little qualification as humanly possible while simultaneously displaying value with this approach I end up having an 85 percent close rate on those that do reply number two never buy any fucking means put up a selfie mode camera phone picture with your shirt off in front of the bathroom mirror with your toiletries all over the counter now the reason for this isn't what you might think women love a guy in good shape sure but the very first problem with this is that everybody is doing it you immediately love yourself into the regular guy category most of whom get blown off why well because you might look like a creep it just shows low social intelligence and by the way there is a good way to do the AB shot and have to be completely natural and get are drooling over your ripped fucking abs before you even message her and I'll show you how number 3 I'm going to give you the perfect first message my favorite one-liner that gets the interaction going now the first message you Center is pretty important but perhaps not as important as you might think oddly enough we're trying to walk a fine line here not too normal but not too douchey unique but not crazy romantic but not creepy and shorts but not too short perhaps most importantly it should be funny and fit with the tone of your overall profile it should make sense that this guy would send this message congruence is key but before I share with you I got to say I'm sad to see it go since this is pretty much as close to perfect as a first message could possibly be but time marches on here it is oh hi there I feel you appear attractive and consequently would like to explore the possibility of enhancing your life by means of exposure to my awesomeness kay thanks bye quite amazing I know but what's important is dissecting the principles that made it work so well so you can use that as a base to create your own unique messages remember I said congruence is key it expresses everything I want to say in an initial message to not fall into boring predictable and friendzone worthy now sometimes you have girls that were interested in you but for whatever reason you lost touch here's how you get her attention back number four my infallible one-liner to rekindle long lost conversations before I start a fresh cycle of message blasting I'll follow up on fizzled leads we've all had it happen life intervenes and the leaves just kind of fall through the cracks if the chick likes you even a little bit you have to allow her to get back into the conversation in a non awkward way and it's quite simple I feel like we're growing apart for the humor impaired watching this the line is funny because we were never close in the first place now if this doesn't work and I really really like the chicks look or style for whatever reason that is I'd really like to fuck her I'll even send a follow-up one the Hail Mary which will either get her back or seal my fate forever and you're absolutely gonna love it number five my favorite technique to breaking the ice when you first meet her out so things aren't awkward I mean meaning a random off the Internet can be pretty strange for both parties and after seeing this dynamic play out on my dates time and time again I decided to get proactive and I developed a strategy to defuse it before it even gets a chance to exist when I first meet the girl what I do is give her an immediate hug and say the following hey long time let's say how you been this gives the impression of those in the immediate vicinity that we know each other I mean I know when I'm out I can spot an OkCupid date a mile away and I'll usually make fun of them like like look at this toric many times another girl tell me that she felt nervous and awkward at the beginning of the date but I just somehow put her at ease very quickly this is why from there I will straight into the man to woman tone of the entire interaction that I've set so far by means of multiple strategies I use my profile and my initial messages number six getting girls back to my place on the first date mostly first hour now most guys set up their dates in a fairly haphazard way which can lead to mixed inconsistent results we will not be doing that you've got to understand that even though it's a warm interaction ultimately these girls hardly know you you want to take a two-pronged approach here first the way you structure the date itself must be absolutely airtight and setup the perfect opportunity for you to pull with the least amount of friction and hassle this includes everything from the selection of the venue to the manner of transportation straight through to the pull and secondly it's all about how you conduct yourself during the date and guess what that's repeatable too you must get her in that fun open adventurous headspace where you're then able to take her home and have an awesome night of mind-blowing sex the first night you meet her now if you apply these tweaks today your chances will have just increased by two million percent I personally guarantee these changes can make a world of

the most cutting edge work and pickup that I've done in years so I went on hundred of these dates for my research I slowly began to discover patterns emerging with my dates that didn't go so well and

course your occasional typical hot princess girl in many of those scenarios I ended up going home alone that night because I didn't know how to handle them so I made it my mission to keep hittin this

yo yo yo what up its meteor proverbial boy Jaffe and I'm here today with Ely a bit of a rising star in the rsd real social dynamics alt / organization and essentially he's been being groomed for a while to join the ranks of the rst executive coach instructor crew are you stealing him from me you have to go through me permission for a minute fine men and you had to be sweet say daddy got you daddy got me they were a package deal  and so today what I want to do is kind of have a little interview but before we get into that I'd like to take a moment to remind you to LIKE and subscribe so down below smash those motherfucking button so you can be getting this fucking content every Taco Tuesday so Evie welcome welcome welcome are now at me up today wonderful we have a sword we've got Bruce Lee and we got a fire pit with no fire and a fire yeah it's been warm for that today I'd say but I guess I'd like to start off by just kind of asking you about your experiences like how did you even get involved with RSD like how did that all come about I'm kind of hazy on those details I think I was I just kind of reached a point in my life where I wasn't happy in the woman that wearing my life at the time I think I was about 17 and I basically googled them like how to pick up girls and I think the first ever video that I clicked on was Julian's video and after that I started coming to ours events la street or before actually joining the team was your feature here in San Francisco so that was kind of Awesome so it's kind of cool to be like on the other side of like on the other side of now you're like kind of joining the the coaching staff it's kind of it's actually kind of crazy but through the looking-glass yes but I was attending events in California for a while maybe attended maybe like five six seven hot seats yeah with you included and then at some point just like fuck it I want to join the team so that's kind of how it came about okay so I'd like to also kind of explore that so we'll put a pin in that of like how how you came to like join the team and stuff like that I think that's something a lot of people are interested in you know I get a lot of emails from people saying like how do I join up how do I get involved in any capacity whatsoever so we'll talk about that but before that I'm curious you know what was your like game like prior to this I mean it's it was probably kind of the same old sob story that many have but like how's yours differ or how was it the same um when I first started and I started doing my first approaches I couldn't talk to like a girl I had to start with like asking a time on the street from like a random dude okay and now I can do that like a little bit okay fine now what's the next thing the next thing I maybe ask it from old grandma okay cool now I can do that so when I started it was really really bad I would get super shy my knees would shake every time I would approach and then over the course of the five six years I really put my foot down and kind of get that area of my life handled and at some point I had to make decision do I kind of follow a more career path let's just say more of an American Dream type of situation where you have a wife picket fence two and a half kids and this fake sense of happiness that I in my mind it was completely not something that I wanted and I start pursuing other things and because I watch so much of ours the content I was like maybe I'll come to an event and ask Owen for a job because I didn't want to go through application process and I figured there's like thousands of thousands applications so the same way like with a girl you want to be the guy that stands out the same with RSD I want to be the guy that stands out by the way I don't suggest you do that and come to an event to get a job and ask like yeah well that that actually kind of sounds very strange to me because I've seen that happen before and most the time Owen will just like because he's like super distracted he's running the event and done it and like most likely he'll probably just say something like oh yeah cool man cool and then just leave yeah so how did you actually manage to you know crack through to like get his attention in a way that actually resulted in you you know coming on in as an Assessor or to be honest Gaming a guy or like befriending a guy is the same way you would befriend a girl so if you're generally good at game you probably can figure out a way of like what this guy needs at this given moment but you're socially aware of the situation and that a person after free tour heads to a boot camp he's an extreme rush like what do you do so basically in this specific case with me I just waited until he talked to everyone all the fans taking pictures and all that and I came up to him simply offered value just like with a girl I asked him I have marketing degree I'm really interested in helping in business and this I have this in this experience how can I help you right pretty much it he's like oh cool where you from I'm like I'm from I'm from Ukraine so we speak like Russian and Ukrainian this and this told him about a little bit about myself he's like oh cool our head of marketing is Russian yeah here's his number chat with him right he texted Mikhail and he said hey this is Evie from Ukraine link-up with him I set up an interview so basically it was kind of no bullshit no beating around the bush not like oh hey I'm gonna try to like play some weird a mob game with your head or or act like some wacky ridiculous guys just cut you know cut to the chase like hey what's up here's the value that I could offer maybe you'd be interested boom and just serendipitously you know when you approach at the right time not when he's getting mob stuff like that yeah so the interesting part about that was also that like I didn't stop then cuz I'm like okay well I'll be forgotten within like few days right like they don't gonna remember four seconds more like it yeah so I knew the guy that I personally was friends with the guy that still it still am with the guy that was shadow on his boot camp for that weekend okay so he would tell me which venue they would go for that boot camp so I would kind of show up and like start randomly helping students and be like oh girls more girls I kind of got to the point where my game was good enough for to do something like this so I'd be like Oh girls oh let me introduce you to my friend Owen here and he was at the time with his girlfriend here in town so I was introduced into girls help out students I think I pulled with students then that same weekend I would drive them in between the venues yeah again like not asking any questions just simply like providing value yeah and week later after lab boot camp I got call from Owen and Mikhail asking me basically how much time do I need to move to LA I swear that's nuts about it it's funny too because it this way you're saying it relates to a game with you know picking up women it's very there's a lot of relatability there because it's all about what is the value proposition understanding what the value proposition is for you there's a guy going up to the girl you know very very clearly with the value as for you right you want to have intimacy in the night okay you want to have sex but what's the value proposition for her right so we see it so many times with students the girls are enjoying themselves and their group and part of the club and then the guy just kind of goes up and he's almost like hello ma'am may I join the fun can you buoy my state up what I'm offering nothing I'm not adding in or anything to like the energy of your night I'm not making your night more interesting more fun cooler in any way I just want you to like basically suck my dick like I would say hi and have you suck my dick so yes it's like you said it's whether it's business whether it's pickup etc like any of these social interactions you've got to be very very clear about what you're bringing to the table and no way to bring it to the table and more importantly be able to demonstrate that right because yeah you might have all these awesome qualities but if you're unable to demonstrate it and especially in like a constrained timeframe like for example at the club or in a situation where you've got this guy and he's on the run and you got to do your little pitch and they literally have 30 seconds yeah elevator pitch quote unquote so you have to understand very clearly it's like our buddy Derek another instructor always says he's like if you don't understand why the girl would want to fuck you how the fuck is she gonna know that so you have to understand very clearly what you're bringing to the table whether that's your ability to be fun and keep the interaction light fun and move things forward in a smooth way whether that's like you know certain qualities you might have that you're you know proud of cheese mints that you've done etc etc obviously not in a way where you're like qualifying yourself but you're putting it out there so it's very very obvious that why this person would want to hook up in you whether it's in a business capacity or in romantic capacity now let me know this is kind of funny I've always wondered because we were talking about this last night cuz he's up here helping out on bootcamp you know we got we got a few students up here and we're doing the debrief at the end of the night and one of the students bit of an older guy a successful fellow physician and we're we're talking about the van and he's like he says something like he asked a question he's thinking if the van is good would it be better if I had like a Ferrari and I'm like a Ferrari I'm like he's like it that's the band is getting cuz like again this is a very new guy he hasn't really don't pick up ever in his life he's coming into it a bit later in the games and it's like late 40 so he's just kind of confused about the whole culture the brevity yes like wow it seems like girls come to this ban because this a couple the other students actually pulled to the ban and stuff like that and so because that would it be better if I got like a Ferrari or like actually the Ferrari would probably be worse that it would probably be harmful because it makes you look you know like a like a try-hard bitch etc now we could make the Ferrari work right but there's a reason the guy who doesn't who's approaching it from like over look at the fur are you gonna fuck me why it won't work for that guy and and as a guy who is now living in Los Angeles and Hollywood Hills and and bringing girls up to you know the rst house which is essentially like you know a pretty nice house a mansion I just a call the least yeah it's fucking it's very very nice and so we're at Miami winter summit recently and we're up on the panel I get remember you guys talking about that how you in maze you'll pull these girls up to the house and before when you used to say oh this is my house you would have less success as you do now when you make sure to like when you're bringing the girls home before you even get to the house like now I just stay on the couch here this ball ginger guy owns two plays and then oh and isn't it late at all Owens like Owens meanwhile during the parties he's the one who's like run around make sure shits not getting stolen there's no comment I mean while these fucktards and his like bangin like Paul on every life surface in the in the in the home so what's your kind of thoughts on that I mean I guess I kind of summed it up but like what are your thoughts on that I mean for the most part when the guys in possession of some cool assets or a cool lifestyle they try to use it to over compensate for the lack of social skills yeah or the lack of complete unawareness of like what are you supposed to do with an interaction with a girl so it's coming from a really wrong place of trying to impress the girl like here's my Ferrari fucking fuck me now like come on let's do it like I haven't but can't you see the Ferrari you don't want to fuck don't didn't you see the Ferrari or the home like what are some kind of the reactions you would get when you would pull the girls to that place under the you know giving her pressure that you'd like live there like the interaction would start very sexual very interesting because like me and maze and only what we gain we're like very edgy guys right just at least like yes they're pretty edgy and now they're so it's on like immediately and whenever we bring up a house and we actually take the girl there and say oh actually you're like yeah we actually live here yeah and they're like oh okay they they start acting a lot more sophisticated and now they're trying to be like not that kind of girl that was treasure like where's like party time yeah it was it was so fun because we are like both fun guys just outgoing going crazy it's so fun but then oh now this guy has this huge house oh and there is a Ferrari oh and all that like come on like it's it's really bad so what do we we tested that out that didn't really work out really well and the best thing that we figured that works for us is when we come to the house we just say oh we actually don't live here we just crash here yeah it's simple change like we just oh we just cross again our friend lets us crash here which raises our value because we have friends that would let us crash at a huge mansion right yeah so this like pure wind from that place and we're not trying to kind of impress a girl with that it's like oh the house now so what are we gonna do are we gonna go to the bedroom now like we don't do that and then also to add a little bit on top of that will fuck around with Owen and won the girl like when we like as soon as we open the door and the girls walk in and they're like oh so whose house is this I'm like oh it's this guy me and maze are broke yes it's kind of like back in the day when Julian used to show his bald spot yeah that's kind of our new version of that you know it's really fun yeah so okay speaking of hair yeah because I this is another thing that's quite fascinating to me and it's a similar vein as what we've been talking about it's like I you know I noticed from when you first kind of came on vs. today you're look as it were has become a lot more colorful you know kind of garish almost like this kind of fuckboys style I guess you'd call it back in the day but shit will you to where all kinds of peacocking stuff quote-unquote where we would literally wear like a top hat with goggles with like black painted nails rings on every finger five watches like a mesh shirt with like a pendant and then like another five pounds of like fake bling and then like a belt buckle that lights up and has a message and then like fake leather pants look like a snake and like boots that are eight inches high and and like a fake eerie you know and it's like nobody told us you don't have to wear all the peacocking shit at once guys like you know so now it is I kind of will just will rock you know I then I got more conservative I had that ridiculous mullet for a time which I noticed was very polarizing you know they would absolutely love it or they'd absolutely hate it and but then you know over time fashion has swings back and forth and then we started to get more normal looking but now I kind of see like the trend is going back more towards like whack a tire like when we go out tonight I'm gonna be dressed like a complete fucking lunatic like Members Only jacket like fake leather with like fucking wolf shirt and my fingerless gloves and like a creepy murderer glasses and shit like so so I guess the question is like in may is also very colorful and my parents always kind of animal print patterns and stuff Julian to looks like some kind of like homeless Jesus now and I think I think we're kind of like taking it back there so what's what's kind of motivated you to go in that style and like is that how much that is related to you know being in it the LA scene versus say you know a guy who's watching this who might be in like I don't st. Louis Missouri or something like that right I mean um mainly we look like this because we are in LA and we actually look normal for LA yeah like I didn't don't surprise anyone like Ryan when I go out here like last night we went out for the first night of the bootcamp sometimes the girls would open me and the guys would open me like also what do you do where are you fry or your DJ yeah you an actor like this like in my Luckies I think I saw you somewhere I'm like yeah I don't know what what would that be no are you an actor I think I've seen you in the movie like electively were the coolest people there and then appearance-wise like if you were to look and be like who are the coolest people that something's going on with that right so it's very attention-getting but like so in LA though you're saying is just kind of like more than natural in LA like the way I look right now it's completely like I'm missing like an exit ooh and fucking too under my eyes like it's not enough for the Hollywood scene so particularly it's working from a peacocking standpoint when we go to any other town because we just look very edgy and we look not like anyone else like in my mind whenever I'm in the venue I want to be standing I want to send out from all the other guys that are there right now I don't want to be just another boring guy with a su attend of Thai just asking if I can buy a girl a drink yeah we're just like you know a black shirt you know pants etc and with a with a hair specifically I was just I had the same hairstyle the same European typical hairstyle for like 10 years yeah and then I was just like if I could I want to do something cool and I was kind of debating should I do braids cuz like my hair grew up should I do braids or dress and I was like fuck it I'll do dress I'll see how it looks and then yeah I loving it I'm just like oh I mean shit you can always cut the fuck off right yeah I was grow back that's a thing to experiment you know for people watching this who maybe think that that's kind of outside their comfort zone definitely experiment with it I mean everything must be field tested that was the episode we had many many years ago when we were first starting out stick it so holes true today I mean you know bare minimum think about peak hockey it's one of those things that gets kind of a little bit of ridicule the risen because it's very closely associated with the old hardcore PUA stuff from the game right like that's the big takeaways that filtered down from that that whole subculture into the mainstream is like Meg's and peacocking right well with peacock and really all it is it's just like standing out in the venue in such a way that it allowed number one it allows any woman who finds you attractive it gives her an excuse to open you because generally women don't open that's just kind of the cultural that's the way the game is played you know love it or hate it it is what it is so it gives anyone who thinks are attractive now she has an excuse oh your hair or whatever oh this fucking thing done done tonight etc that's number one number two it just generates attraction in and of itself why not because of the garish thing itself but when you're there's a saying in Australia the tall poppy gets cut right so by virtue of putting yourself making yourself at the this point of interest I guess you'd say in the club you're essentially holding your own self up for ridicule right you're you're putting social pressure onto yourself and it is the grace with which you handle that social pressure that causes the attraction not the garment itself for example I used to wear that pink suit if I'd wear that out like I had this 3-piece pinstripe pink suit if I would wear that thing out if I was in a good mood people would be like awesome suit dude this is rad where'd you get this man right whereas if I was more self-conscious and not really feeling myself that night people would talk shit like it would literally invite them to talk shit they could sense it look at this fucking you hear these comes like a look at this fucking guy oh my god hey bro no I suit like in mocking comments and stuff like that again I was out at the park the other day I was wearing this shirt and this is cult leader and then I opened these girls and I started talking to him in a little ways and she's like you know I saw you earlier when you were walking up and I said I fucks with that guy cuz he's got that cult leader shirt and I was like haha right so again you often like because we're getting a lot of comments on the YouTube videos you know in the comments section a lot like Julie and especially it's like what are you doing with the style so I kind of wanted to give a little insight into that now let me ask you this cuz I'm very curious about you know this whole la scene how do you think it's changed because I used to you know I've game down there a plenty but I think it's probably even gotten a little more what's the word I'm looking for like full of Craven cocksucking Fame whores I guess you call it up I mean people people but people have a good time down there they know how to party I think a lot more than they do necessarily up here in San Francisco like people a little more button-down and kind of nerdy down there motherfuckers like to have a good time but especially with like Instagram and tinder sub how do you think that that's kind of changed the day that the game down in my mind in LA that's like where the hog girl goes because of her looks you know what I mean so everyone in America yeah like yeah that's where you go to try to make it as someone who gets paid for the attractive like you can't lie I haven't seen another city where you just walk down the street and you consistently see tents all the time like it just happens like you walk into Hollywood and you just see these girls that like go to a Equinox or they go to get their green juice or whatever the fuck right so yes and there's like modeling agencies like one after another and you see these really attractive girls so there's already guide that sorry what was the question so yeah so like that the LA scene like how do you think it has changed or is oh you're God Alice and in the way of like Instagram and etc etc the thing with Instagram and specifically la scene the girl when the girl first arrives there you have like basically a month or two months for a normal person to meet her yeah if she's past that window she's she's off to like Drake's house if she's really hot I mean she's taken in yes systems that's it she's she's off to like promote her friends yeah that we came out with like she's off there you know what I mean so there is always a guy that is richer than you in LA harder percent like you can't compete with a guy that makes like a billion lives in fucking like huge ass mansion right like it's it's insane you can't compete with a mega level fuck boys cuz there's always guys that have more time than we do more tattoos more tattoos I'm now gonna compete with a guy that's tattooed like he's he's gonna be more edgy so the only thing that you can compete on is basically emotions and emotions that he provides her girl because she already has an offer to go to let's say Cabo for the weekend on a boat she has an offer to go to Ibiza with some dude she has an offer to come to the mansion to the party she already has an offer for like a sugar daddy offer she already has all that and she also has all the fun boys getting her up so what are you the way my game changes like I don't want to be that guy in the middle yeah I don't want to be the provider guy obviously and I don't want to be like the promoter cooked out promoter right so the only thing I have to offer is emotions to be somewhat relatable to that girl you know what I mean so that's kind of specific about like la scene is basically stand out from like no being the guy in the middle and stand out from the tomb that she's getting kicked out way how do you feel about that like so wait was have you lived in LA for how long about a year and a half now and where do you live before that before I live like a small town in California a small town so so how did you feel going did you ever harbor like cuz I know a lot of guys see this kind of stuff and it's very very easy for them to get into like negative thoughts or like sexist like massage and his thoughts like it's booking cos getting there free shit cutting the line okay they get in these places and separate like see a lot of guys like there's two ways you can go when you when you're confronted with this the reality of house how it goes and to be fair again if you're one of these people who does live in a small town you know well I don't live another la this doesn't apply to me well there's a microcosm of that whole obnoxious scene pretty much in every town you know like even in some like small you know hundred thousand person town there's gonna be like the cool guys and the one or two cool places you go and there's like the cliquey scene so it does this kind of stuff does apply but like on a more micro scale but it's very easy like didn't get into a negative headspace like they're getting all the shit's like dude avoid that with don't become this like jaded fucking like bitter misogynist dude because that's not going to help you get the girl student to begin with and then secondly they are going to turn 35 trust me okay and then the fun will be over so you know it's like so don't get yeah I would like I mean did you ever struggle with that like oh man it's like unfair or anything like that actually no because I took it from a right place where I'm like yeah okay well in order to compete with right these dudes I have to first of all I have to assess the situation I have to look at the guys that are getting the type of girls that I want brightest naturally I'm not good at game or getting wait I'm good at this like even maybe four years ago I would bring the girl flowers to like the first date and I wouldn't understand why she doesn't like me yeah like naturally I'm not good so I have to look at other people and figure out like what's the way right so I see mostly the guys that are really jaded about the way women treat them is the garden don't get laid yeah that's kind of the most part the guy did actually do get girls they're actually really happy and they don't feel like this misogynistic hate towards towards them well like what came first the chicken or the egg did they not get laid because there have those negative bitter feelings or do they have a bitter face because they don't get lay and then it's just like this feedback it's a constant loop yeah the bitterness the hatred that yeah terror the bitterness the hatred the terror the anguish so moving beyond that I also wanted to kind of ask you your experience as an instructor right because that's a whole different angle it's one thing to pick the girl's up to learn how to do pickup it's quite another to learn how to transfer those skills to other people so I don't know how for me personally I continue to I've been doing this for 16 years and pretty much every weekend all over the world and I can't if you think how can you continue to do this don't you get bored with it doesn't get tiresome seeing the same old problems but Jeff how do I approach with the friends you know stuff of that nature but the reason I continue it is because I see the change happening in the guys every weekend like by the from the beginning on Friday when we meet them up to you know Sunday afternoon or you know Thursday Sunday whatever the whenever the end date is and seeing them actually having made significant improvements and in my case a couple weeks ago I was in New York had this kid straight out of well he's a Pakistani dude but he's from like Sri Lanka or something and he he flew out totally terrifying like scrawny little like freaky scary dude running up in girls faces by the end of the program he had got actually pulled gotten laid we we coached him to like dial it back and he he looked like a totally different person like it literally it looked like a different person and he's like thank you so much this is dream for me like he's like the girl like the girly bangs like she called me pimp she's like Daddy boy like I'm like it has a pimp daddy boy you know and that's why it like we're seeing that in their eyes like it's really for me it takes me back so when I was first learning the shit and it kind of like lets me reminisce in a way but I don't know what is your what are some kind of in the biggest challenges that you face like when you find coaching students or some of the most interesting stories or anything about that like what's your experience I mean the initially the hardest part for me was to actually put the stuff that I do into wards yeah because like when you're in that flow state and you're having fun in the venue it's really hard to go back to a student and explain like oh hey I said this this and this sometimes like either remember my first ever boot camp was in Miami it was with oh I was just assisting oh when I wasn't actually teaching I was just a sistent the student would see me doing something cool or like making out with a girl and then would come to me and ask me oh hey so what did you tell her copy - how did that happen like you know you just opened the kind of God you just in the flow like laser eye contact you just pull her in you start making up he's like what did you say and I'm like I don't remember what did I say so I had to really dial back everything that I do and kind of understand exactly the process and very logically describe it so then I can actually teach someone else and for the main part the the thing that made me want to do it in the first place is cutting the learning curve of these guys like for me I don't want a guy if they go through the same shit that I went to yeah like I don't want a guy to like bring flowers to the girls and think why she doesn't want to sleep with you I don't want the guy to do all that shit so for me when I started teaching I was like okay I actually was gonna take bootcamp myself when back in a day but I couldn't do it because I was just broke consistently like all the time I couldn't afford it so when I right now I come to the program I'm like okay we got three days to basically from five years got your learning curve to like six months to a year if you put your work into it I know what I mean and that's kind of what drives me to see the the change and then to see guy next year won't be travel to the same city again see that guy actually crushing it or like sending pictures to the group chat keep in touch with all the CAS that we have it's actually really fun to or that ya are just saying like I said it seems like a different person it's like they're way more chilled out they just seem way more grounded way more at ease and I think it's helping learning this stuff it's literally helping these guys to not fall into that bitter negative trap that creates these extreme behaviors that you'll see sometimes like these in cells or whatever you know these red pill in cells that are like killing people and stuff like that I mean I'm I'm not trying to say like we prevent fucking school shooters or whatever like that but the point being I'm just those those are extreme outlier cases but just that mindset of Kitson who gets a person into like a deep depressive state or it becomes bitter about the world or it you know for example that this whole la scene it's so fake etc it's like if at least you know the parameters of the game write it once you understand how it works then you can begin to adapt your approach and it don't whine about the parameters because most people don't even fucking know the parameters just be happy that you're aware of what they are so by making people aware of this stuff they can start to make changes in their behavior that are gonna have a positive result net result on their actual day day life experience with us romantically or just encounter interacting with people socially out in the world or business etcetera it's our friends family what-have-you so having said all that what do you think are some of the biggest challenges that you like the most common challenges you see on students in bootcamp because I know I know mine I can tell you right now what I think mine are because I I see this almost every weekend but like what do you what do you think are the main things that guys who are new at this typically have to work on first I think in my personal opinion if I would have to summarize this into a short kind of short description I would say it's probably 80% of guys the the lack of balls in general yes is insane that's it it's it's just it's it blows my mind like every weekend I'm like oh wow when you see it like an older guy let's say the guy in his 50s that got divorced and he's a doctor he makes shit loads of money or he's like a lawyer or whatever and he comes on the program and he learns from 25 year old that looks like basically like a girl told me the other day was funny she was like hey I just wanted to let you know your hair looks like you have a lot of sex this is the funniest quote of all time yeah um but the law basically I would say that 80% of guys are very timid the we get on program they're very quiet you to the point where the girl can actually hear them so we kind of have to unravel years and years of trauma and years of years of social conditioning that were built in his brain like over the course of the years from like old influences that the person had because when he was actually born like 50 years ago or whatever or any age for that matter he didn't come out of the womb like that right he didn't come out quiet and like a shy and stuff like that it it's the experiences over the course of that of his lifetime that made him behave in certain way right so we basically have to unravel that timidness the quietness and not understanding how to be physical even with like a girl they lived like rubber girl is like I don't know you just kind of you let it kind of fool give her an opportunity to come in like lack of social awareness that sort of say is the most the most common things and also it's totally understandable let's say you're a lawyer that was married for 20 25 years 30 and you were just with your wife but then you figure out that she's been cheating on you for ten years and then you come on a program and try to learn social skills it's totally understandable that you're not aware on how to talk to go to the bar so you come you order a drink and you just kind of stay there and hope something happens yeah and then you say hi and the girl just walks by and you're like well I thought it's gonna be easier but at the same time think think about it you you're trying to basically sleep with a girl half of your age and I touching her at the bar and saying yeah by touching her in a bar saying creepy shit it's like it's it basically takes a lot of work and we like I said it took it took ask how many years to get decent I mean it's so many years so many painful painful moments so many painful years producing memories yeah but um it takes a lot of work and the guy just common expects something to change within you know within like one approach oh now I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna get the new government does this work that way right and I feel like I may agree with you there's the two big ones are number one the lack of balls or the lack just the fear the protective intent trying to avoid negative outcomes and just a fear to take it to a romantic level to express themselves romantically sexually whatever you want to call it they just why there's literally they just want to go up and like chitchat and hope the girl is gonna jump on their dick and you have to learn you got to put yourself your balls on the chopping block so to speak your personality on the line and say what's up this is my interest in you do you do you share this intricate this interest or should I go talk to someone else like they they just can't put themselves to like face that potential rejection it's like shit man it's like the same level of fear that was in high school like what do I tell my crush it's like that same fundamental fear of rejection loss of validation embarrassment possible confrontation with others in the venue at cetera et cetera so I think like you said a big part of piracy is the question we you know we get scrapland with over the past 15 years is how do you teach balls right how do you teach someone to have balls well you give them some strategies give some tools to work with and experiment with and see how that works and I I had a student who asked me at the end of the program a couple months ago he's like Jeff you know I see you out there and we're talking to girls like you're very confident you talk a lot like well you always like this no I was not always like this was like how did you become like this well cuz I saw the shit that I was doing didn't work you know what I mean I kept trying it I'm like well this doesn't work other people are advocating I'd be a little more forward I'd be a little more aggressive quote unquote and we say aggressive found the scary way but like a fun cool way but like try to move it forward a little bit more don't just sit there and enjoy the good validation feelings that you get from a girl like that actually deigned to speak with you about some boring bullshit like okay it's going good she's laughing at my jokes stuff now let's try touching her a little bit now let's try throwing out some flirtatious comments and see how she reacts to them and then push it forward then now let's try and say hey let's get out of here and suggest you go back to the van or for the hot tub or or your place for her place right so lower the hold once they actually start to try on some of these more assertive behaviour they say that oh well what do you know it actually works at least a lot more than what I was doing before and then that's when the change actually starts to happen there start to move towards that and their personality serves become literally more assertive that's how they get those balls right I think it's massively important and the the best way like the best knowledge that I'm thinking of it's like it's the lack of spine with that make sense and also lack of boundaries in these guys right it's a happens very often in marriage where the person that the girl married is not the person that they married anymore and it's it's mostly coming from like complete lack of boundaries and lack of kind of you never say no in a way you know I mean you always have that one friend that just never says no to anything that's by the way the best way to end up in our friend zone in a romantic encounter let's just say it's like never say no to a girl she's like let's go shopping help me move help me move yeah yes I have few friends like that back in the day yeah and I would I would watch like old are is the continent like bro you can't do this your girl will fuck someone else like don't stop like stop it right now yeah but that goes back to who's saying like it bleeds into other is life and that's why I'm so passionate about doing these programs and kind of sharing value through these videos and everything else is kind of changing from personal development perspective changing their life on all the others yeah yeah it's been it's been pretty cool like I said we've been running boot camp this weekend so it's been really interesting to see how upfront kind of style you're bringing to the table is very it's just a lot of fun you know it's very enthusiastic it's very fun you're very motivating I think a lot of coaches not done this in the past where I was kind of like the drill sergeant type character and I've tried on everything like code and every way of approaching it you know you're just like do this do that but like one thing I've noticed I've learned over the years is you can't bully someone into having fun like have fun damnit you're gonna have fun it's like one of the key things Lars D at least for my program and I kind of know some use like we go first when we walk in the venue were the first ones to like crack open the sadden like start and the girls because that's what's kind of like a rising tide the assault boats so yeah it's been really cool the students seem to love it we're seeing results two students pulled last night first night and you know I get the proof is in the pudding so you know so welcome to the team it's good to have you and thank you for showing me a channel you want to talk a little bit about projects you have coming up or my channel is up so it's created but my date scheduled for the first posting is in a middle of August I believe I have to check the marketing calendar of the whole team because we are salami haters and everything that coming up so you'll know about when the first video is actually getting posted from all the inner circles so there's gonna be a post about it so Augusta's new team will leave the link down here below right now you can go ahead and subscribe so that way you will get notified when the first video comes out but with that thank you very much for having me on channel that's a pleasure to be in the same in the same frame in front of the camera with a benign janessa can I help you know let me know yeah well cool man thanks for coming out thank you for watching everybody [Music],ADV6dFgGnIQ
yo yo what up this is Jeffy I'm here at Stockholm Sweden today Goleta Giannone vet spot on Rock Mecca aka gliding through life on a shrimp sandwich and today I want to talk about what you do when you're in the club and you go up to a girl and before you can even get a word in she basically just immediately says something like extremely mean and bitchy to you she's like stop talking go away go away yeah right and you're like what I didn't even say anything right so when that happens what do you do let's find out yeah so this is a question that somebody sent me via email and this guy says Jeff this has personally never happened to me but to my friends what do you do when the girls being sarcastic to the point where it's mean so for example stop talking so so I do see this from time to time it has happened to me you know she is is to be expected for someone who's been going out and doing cold approach pickup for for 15 years at one point or another somebody has said don't fucking walk away walk away whatever right so however I see it it's rare it's few and far between I do see it a lot more with new guys with newbies and typically this this response is generated by a weak approach when a guy's doing a half-stepping approach when he's giving off a vibe that the girl immediately dislikes okay and what you need to understand is well listen there's a couple there's several things going on here first of all there's the guy's approach which is triggering this response but before we get to that let's ask ourselves why is this response even a thing right why would a girl simply immediately without even hearing what the guys to Sage bag stop talking away well this is a big part of pickup that a lot of guys fail to understand which is you need to yourself in the woman's shoes and have an understanding of what her day-to-day experience is in terms of her interactions with men okay because again women are being assaulted I noticed and sold it but they're they have this barrage of male attention coming at them from all sides at all times and much of it is unwanted unwanted advances from guys whose approach is terrible okay ninety percent of guys are doing what we call a half step or approach when they actually approach and they think it's awesome like they think that it's it's the correct approach internally they know it's not the correct approach but I see a guy half steppin what does half steppin mean half steppin means he's not fully committing to the approach he's not putting his balls on the line and he's not fully committing to the approach now why do people do this I say 90% of guys are doing this you know students are doing this on bootcamp and guys who are just trying to learn it on their own you know I'm sure that I see this all the time guys doing these super weaksauce approaches the girl walks by they kind of brush on the arm but do it girl just like what and just continues on or they go up and they say some dumb shit and then the girl gives a quick acknowledgment and bounces out the guys are what they're doing is they're causing this reaction subconsciously they're half-stepping because they know it's not going to work because they don't want it to work it's the same reason why people do catcalling right like on the street hey baby Derr Derr Derr they know that shit's not going to work right because internally they don't want it to work because if the girl stopped and actually engaged them they wouldn't know what the fuck to do with it it's like again like the dog chasing a car what the hell is going to do if it catches the car like you know what he got catches the car and I can just drag down the street so they just want to go in get their little quick acknowledgment for the girl and then bounce out so they can say I did my approach so the girl sees this shit she sees it all the fucking time so I go great another one of these right so why even deal with it you know because if she talks to the guy that's gonna be three minutes of her life or you know even a minute of her life she's never gonna get back so why not just tell him you know what fuck off right now let me just stop right there fuck off so one thing to ask yourself if you if you're getting this reaction if you see if you go up in that you get this reaction is am i half steppin right because that in and of itself is going to trigger that kind of response going to be more likely to trigger that kind of response so you have to ask yourself is what I'm doing the cause right first and foremost look within to see if you are at the cause of this right is your approach triggering this so that's number one second thing to understand some just might be an autopilot response maybe she she's been approached by like several guys that evening who were doing this quote-unquote half-stepping and so she thinks you're the you know the next idiot of the night so to speak in fact that's like one of my favorite openers I'll go up and I'll be like good evening I'm the next idiot of the night speaking with you and what that does is it shows her I'm aware of what's going on I'm different than these guys and so much of is just being different you know if you've seen some of my other videos some of the more outlandish openers I do you know like you know girl wearing the striped shirt I'll be like fucking Hamburglar Botstein Lee a fucking burger Haut or whatever nonsense or you know good evening I'm Bill Cosby can I buy you a drink you know nonsense like that it's not that these things are so amazing it's just it's different right okay here is not another dirt derpy coming up another dirt boy coming up being like oh you're beautiful put his hand on my arm right so there's that are but but even having said that maybe again maybe she's been approached by several guys that night so she thinks you're the next Diddy of the night and it's just an autopilot response but let's say she does you do you go up and you're not one of those guys but you know you're doing a full a full fledged approach but nonetheless she's like walk away Durr so what am I going to do in that instance well I'm just going to plow through it man I'm not going to like flinch it that's the biggest thing I'm not going to flinch it right I'm going to continue its a basic I treat it as a basic congruence test shit test so what are some of the basic ways to handle a shit test number one is the display of lower value I might be like oh man let the mean cool kids used to make fun of me in high school shit this fucked damn three years of therapy down the drain now I'm gonna go home and cry in the darkness while looking at a candle and listening to Lionel Richie and putting cigarettes out of my dick like I do every night my entire dick is just one cigarette burn like my entire genitalia is just one big cigarette burn I use that as like an ashtray one of smoking anyway Digital swing-through by this point she's like what the fuck this guy is different again you just I want to change I want to change the emotion of the interaction so what's the normal number one rule of pickup whatever you feel they feel so rather than flinch it and get drawn into that negativity I'm going to continue to beam the state I want which is party dong which is again awesome enthusiasm about being there enthusiasm about life and attraction to her again not like a creepy attraction but like a fun cool attraction right like damn girl lookin good bring you wanna share my life with you right again a collaborative frame that's where I'm coming from I come from like trying to weasel into her party I'm coming from I'm having an awesome time I want her to have an awesome time with me right and I swing through that's the biggest thing - I swing through I go up and I don't just say the upper and then stare right now again she's like walk away walk away walk away walk away dirt hey listen now come now that's not appropriate in Obama's America done today and you know how doesn't say else's continue to say some Jim person she sees again I'm not one of those half stepper guys I continue to be in the energy and due to the law of state transfer if she sticks around long enough usually is going to take like 10 15 seconds and I prove I'm not one of those guys a lot of times you'll turn those around just by again plowing it swinging through continue to beaming positive energy not flinching it right that's the biggest thing not actually flinching it so again through training the more and more you you go out the more approaches you do you'll you'll see what that you're not vaporized when this kind of stuff happens so again then time and time again the more experience you get the whether you see these like autopilot responses and again the walk away thing is just simply an exaggerated form of the typical autopilot response which is what the the skeptical look right you know the tapped I tap on the shoulder then she's like like oh great what do you what do you want right so the thing is a lot of guys can't get over this because they feel they're interrupting the girl are you interrupting the girl yeah but you have to view yourself as more valuable than the than the interruption right and that comes from being centered grounded in yourself staying in your lane as Tyler calls it playing your strengths and just like being yourself not trying to cater to what you think they might want swinging through now sometimes this like mean response this you know walk away or whatever that response it comes maybe it's not an autopilot response but maybe she was just having a really bad day right maybe she's just having a really bad day now in that case what you want to do is again don't chain what's the old aphorism change her mood not her mind so the same rules apply I'm not I'm not going to like try to argue the point with her or anything like this I'm just going to act you know fun maybe a little silly and swing through and continue to be in that positive energy the idea being hopefully I can crack it and I'm gonna bring her in now maybe you're not able to crack it okay maybe she's you know maybe she's just a fucking asshole okay maybe maybe you've just encountered a person who is actually an asshole right heaven forbid you know like who would have thought you've encountered an asshole out in the club you know some people whose fucking jerks and maybe that's maybe you've encountered one of those in that case don't even bother with like you know again I will try to swing through but it she's like now fuck you dare - dare - dare and she's just an extremely unpleasant person I'm not gonna try to like change that but here's the thing I used to be like you know I used to like come and try to come back with some shit you know I'd be like fuck you ho look at your fucking face your fucking eyebrows look all dumb some shit trying to get live did you know you know some some insult or you know some like mean-spirited comment designs like break her ego down because I'm like people shouldn't treat other people like this this is disrespect right disrespect and a lot of young girls especially they get hung up on this shit and and the older I get I realize no one can really no one can disrespect me in any meaningful way and furthermore you know I realize I'm not Batman you are not Batman it is not your job to dole out vigilante justice to the mean girls at the club right because I used to be like if she does it to me she's probably gonna do to some other nerd that doesn't have the fucking balls than I do and he'll be crushed or something like that so I need to teach her not to do this she won't she'll think she'll think twice next time right but here's the thing again I I did it I did this all the time so I'm speaking from experience here what I'm saying it's a waste of your energy so fucking waste of your energy to get involved in it like that right so I'm not going to be like say the mean comment or anything because look is it gonna change your fuckin mind no it's probably going to entrench her beliefs even further that guys are fucking jerks might make her act more of a dick to the next person and furthermore it's wasting your energy right again the respect is not a commodity in the in the game in my opinion you get respect from yourself right I have self-respect so I don't need the respect of some stranger who I'm approaching again I can approach who I like and they can tell me to fuck off they like that's how the game is played I understand that but bottom line again this respect is not a commodity and to check like disrespects you it might feel bad in the moment you know you might have that knee-jerk reptilian brain reaction to so you know hit back but if you think about it how was this so-called disrespect affecting you in your day to day life in any quantitative way it's not again because some asshole sort of mean called you a mean name in the club it doesn't affect your day-to-day existence in any fucking way at all right so when you understand that you arrived at the at the conclusion that time is really the only commodity you have in the game because on a given night there's only a certain number of minutes in the club and as such you need to spend them wisely and furthermore you also have a finite Reza of emotional energy when you're out in the club and you know a lot of guys I used to have this - you go out and at the end of the night you're tired you feel exhausted nowadays at the end of the night I feel energized it's almost difficult for me to get to sleep right I have to meditate to like bring my state down because I'm not trying I'm a letting go right so Tyler says that there's three ways I'm sure there's more than this but generally the the three main things that will burn your energy through the course of matter number one deciding whether to go like you see the girl in you're like oh should I go oh should I wait for a second what's my opener what angle should I approach you know that whole like mustering up the nerve to approach and asking whether or not you should that burns energy number two is what we call persona fatigue where you're going up to the going to okay and you're not being authentic you're just you're putting on some persona and attempts to make her like you to make her stay and keep talking you that burns energy and third what we're talking about here most remained to this point is what we call judgement energy like when you come out of the you come out of the interaction you're judging yourself right so again if you do if the chick tells you to fuck off you know stop talking me you don't mix us immune shit and then you come out of that interaction you know and you hit back now or even like you come out of it like pissed off that she said that and now you're like harboring and negative energy you're gonna be thinking about it you're like damn it just booked your host sucks I'm that was a negative experience and now what's that's going to permeate your vibe and you're going to be predisposed to you know it's going to predispose you to get rejected on the next approach because you're in that headspace so then you go up you do the next approach and you get rejected and then it's just a downward spiral throughout the night right so again to summarize if you get that go away stop talking reaction first ask yourself is my approach triggering that okay am i half-stepping am I like this ineffectual little plant that's wasting our time or am i bringing the party am i showing intent and my sweet my lie to my antennae my swinging through right am I in the state I'd like her to be in etc etc that's number one number two if it is that autopilot response don't flinch it use standard shit pet shit test congruence test passing measures to get by it and you know whatever you feel that she feels drawn read your reality move from there hopefully you can fix it she's in a bad mood understand you want to change your mood not her mind and finally if you just have a bonafide asshole again don't tell her don't I try to tell her off don't again don't try to be Batman just literally be like okey-dokey and just boom turn your head and it's on to the next immediately without wasting any energy so your night continued on an upward spiral not a downward spiral all right so hope that answers your question I guess I'm not to go enjoy some traditional Swedish foods such as coca-cola which means balls because I love balls haha I love Swedish meatballs so awesome so I'll see you next time and honesty nation  you,AIoIdLWo2j4
what officer proverbial boy Jeffy and I'm here to be in Dallas Texas  [Music]  [Music]  [Music]  so the question is when you approach the girl you can go with comfort building or you can go with attraction well this is pretty interesting because I feel that most guys what they do untrained people in their mind it's very simple what to do you go for comfort first the vast majority of guys will go for comfort first that's why what is the vast majority of guys opener hey what's up hey what's up something like that they will often pair this with your beautiful or some sort of over compliment hey what's up you're beautiful and they may also pair it with something we call the purposeless hand of doom which is where they will place their hand on the girls like lower back or arm ok now this in my opinion is garbage fucking crap if you're doing any of these things and you're like not advanced already please stop doing it try to do something a little more creative because there immediately it's not so bad in and of itself but what is happening is in her mind it causes her to immediately slot you into the category of a regular guy 90% of whom get blown the fuck out so now you're just playing with this statistical roulette essentially so I then what will they do so they do that hey you're beautiful what's up then it goes into what so what's your name what do you do where do you live the weather has certainly been interesting how about local sports team turpitude where do you live oh did I already asked that one hot so they asked a series of questions ostensibly the idea of them asking these questions is what well they think well before I go for Attraction I should make her comfortable with me once I get her comfortable with me then I can try to take it romantic now where is the erroneous thinking here why does it makes sense on paper if you don't have a lot of experience approaching women but what what yeah no cheese there you're going to like hey you can have me completely yeah and then you know they're like well so you're sort of like immediately putting yourself there putting her on a pedestal if you will and you're also qualifying yourself in some way okay I agree with that additionally and I would say that when you do it would be akin to a homeless person coming up to you or not even a homeless person just a random person on the street let's say you're walking down the street you're on your lunch break downtown you're walking down the street and some random person comes up here says hey man how's it going oh hey what's up hey what's your name where do you live what do you do for work it's like I don't like this from the fucking uber guy asked me to shit just like play the music just shut up let me need peace but like some stranger on the street it's like who the fuck are you why are you asking me these weird questions I don't want you to have this information you don't I mean I there's no reason for me to be giving you this information it doesn't make sense so that's that's kind of the erroneous thing so it immediately has puts the girls on this like okay another one of these guys asking me all these weird questions so what we do is we flip the script in us in the sense that we go for attraction first so I'll open typically would like a self-amusing opener something that makes me laugh not them necessarily hopefully but like not necessarily it's not important you know so I'll go up you know what one that I like to use a lot is good evening on the next idiot of the night speaking with you or am I the first do I have the honor of being the first fucking idiot tonight here how do they do it you're beautiful well so that's how they do it they look that's why that's such a great opener because it's showing a meta awareness of what the other guys are doing like I'm not like these other cretins right so all open with that I mean there's a variety of others I like hi and I invented tacos hi my name is sage I'm a professional mermaid you know any just out land there's like weird stuff that kind of makes me giggle it makes me laugh so I'm putting myself in the state I want her to be in so that's so that's the thing swing through the open right that's the biggest thing the old 90/10 rule you guys familiar with that ancient concept from the early days of pickup where but you have ideas until you reach the hook point where she goes from thinking who is this person why is he speaking to me to okay this person is interesting funny cool let's continue speaking to him which can happen instantaneously or can take up to a couple of minutes but until you hit that point you are responsible for 90% of the content so a lot of new guys will see you go up and I'll give me I'll even give him an over let's say I give him a funny opener and the girls like ahahaha and then he's just like he's like opener he was like hot and he's like and then the girls like okay wolf and you know just her so she's like not going to contribute it'd be again going back to our man-on-the-street example maybe if a guy comes up here on the street it's like hey man how's it going oh pretty good he's just like  what are you gonna do like okay now I'm going to hello strange person I don't know allow me to engage you in conversation no you're probably gonna say like well cool man nice to meet you and let's just leave like that was weird so swing through the open take you to the hook point then almost immediately I will start peppering in statements of intent peppering in statements of intent now what does a statement of intent it's simply a verbal statement that says I am here to pursue a romantic encounter with you as opposed to sell you fucking Jesus tires or something I don't even know like the thing is a lot of the look in a club environment the girl probably knows why you're there in a day game environment she might think you're selling Jesus or you're selling something or you're trying to get her to sign a petition or something straight like they don't know in the club they they know why you're there but then when you go up with this like I'm going under the radar with my little weird questions it's like they can't even respect it they're like dude come on just just we both know why you're here why the charade like can we just not you know so you and by the way here's another thing a lot of times when you approach the girl she's excited that a guy came up to her like somewhat competently or even not competently for that matter because they can't do the approach what's what are the limited circumstances with which a woman can is like allowed to approach  but at a club they're not gonna do genders understand peacocking yeah so if I'm wearing some garish article of clothing she can now come up and say this thing's crazy right it's giving her an excuse to open it a guy if she finds him attractive you know lingering in the vicinity doing outlandish behavior I mean but but again it's very limited so she might be excited that you approached but then you're like approach and this is like oh and then he goes into these questions and never takes it to the next level and I can see it cuz I see it on the boot camps I see the women's faces they're like oh and then it becomes like oh  okay another one of the fizzle fizzle fizzle and it fizzles out this is why when I get new guys on the program on the bootcamp often I'll say what do you take your sticking point is they're like I can approach but it just fizzles out and that's this is why because they're not realizing the onus is on them to take it to the next level it's not just go up and hope the chick thinks you're hot and fucking sucks your balls in a hot tub like it's it it's on you it's on you to take it there so I'll start layering in and again like I said I start layering in them them in I'm not like damn girl what's that pussy smell like like I'm not I'm not saying that  unforgiveable I'm not I'm not saying that off the bat I'll start with something about very innocuous I'll be like yeah but a lot like bullshit with her for a little bit social hook points I'm a damn well you know you your appearance is rather fetching this evening are you involved in the fashion industry in some capacity perhaps it's like no I love your look it's hot anyway like I was saying during dinner to talk about normal shit like five five five by vibe and by the way what's finding just shooting the shit keeping it fun and then I'll pepper in another one like it's kind of a weird question but were you guys hot are you like a nerd then became hot like in high school are you the fucking ugly duckling and now you'd like blossom and the glorious Swan is that is that what's going on here Sarah it's cool I accept you anyway the guy was I was in academic decathlon I was a fucking nerd myself still AM but anyway blah blah blah blah blah and there so then I take it and I just it off that immediately it sound like you're hot what do you think what do you think by putting pressure on her it's a psycho dude it's almost like subliminal she's like did he just sing on to the next and now she's internalized that meter she's gonna stay there and listen or she's gonna fuck off then I started layering in the physicality so again once I start later I started ramping it up and then it's like I want to ask um will kiss your pussy I want to suck my own dick but that's not really a statement of attack so it becomes it becomes increasingly more explicit over the course of say 10 15 minutes and then she's like okay this dude is clearly here to romance me and then I start layering in the physicality you know the prom dance the fucking thing kiss her on the neck kiss her on the mouth and once I get to mouth kiss now which will should take roughly 15 sometimes still no sooner but as a rule of thumb 15 20 maybe 30 minutes tops at that point any more than that you're likely spinning your wheels but after that now okay it's established it's a man to woman romantic thing it's it's been it's cemented now I can chill back and now I can ask her the questions because now she has a reason to want to answer the questions because she's invested now as opposed to this Rando asking we do live what do you do god it's just so upsetting yes  I look I say that it smote the push if you will is mostly conveyed through the demeanor right it's just this man it's not like an active push it's just more like a board like like just kind of bemused like could take it or leave it like would like to fucker does certainly doesn't need to like the vibe is sort of like I like you I'd like to pursue this and I'm putting myself in the middle space and giving her the space to meet me in the middle as opposed to oh come on come on come on come on come on right so it's very max girls that the hot guy blase you sort of have this blasé attitude about it that allows her to meet you in the middle it doesn't crowder which causes her to become like defensive again it's sort of a sort of an abstract concept you want to like put yourself in that middle space and just like a letter to meet you there that's the push now beyond that if she I'll give pushes if she's kind of like not being super compliant but she still unless she's on the fence right like a missus chick that just fucking hates me and thinks I'm a fucking idiot like I'm not even a bother doing a push because it's pointless it just seems like but her pussy shit at that point however if she's kind of like on the fixed like I don't know I'll be like you know what I wasn't ooh you now I'm not fuck you and then I'll be like you know I like it like so kind of stuff like that I've also done like you know little pushes like I'm not gonna sell you on it you know stuff like dad even like oh man and everything was going so well god damn it and I'm just gonna have to go home and cry in the darkness looking at a candle and listening to Lionel Richie putting cigarettes out on my dick like like I do every night my entire dick the balls it's just one big cigarette burn it looks like fucking Freddy Krueger's dick nightmare a dick Street it's like what so again but I've also done one I remember once I was in New Orleans and it was the end of the night it's like a very hard but it's like well the hardest work I've ever done we wrapped like Pat O'Brien's or something like total shit show like Mardi Gras and I have this girl and I get her outside it's kind of like winding down like the nights winding down like yo let's get out of here and she's like I have to tell my friends I can't leave my friends like the whole I can't leave my friends and I'm like looking at the time here I'm like this is winding down if I don't pull this I got a you know I'm I'm in dire straits so I might look tie your friends to go or I'm gonna go pull another bitch and she goes oh oh you mean oh you mean like you pulled me I'm like yes yes exactly like that and she's like fine and I'm like holy shit I can't believe that woman like internally I'm like I mean that's like a Hail Mary dude I mean I was like this is done I mean but that's the thing he was going to be done regardless so it's like okay well may as well attempt to this ridiculous maneuver yeah such a broad question but I wanted to ask you how do you choose what to focus on in your life because doing a relationships spirituality career and everything there's a lot that things got to be done well in life but I feel like there's also enough concrete information out there to know what to do but as soon as you focus on that I kind of realized that I'm not doing the others as well as I could be so how do you choose what to put your well that's really that's really like a time management question and I'd say you know the analogy that I've heard best describes this is the idea of like your life being like a wheel with different spokes and so the spokes each represent one of those areas you mentioned so there are examples spirituality fitness your finances dating etcetera and center of family relationships whatever and if if you draw if you were to draw them out in the length of the spoke each you know each spoke length being represented by how much effort you're putting into that if it's all out of whack that wheel is not gonna run right it's gonna be a clunk clunk clunk clunk right so you you really need to two things number one dig deep and really I how old are you so you're 18 right so you have stay in school do your homework so you have I had this uh.this check on unhinge yesterday I don't like blah blah let's go on a romantic date she's like I don't think you'd want to do that I'm like why what's wrong with you she's like I'm actually 14 I'm like I said gross and then she said lol thanks I'm like well stay in school do your homework don't do drugs so but but no so the thing is with a with a youthful person if I could go back in time to my you know younger self and get they don't part some advice not that they not that he'd listen to it but you know cuz people need to make their own mistakes but I wish I could I would have been more thoughtful about my identity right I put more thought into like the person that the values I wanted to embody so that's a big part of it and that'll kind of like help guide your path if you will you shouldn't just be like very haphazard about it like I was a very angry person back then and you know my early 20s very very like rage filled like nihilistic and I I think that helped me to some extent like anger can be useful it can be motivating but it was like almost like there's a defining aspect of my personality and I didn't want to let it go so you have to look specifically at areas of your personality that are disempowering like parts of your identity that are disempowering and start to cut those out that can be difficult because it's your identity and even if it's a part of your identity that sucks and is actually hurting you well it's still a part of your identity and it feels like cutting out like a piece of yourself Eve even though you know on a logical level that's not helping so I haven't more thoughtful about that now two great programs and I would recommend you look into for like just time management that helped me a great deal we're number one Anthony Robbins time of your life and so again it's really about time management and like building up that balance in your life consciously through a variety of life strategies he lays out and then what was the David d1 wake up productive I found that was really good time management so I think essentially what you're asking if you know two people say that you can have like one hobby or two hobbies because most people they have to go up you know wake up go to work do their work and then after before and after work you have time to maybe like go to the gym if you want to do gym or if you want to do like some other sport or some other activity you have time for that maybe on the weekend you know so again time is very limited in fact I always say it's the only commodity that we really have so you want to be very again thoughtful about how you're spending your time and I think I got those are just those will set you count on the like right mental track like just to get an idea of how you want to start going about that yeah the bag congratulations [Applause]  okay all right so parking I assumed there's a part two but what you said earlier about their baseball son changing instead of money I hold on to the persona of how I respect women I want to if I were to fuck you in a dirty way that it would be disrespectful to you well what's it what is a dirty way  yeah what's a dirty way it's the I understand on one level that given certain circumstances girls want to be treated in that Highway I'm not understanding you didn't answer the question what is a dirty way just being very good right being like sayings and instead of trying to do the question game saying I know you wanna fuck I wanna okay well so I think a couple there's a couple things I'm saying that that spring out of me right here number one is look you're saying it's like either a I go up and I'm like nice guy under the radar question man or B I'm like well so bitch you want to fuck like your this is not not this is a false dichotomy right think it's a continuum it's not like this or this these are the only two options so like I said I'm layering it in almost imperceptibly so they're like oh now he's saying this then it's mild and now he's saying this it's medium and now we say this is it's spicy right so you're kicking it up like incrementally and that allow sort of get acclimated to it that's what makes it smooth as opposed to jerky and awkward and putting around the spot and creepy so that's number one number two is you do not know what she perceives to be dirty or creepy you are speculating and you are putting some narrative that you've created your head up like this a Madonna whore thing where you're like girls think this like you do not know what an individual person thinks for example I could look at a girl and you know she looks like this little goody two-shoes and then I take her back to my house she's like fists me in the bass hole bitch and I'm like wait what it's like do it pussy I'm like right conversely she could look like some you know fucking thought from hell like she's you know dressed like a total slut or whatever quote-unquote like very promiscuous and you get homesick oh not in the first night you know you have no fucking idea so you're you're speculating so the real thing that you want to do is stop speculating and find out and this means you're not again just like powerbombing them with your dick that is almost as bad as the nice guy shit right I don't even know which is worse I mean probably the power bottom with the dick butt huh but but the thing is even the power bottom with a dick it's easier to almost like dial back like okay this shit's too creepy I see that usually when I go up like this it looks they get a poor reaction dial it back verses to teach you got balls you know how do you teach balls that's that's quite difficult I'll tell you how I teach balls though emotional leverage if you get him to here nice to meet you enough and then they're gonna try to push it then the thing is like for the guy who's been in his whole life just asking these lame questions when I tell him to I push it as hard as you can he's gonna be like dressed like that to him oh he's going crazy right so it's gonna happen if or mentally for him but like play around with it,AbZ5U-q1CbI
oh boy so what books am i reading lately I'm reading I'm gonna grab this real quick that's called liquid intelligence by Dave Arnold and what this is about it's about cocktails and this guy yeah he investigates temperature carbonation sugar concentration and acidity in search of ways to invigorate classic cocktails so this guy is like years and years of study there's actually 28 pages on ice just on ice you know it talks about refractometers pH meters centrifuges liquid nitrogen dry ice  carbon dioxide vacuum machine roto rotor rotary evaporators I really want to get a rotary evaporator or a rotovap as it's known however the bad part is they cost like 10 grand it costs 10 grand to get a rotovap and I don't have 10 grand flying around right now I wish you were my dad says John X Chino I wish I had a dad so my dad sucks as well my dad died last month and it was it came as quite a shock because I you know I hadn't spoken to him in 25 years and I'd never had a good relationship with him after what happened when I was a you know 15 if you were in my book you know we went to prison and I hadn't seen him for 25 years and kind of interestingly enough he when I didn't do not be sorry to hear it and if anything I'm glad because now he can't come back and do more weird shit to us but in reality parents we're just born to these random shows you know and it's just kind of a roll of the dice I happen to get a pretty a lot of other people did not have such a thing but you know a lot of other people had worse you know maybe they were born in a war zone or they're born to a fucking leg that their dad fucks him in the asshole or something like that or Bern is then or something you know uh my dad he was never like abusive or any shit like that until he he just snapped and you know everything happened and bla bla bla but um you know thinking about it ultimately you got to understand he's just a random person you know he's just a random person of of seven billion people who had a kid you know and he probably tried to do the best that he could give in you know the paradigms he knew and the way his brain functioned and you know your parents you don't you know you you choose how to relate to them right it's not up to you whether to forgive them for any perceived slights that they did or not you know again they're just there's fucking people man and you can you choose the meaning to give to it and that's kind of like the way I've come to think about it over the years and and so forth and you know it's interesting because to think like you know 25 years ago if you would have told me like this I mean it sucked it felt when that should happened it felt like being on fire all the time all the time now I get if you read my book just really briefly to go over with it what happened was essentially my mom told him that she was breaking up with them and getting filing for divorce and she was seeing some other guy lost his she had kidnapped them and did all this fucking hairy shit to him at gunpoint and got sent away for eight years to Supermax State Penitentiary California State Penitentiary at Pelican Bay and I was a you know I was fifteen I was an honor student straight-a student and have you had happened was like having the rub just just pulled out from under me and I went from a straight-a student to like straight D student in one semester started like making bomb in the garage and doing fucking acid and then pot and drinking and other shit and because you know the thing is it's like when something like that happens it's like school are you fucking kidding me go home homework fuck out of here with that shit that doesn't matter none of this shit matters it doesn't matter and so yeah I just became very nihilistic I mean I I'm again I'm surprised I graduated high school I think that they I think they feel bad for me because you know was in the papers and everything they knew I was a good student before and obviously that really influenced the way that I view the world and it influenced the way I interact with society and shit like that and you know a lot of people wonder why I'm you know maybe the way I I am why I am you know so cavalier with the way I interact with the world and shit like that and I used to be a nihilist but you know now again I this is 25 years ago now you know more of an absurdist at best now and you learn how to deal with the shit and you learn how to what it means you know and it the the meaning is largely what you give it now of course when that happened like I said it felt like being unmoored from reality right like literally at the dinner table the SWAT team kicks in the door arrests your father saying you did all these things like what what the fuck is going on I mean it seems like a movie you know it seems like a dream and every morning I would wake up and I would think oh maybe it'll be it's it's not gonna be that is I'm gonna wake up it's gonna be back to before and I'm gonna be in my bed and I'm my dad's gonna be my mom and you know it's gonna be the same tense environment like it was it was some awesome guy I mean he never committed a crime before in his life I never even had a parking ticket he was a corporate executive I he'd just snapped he was he was always kind of like an emotionally abusive dick but nothing too crazy you know just kind of a jerk you know so I thought I'd wake up and just like back to that and it'll be fine but no every morning you wake up and it's still happening and again it felt like like the way I put it was like felt like being on fire all the time and that you can't and I would literally put my head through through the wall to make it hurt less and my mother was terrified of me not like talking about it now those days she's like Jeff you were like a fucking wild animal you were I was completely terrified of you and I would try to set the house on fire and all this shit I mean dude if that shit went down now with social media and shit I would definitely be in jail so thank God that should happen in like the early 90s before like fucking internet you know at one point she kicked me out of the house I just sleep in a shed in the yard and I'd be like up on the roof pouring shit down the chimney I was like a out of like a like a feral animal and I gotta say and I I think that a lot of people they it's funny to see how people are reacting to this whole like Trump thing you know Donald Trump being the president because there's literally nothing has ever happened like this in in most people's life in anyone's lifetime you know we're an internet troll like a celebrity BK an internet troll is the fucking president and so I remember especially watching the second debate and seeing them snark at each other and shit like that you know like like two fucking sorority sisters that hadn't spoken to each other since Becky made out with Amanda's boyfriend at the fucking bar and like wrong wrong you know it is just so surreal and I I remember like my roommate like crying and saying this isn't real this doesn't really like and and then now it's happened now he's elected and it isn't real and it was kind of the same feeling of being again unmoored from reality like is this fucking real is this fucking real and I think you know I've I'm like I remember this feeling I've dealt with this before but I think a lot of people and simply have never had a you know had have never had that experience before and that's why you see these people like in the streets the protests and the crying and shit like they there it's like yeah welcome to my world bitches welcome to what I've like felt for the past 25 fucking so it's good I think it's good I think it brings people to understand me a little better how they know what it's like good motherfuckers how does it feel to have some cognitive dissonance up your ass but yeah I mean it is what it is life goes on I mean like I said in that if you seen that trump video you know you know he's not the Emperor you know it's not like he has unlimited powers there's checks and balances and so forth and who knows what's gonna fucking happen I you know who fucking knows I mean let's wait and see we'll wait and see but let's see tell us about your bucket list the bucket list I mean like honestly I kind of feel like louis c.k where I'm just like you know when there's an old joke he did where he's like he's like you know when you're young when you're 20 you're like I hope my life's like a long story and all this amazing stuff happens and and so on and so forth but when you're my age you're like it's almost I'm almost there man one was done and he said this shit almost over it seems like this is taking a long fucking time man you know so I mean I've been everywhere I've fucking done I've had a full life you know if I were to die tomorrow I would be pretty happy about it I would just request that someone delete my browser history and I think I'm gonna make a app don't steal this if anyone's listening I'm gonna make an app where it automatic it's like a biometric thing and it detects if you die and if you die or your flatlines or whatever it deletes your browser history across all your devices so you know your your fan your friends and family won't see your black gay midget porn you have been jacking off too feverishly and furiously all day and all night what would I like to see in the world I'd like to see what I'd like to specifically see in San Francisco would be them to get fucking poutine right here and that's been pissing me off for quite a while and you know that it seems like okay samples to the huge culinary town we do things very well but the one thing they can't seem to get right is fucking poutine man every time I get a poutine here it's like it's like fuck it okay so they get that they have the gravy the fries the meat but then they have like melted shredded cheese I'm like what the what the fuck is this it's supposed to be cheese curds it's fucking curds okay it's not shredded melted cheese motherfuckers okay and this is something I get quite angry about and you know I just hope one day they can get it right and oh look fickle sweet puppy wants to leave now fuck in or out dude is there any chance you sell your hot seat I'm not sure what that means I'm assuming that you mean that I put it out like as a digital product to download or watch it on the Internet is that what we're asking here yeah so I'm thinking about doing that once I have accumulated enough footage for like a brand new hot seat then I'll put out then I'll put out the old stuff I may I may actually start doing that I don't know I mean I've been doing a lot of work this past couple years so I'm kind of lazy right now the next product that I'm doing I'm working on this right now and it's going to be a product about vocal projection and vocal training now obviously I'm not an expert in this you know field but I I would say this you know my voice is rather powerful you know I've trained it over many years and I know how to use the apparatus in order to project and not have it cut out at the by the end of the night and cut through music and talk on stage and stuff of that nature so here's the thing I'm doing I'm actually bringing in an excuse me bring in a professional opera singer and we're constructing various exercises that are designed specific they're designed specifically for pickup and just just powerful speaking in general and you'll be able to go through it and like do these exercises and you'll be it's something you'll be able to engage with every day to to train and it's gonna be pretty cheap this is gotta be one of those like you know the next $500 fucking RSD product you know I want this to be something that people can can pick up and you know have it have a good time way than and really enjoy for a relatively cheap price point okay hold on the doorbell that's probably Amazon  it'll grab that tinder boost have I tried this no I have not tried it I don't need to try that stuff I have way more matches than I can even deal with at this point but um one thing I would highly recommend would be to get it's called tinder flames and it only works for iPhone so I'm going to Android and what it does is it it trolls all the matches all the tinder chicks and it it picks out the ones that swiped on you so you don't have to swipe anymore no swiping needed you just open up you know each morning you open up your tinder flames and it shows you all the girls have swiped on you and you can accept or decline it's called tinder flames like I said it's for iOS it's fucking awesome it'll save it yeah it'll save mass amounts of time I mean I use I use every what do you call I use literally every fucking app out there I use  you know fuck when I bumble tinder happen coffee meets bagel OkCupid shit I only want a hint the only one I don't use is fucking a plenty of fish that's like disgusting I think that's universally recognized as the most grotesque dating app out there it's like plenty of ratchet fucking East Bay hoes from like Vallejo who would like to kill you what's this shit Jeffy do you play clash of clans on iOS 10 no I do not play any video games I do not waste time on that shit I I wish I could I honestly wish I had time to play video games because you know it would be great great to do that like to fuck around and I hear a lot of good things there's a lot of great games out but I just wanted time man I'm too fucking busy with you know being a grown man and making fucking money and you know doing you know banging shit I I literally don't fuck around with that shit what music do I listen to I'm right currently I've been on repeat blasting the new Tribe Called Quest I what does it call it's like it's called thanks for your service we got it from here it's a it's a great fucking album it's a little on the nose in places I think especially like the track we the people you know it's like  what does it say it's like all all all you black folks you must go all you Mexicans you must go Muslims and gays boy we hate your ways a little on the nose but you know whatever I mean that it's musically very good it's just like imaginative classic tribe was just updated to 2016 that's what it is it's like tribe at their best doing what they do best which is good it's very good you know if you're expecting something different or them to branch out musically there's not a whole hell of a lot of that on it you know it's the same kind of like-- melodic jazzy samples the you know the rapping is good busta rhymes is on there there's like a Kanye piece there's uh there's a lot it's amazing so I yeah check it out that tribe that's right listen listen ooh right now I'd say holidays there is a bit of a drop-off for pickup because people you know they're doing the holiday thing they're traveling they're going to their family however it can be it can be good they're like there's like a hidden twist on the holidays like for example last week the week of Thanksgiving I on Friday I actually I got laid from tinder and she was she drove up she was like in I don't know she was in the South Bay or something she drove up and I was like oh so you live here so like no I live in you know back east I was like well why are you here you here on family she's like yeah I'm here for family I just wanted to get the fun but you just wanted to get the fuck away from your family for like a night didn't you and she's like yeah yeah because here's the thing people that they visit their family but you know everyone can only handle their family and small doses usually so they're like shit I got to get the fuck out of this house and like so you can kind of mop those up like if you go out to the bars on Christmas night Christmas Eve or whatever Thanksgiving those times you will find people there like probably out with their cousins and they're like the younger people in the family they're like okay let's let's hit the bar to kind of get away from the elders and the parents and stuff like that so you know it's a bit of a mixed bag on the holidays but yeah I wouldn't notice there is definitely a dip so if you're noticing kind of a dip in your game over the holidays I would say don't beat yourself up over it don't get worried you know it's it's par for the course so what's this guy so someone asks if you were to live in one place for hookups don't look at this shit not a good idea to get flu shots Jeffie vaccines cause autism vaccines cause autism and the fucking pizza gate make sure you check out Pizza Gate Hillary Clinton's fucks little boy fucks little children I read about it on on Facebook vaccines as autism the world's flat the clintons go to a pedophile island and heat pizza at pedophile island do you get recognized by girls as the infamous rst Jeffie how do they react do they care okay last week I I hooked up with a guy a guy I hooked up some dude and it was fucking the shit bro no I so laughs last uh what the fuck muscle man last Wednesday last Tuesday before I went to Philly I hooked up with a girl on tinder and we went back to my place and so I'm coming back from Philly yesterday and I was on the airplane and I was on the internet on the airplane you know miracles of modern technology and ding I get a text and it's from the girl who I hooked up with and she says this yesterday 6:20 p.m. I know who you are now so what do you think my response is to that let's take it take a guess what do you a girl says I know who you are now what's my response oh shit no that wasn't my response oh shit was not my response  no guesses no one want to hazard a guess a sexy bastard no I did not say that I never brag on myself because it's so glaringly obvious that to say that would be a moot point something super dickish nope I don't do that shit no mo I learned my lesson I'm Jeff cool this is what I responded didn't the word oh that's it Oh  aluminum and mercury is found in vex you fuck you you fucking vaccine cunt stop it with this vaccine shit keep this shit off my fucking periscope I don't see his shit don't want to see it so I said oh that is what I respect like any time that some girl says something that's like not fucking you know beneficial to me or could be misinterpreted I don't know and here's the point she's like I know who you are now that that's not good or bad you know maybe she thinks it doesn't maybe she thinks I'm a fucking cretin but if I like respond like will do to do to dirt like I might shoot myself in the foot I think oh is a great response like oh because it's like it shows you received it and then it's I puts kind of the ball back in her court to respond so I'm like oh and so she says I figured it out Jeff Allen and I respond okay that's it okay dot dot dot and then so she then says pickup artist huh I'm just fascinated so again I'm not gonna like assume that one thing that I've learned in pickup is you never want to try to assume what they're thinking no don't try to infer what others are thinking don't jump to conclusions based on your own biases about what other people are thinking or what they believe or what the responses are gonna be like or how you know what their motivations are because look you're not a fucking clairvoyant you don't know what these people are thinking it's best to just stay in your lane amplify your own solid communication and don't be in reaction you know again that's ultimately what I think the core message of RSD is is being at the cause under things-they environment not the effect end because there's so many influences that are pushing us into our head there's so many societal conditioning conditionings that are happening over the course of our life that cause us when we you know you know wouldn't we interact with others to go to feel threatened to want to protect the little me right the the little me like I hope they think I'm cool I hope they like me do they like me is people is is people looking at me I hope they think I'm cool so look again you have to learn and it takes a lot it takes a lot to crack this shit off man I mean we've look I interact with the society I interact with it in my own way I have to interact with a society we're social creatures but I interact with it in my own way and par that comes from again those experiences I had young when I was younger that that colored the way that I interact you know in kind of this very devil-may-care way but you know obviously something were grounded and mature now but you know even with all that you're still you're still influenced in countless ways countless ways and so we've cracked you know if you look at myself Tyler Julian max we've cracked those influences off over a period of many years and they still affect us and when I go out the difference is between between us and most other people is that would we see those things affecting us when we feel that social pressure affecting us we feel that conditioning that poison dripping as Tyler calls it when we feel that stuff beginning to affect us in the field quote-unquote we are able to recognize it and we've also developed a variety of methods and tools to begin to push it back right to push back push our energy back on it and not get stuck into those traps and you know and get stuck into our head and pushed in your head quote unquote and again really that's in my opinion what rst is all about that's the ultimate message of artists D you know the pickup shit they're getting laid that's like the icing on the cake obviously it cake kind of sucks without icing so that is an important in important part of it but you know it's really about becoming more grounded and and being at the E in the driver's seat of your life as opposed to just reacting to shit you know Tyler the classic Tyler of quote is people most people go through life in a walking days just reacting to stuff as it happens at the whim of the again not just not just the societal conditioning but also the biological drives and the chemical reactions in your brain and shit of that nature and ultimately you know we can't escape that entirely that's never gonna happen but like I said it's important to learn how to recognize when this is happening to you and then begin to develop ways to push back right and of course you know this is what we teach at hotsy you know the hotseat transformational experience the I think the transfer the videos are great you know coming velocity watching videos of high-level pickup ak8 what does that mean just guys who've been do it in a very long time professionally and you you know if you watch those videos I think one of the things that teaches you is that you could like you watch the videos you're like these guys aren't doing anything that I couldn't be doing right now they're not like you know it's not like the NBA where there's some barrier to entry where it's like I don't care how much I want to be a fucking player in the NBA it ain't happening it's not happening my dream of NBA superstardom is not happening because I'm fucking 41 and I'm five foot seven and I'm white you hadn't you hadn't noticed translucent right so that shouldn't happen it'd be but anyone can do this anyone you might say well you know I'm an Asian I'm an Indian I'm I have a racial thing I'm short I have a de for me dude I know so many fucking Indian dudes who were fucking slaying ass I don't so many fucking dudes who have deformities shout out to my boy Jason in fucking Los Angeles this dude he's got cerebral fucking palsy dawg he's walking around on fucking like look dude like like fucking Walter jr. from Breaking Bad and this guy's one of the biggest pimps I fucking I seen he's out gang stirring it up man gang string it up in the fucking like top venues in LA you know quite an inspiration that that dude and there's so many more like it's so it's like again point being there is no barrier to entry to this so when you watch those videos at the hot seat you're like I could do this and it looks super fun these guys are having so much fun with it you know I think there's many ways to look at pick up one is like some people do too scary and that makes sense when it's confusing at the beginning and everything but these days you know it's just fun to me man this is like our favorite hobby you watch these videos it's like unbridled joy unbridled fucking joy you know it's like going to the skate park sometimes you land the trick sometimes eat shit but the end of the day you leave with your buddies and you're like that was a great great session you know you're taking er it's about the joy of taking action right and so that you know when you watch this videos you get all that you get the contacts and you get the techniques but still I noticed people were going out and they weren't able to execute and the reason is these emotional blocks that are in place from the social conditioning etc you can even know exactly what to do and they cannot execute because they get put their head I mean how many of you experienced that where you know logically you've read the theory you've watched the fucking videos you know what the structure of a pickup should be but then you out to the field and you're just like you start talking but you're like right you you're just like fucking shut down you go blank I've been there we all fucking been there man if you saw us 10 15 years ago again you'd have no doubt that you could do anything that we do because we were fucking psychos now we're coming from like severe emotional deficit most people aren't so we had to struggle through two but you know bottom line that's why we reinstituted the the transformational experience aspect with the exercises and these are exercises that you know we're evolving them with almost every iteration of the program of the hot seat and you know several hours and it's you know obviously it's my favorite part of it it's my favorite part you know cuz I've seen these videos a billion times and you know the funny thing is I can watch my videos a hundred times and every time I laugh at them you know because I think I'm hilarious and that's a big part of being good at pickup is like legit believing you're hilarious right but um but I you know it's just it is just kind of passive sitting there and then the same thing over and over week in and week out but the exercises are always different you know they're all they're different every every time you know a different new weird shit happens every time so just did it in Philly it was a small crowd man there's only like you know 20 guys there and which man I wasn't even making that much money but you know what fuck it if I step to the stage I don't care if there's fucking three people in that room I'm gonna run it cuz this is what I fuckin do this is my fucking job man and I think I truly believe that I'm one of the best in the world at teaching this shit and it's a special thing to be the best at something it's a special thing and that's why I won't quit this shit no matter how much the travel gets wears me down no matter how many students are insane and try to murder me in a hotel room yeah that actually happened no matter how no matter how many times like I get frustrated with the guys in the field and and this and that and the next thing I'm gonna quit because I suck so much opportunity cost into this and I'm gonna stick with it because I love it it's what I do it's what I'm good at find something you're fuckin good at and continue to do it you know I'm saying tell the murder story alright you want to hear the murder story alright I'll tell the fucking murder story and that's it then we done here so I went to  Atlanta recently here's the scene it's me and this one guy me and this one guy all weekend so I meet him and he's a bit of a strange fellow you know a very intense it's very intense guy so this guy he knows like combat right he know he's a combat guy he knows Krav Maga and he's like that's what he does he he teaches that shit and he and he's like you know that's a that's a shit that's his fucking job so anyway we go out in the first night and he's very frightening to the girls he's like very intense he's like hey girls hey Kurt like he's like grabbing him being like Vasudev sessions about to start in ten seconds which I actually thought was a very funny opener but the way he said it was like very frightening so these girls like holy shit this dude's fuck this dude it's fucking frightening right so I'm like dude okay this is gonna be a long weekend man so I'm like holy shit this guy is very tense and I realized it's just me and this guy that BFF BFF all weekend so on the second night he was the third night I don't I don't know what one of the nights he comes in and he uh he he's in the hotel right I decided let's pre-brief in my hotel room you know cuz it's like it's quiet you know it's chill we can have like some privacy and shit so I'm he comes in and the first thing he says he's like I'm very upset about last night I'm like oh what's going on laying on me dude he's like I don't feel you're teaching me right I don't feel I'm gonna do what the fuck I'm like what the fuck is this shit dude I'm giving you the basic program like that I give everyone and I'm tailoring it to you he's like no man I don't know man I'm just I don't know man I don't know what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck I don't know man hey come here Jeff here come here Jess come here Jeff and he's like getting in my fucking grill I'm like sitting in this chair he's like getting in my fucking girl pacing back and forth manically screaming and I'm like dude I'm like what are you doing man he's like I don't know man you're a badass I'm not badass I don't want the fuck's going on all right what the fuck what the fuck what the fuck and it strikes me I realize that nobody knows I'm here nobody knows I'm here in the room with this guy and he's like this combat dude and he's running back and forth and he's getting like increasingly upset and manic and at this point I'm like frightened for my safety I'm frightened for my fucking safety and I'm like and I put like I start recording it so in case in case he murders me there will be there will be a record of what happened  and I'm like shit what am I gonna do man there's like a whole another night am I do I kick him off the program but I'm like no you're not gonna kick him off the fucking program because I will never kick someone off in 15 years I gotta say I'd probably kicked like two people off the program maybe that's I'm the last resort shit that's the fucking last resort shit man and and the thing is like I think one time when it happened I was talking the guy was like he's kind of being a bitch and I'm like look motherfucker I went to like Sargent asshole mode and I look motherfucker you wanna fucking you want to act like this just leave the program and get a fucking refund get the fuck off the program and you'll know you're a little bitch get the fuck out of here man and he's like okay any leaves I'm like uh shit you weren't supposed to actually leave you're supposed to step up that was supposed to inspire you to step up I'm like oh right so yeah because you know sometimes the sergeant asshole thing will motivate the guy like fuck you Jeff I'll show ya you know like so so I'll almost never take the if' program so here's what I had to do I had to enter his dark world I had to go a hundred percent into his dark world and become his best friend and I coached him a very long ver very long time and very diligently before we even went out I had him rehearse an opener now then again for most guys I would do this but like I'm like let's rehearse one opener we'll do the the next ad end-of-the-night opener and i had to walk out of the bathroom and open like an imaginary girl with this opener and then I would he would say like hello I am the nurse did I talk to you and I'm like no no like this excuse me I'm the next idiot of the night speaking with you or am I the first do I have the honor of having been the first idiot of the night to speak with you oh no probably won't be the last either hey what's up I'm Jeff so I hadn't rehearsed that over and over and over and over until he was able to get a semblance of it coming out and sound normal and I was like okay now we're gonna go out and he did much fucking better girls responded to him he made out with a girl he got a number and shit this and again look with bootcamp III want to set the bar high enough so it's challenging but not so high that it's impossible so you know I think and then the guy after that he went he went off to I believe to immersion and he have success out there and so you know you want to assess where the guys at and take it one step at a time so you know that was the story of the guy who was murdered me and then I saw him it I saw him at some and he's like Jeff huh now I'm like now we are like BFFs and I love that dude he's uh you know went from being terrified I'm still terrified of him a little bit if you're if you're watching this dude you know who you are I'm still fucking terrified of you and we and actually at one point we were like slap boxing because I got pissed at him again at one point in the night I'm like good we ended up like slap boxing in the fucking late-night diner it's all it was all in good fun though you know just just a couple of sweet dudes slapping the shit out of each other in a diner oh boy thanks for watching I'm gonna be popping up on these things a lot more in the near future if you want to know always post on Facebook a little beforehand I'm gonna be up on periscope if you wanna check out hot C and I'm doing one loss and my next one is Los Angeles on January 14th and I'm doing Vancouver a couple weeks after that Houston Texas and cetera et cetera see you next time guys Cheers [Music],AbvVlD1-Yxs
so on a Jeff Julian ed Luke and maybe even some other invisible RC instructors behind the couch from Renault social dynamics we're at the very end of a party that my roommate through at our crib here in the Hollywood Hills at the end of the night right now and so what we thought we would do is talk about the topic of how to pull at the end the night let's say there's 10 minutes left it's clearing out just like just like our party here that we had which is really fun is clearing out and what do you do to meet a girl in those critical last 10 minutes so yeah man we've all been there it's 10 minutes to closing time the lights go up everyone starts to look like Melisandre from the fucking Game of Thrones which case off the ruby necklace but there's a couple cute girls still milling about you're not upset what do you do what do you do like you're fucking Keanu Reeves on a bus in a film speed Dennis hoppers yelling you okay so important thing to understand is there's three different stages to a night generally right there's the beginning of the night what we typically refer to a social mingling time and that's when everyone's just arrived there they're meeting their friends they settled in you know the finding a place is down there getting the first drinks at cetera etc etc now again granted in that first like hour or so is it very like you're going to pull know strange things have happened but they spend 90 minutes getting ready are they going to like like you roll up and then go like go bye ladies we go suck this guy's dick in an alley no probably not so you know you're chilling out then there's the trench time where you start putting in work when everyone's kind of loosened up and then of course there's what we refer to as the twilight zone and that's the time around 1:30 is depending on you know whatever municipality the local laws but like the very end of the night it's starting to peter out no pun intended everyone's going home okay so the basic difference is in my opinion are are these number one your timelines going to be a lot more compression right you can be a lot more aggressive and a lot of guys that I know that have shitty game they rely on was all basically guerrilla game where they just roll up at like 2:30 on the street and there's like Kobe or like scorpion from fucking Mortal Kombat get over here right and the girls like gross you like eventually one girl is going to like that and I had an assistant and this is all this guy would do but here's the issue with that he had no depth you know and so he could get these girls like by just by going by going gorillas he couldn't keep the girl to save his life so a certain point I told him look dude here's your mission for the next like until you get a girl's phone number and go on a date with her and then hook up with her after the date you're not allowed to do anymore the same that poles now that guy then didn't get laid for six months so it may have been detrimental but in any case look is that the best style game no but it is a style of game that's the style game that we're talking about right here right now so again with guerrilla game basically at the end of the night what do I do I'm just going to go at like the scrum where people figuring out the scores are being settled I'm just going to go up to a girl and I'm going to be very direct like normally for me to get to the kiss it might take like up to ten to twenty minutes but at the end of the night it's going to be like five or instantaneous like I'm basically just gonna go up hand of God you who are you oh my god I love you and go for it and she's like a grouse runs away then I'm like you who are you oh my god I'm right and I was like you well just like literally do that until I find with the host and that's pretty much how you want to roll in in that Twilight that's why my time I mean I just like my brain is wired that you're another a free tour or at 3:00 in the morning I get loopy right and that's designed to get them to get myself laughing so much that the girl will start laughing a lot with about three meters like it was to be me we had between you and me like and you and I we don't really drink when we're gaming like when I'm at the game like don't control guys fucking I don't swerve all the time but like when I'm out to a game I don't at the end of the night I want to be sharp because I feel like I've earned my superiority over these animals that are falling on themselves you know the animals okay but but again like so again at the end tonight was like boom boom you're able to see those are the winners are between and go through them and that's another big key to like pulling and he's like Twilight times is remaining on point you know and not getting off office were a sloppy motherfucker yeah I get I get downright like like it's like the sharp loopiness where I've got the girl laughing so much like me and Luke will practice that a lot of a three-word I feel like I'm an inventor into the night mic and hit5 urged and now it's my time to shine I mean we do we do this like like you'll see me looking free to it and we'll just literally clown and clown and clown a clown and like some guys like wait a minute what so just could outing where's the Leslie is the lesson it's like what do you think that we're doing to pull home studying women at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning we're like James Bond hi-yah measure no would you like to come home for intercourse like good evening I'm Chinese and I love balls balls balls both like literally balls balls balls what's more likely to work like good evening my name is Jeff I I have I spent ten years building a brand and I'm relatively successful and I travel the world I'd love for you to shadow in the end possibly be my girlfriend that or hi I'm Chinese and I'm a bald like well above your well above but it was it what's more likely to work I love balls why I feel it working me right now at some of the ball okay I'm getting attracted I mean I do love balls all variety basketballs footballs whatever but like nerf balls but whatever the point being it's low investment and it doesn't put pressure on you know especially exam fight who fucking want to hear in this fucking shit at the end of a night yeah guys want game to be what they wish it would be and you know why because they don't know how that they don't know how to let loose they don't know how to go into abundance so they wish it didn't work like that they wish that the classy girls didn't respond to like these fun outgoing things but she has conditioned thinking the conditioned thing he says don't go home with a guy through the mornings met so when you get out of your condition thinking you pull her out of conditioned thinking and then basically she goes home with you and she had sex and it becomes a big joke the more of a joke that it is the more that these bad things are no big deal you almost want to be like a human drug dream it's a dream yeah one thing I just add in terms like the strategy here is if it's the end of the night don't be too stubborn in terms of just pulling the girl be willing a lot of times to go with her you know it's like she's there with her friends most likely she's going home that's when you're gonna be able to you know put in your time it is your reality she should just immediately stop put down everything she's doing go with you because you're the alpha male you're you don't want to be some greedy little fuck following her back yeah if you have that pick up series but you get laid it doesn't even count because it is a very sacrifice all result to stick to a general series that you heard from guys who joined us in 2008 that's true I mean if you can pull her it's obviously better because we get logistics when you're control it's a lot more predictable but again you don't have a lot of time like 10 minutes left you don't have that much time usually one of enough to be like leave your friends comply to all of this so in that case go with her okay you don't lose anything by going with her and it buys you more time and don't be afraid to she lives far away you know one thing I would do this is in Berlin so it's the end of the night on boot camp I make the guys open like in the fucking tackling liner what's the opener it's like hey what are you

"yo yo yo what up it's a proverbial uncle uncle J here with your proverbial father father J aka Shirley on brittle and today we're here in Las Vegas Nevada and what we want to bring you is a special missive of love from the heavens what we want to talk about today are three absolute game killers these are things that will stop you even before you get to the starting line right is it gonna set you ten feet behind the starting line in the race of game and things to avoid at all costs if you want to succeed feel like pause you just did get over it do you guys sense authenticity on these channels you know my channel his channel we're bringing actual wisdom from the trenches this isn't just stuff where we're posted up you know behind some backdrop in our in our home talking out of our ass to get like the cheap mainstream views here this is the real talk so if you're interested in that stuff take a moment if you would to please like and subscribe hit these little buttons below like and subscribe so you can get this stuff brought to your attention every Tuesday every Taco Tuesday ok so now that that's out of the way let's get to the first game killer that first thing that's actually gonna kill your game and it's this you've got to kill your ego if you want to give up the stuff you've got to be able to subsume these base desires to protect yourself from negative outcomes right the the get out of the defensive little knee and get into the expansive self that's gonna be able to bring the party so to speak and that's gonna be able to bring a vibe to people that isn't gonna make them shut you down right off the bat so you want to talk a little bit about that in more depth yeah I mean it's crazy like we all tend to think we're gonna figure out on our own you know that's a Kure go like you got this you're gonna figure out on your own you don't gotta challenge any beliefs you don't gotta challenge your identity who you are right now your little ego let's just find a way to make it work you can do this and that's not true ok you got to stop on that shit right fucking and put your ego aside take the mic off a second take your shirt off  [Applause]  now you can hold the mic up to your mouth just notice you know that fear people have been naked in front of the the school it's pretty much here everyone's seen your body judging your body Neri what's going on I mean let me ask you this if you were quote-unquote smart enough to figure this shit out on your own you would have already if you spent a lot of time a lot of energy already going out trying to internalize this knowledge watching videos studying this shit and you're still stuck or your progress is just very slow what makes you think anything else is going to fucking change it's not if you were smart enough you would have figured it out by now so realize how ignorant stupid whatever you want to say you are and instead of feeling sorry for yourself or beating yourself up this is actually great I realize that early on I'm like I can't figure this out on my own and what did it allow me to do look for help receive help be open to receiving help and I mean it's crazy like be open to receiving help but here's a test you can do I'm sure you've tried introducing this knowledge to some of your friends are they open to receive it that was a great experience really check this out you might help fuck no now the question is what is your version of that where are you closed off just like your friends to that next level that next step you know sometimes you'll hear advice and it just challenges everything you know or everything about you it challenges your ego and we immediately reject it one thing you want to make sure you're doing is always staying open always be open to receiving advice and trying out things that challenge you and be willing to go through phases where you lose your bearings you temporarily used lose your bearings you know you're here you have your assumptions something comes and you test it you're like fuck this is actually right it means all these other things were wrong and you're kind of left a little uncertain but eventually you'll regroup and be willing to continuously do that so fuck your ego look for help don't think you know I'm just gonna be stubborn to do it on my own and be willing to challenge yourself and challenge your beliefs yeah the thing is ego is a tenacious motherfucker too no matter how much you're like you think that you're open to it you're always gonna have those knee-jerk reactions but it's important like ya have the knee-jerk reaction that no you know this is challenging my ego but then also have the wherewithal and the self-reflection to afterwards be like you know what after that knee-jerk reaction I can accept that I need that help and be open to it right now it's the wall I think to be honest I think it's like right to your bar right at my chest it feels like I'm thinking so much that I can't say anything the second game killer is surrounding yourself with the wrong people now you've probably heard that old aphorism you are the average of the five people that you hang out with most and for me at least back in the day that was kind of terrifying because my peer group consisted of like imbeciles and sex addicts and you know to an extent you could make that argument today but but basically you've got to cut out any negative and negative influences in your life and seek out influences that are gonna cause you to step up and they're gonna cause you to they're gonna raise the bar so to speak and cause you to step up right there's an old saying also a rising tide lifts all boats so rather than be I guess intimidated by being around people who are perhaps better than you at this skill set whatever skill set you're interested in you've got to take it as a challenge right to not be the punk of the group right and and more than I get moreover look to these people to help you so again you want to elaborate on that event yeah I mean I want to touch on the the side of it no one really talks about where you know I'm sure you've heard this like you're the average of the five people you spend most time with be aware of your influences but the catch is this say you're at the bottom and you realize this you're like you're right let's start myself with really cool people the catch is they also know this that you know you're the average of the five people you spend the most time with and they don't necessarily want someone who's below them to be part of their group because guess what now that's going to bring them down - so that's the catch so the challenge is how can i quote-unquote infiltrate these groups of people I want to model people I want to you know come like and it usually entails some kind of value proposition you're gonna have to bring something to the table so you can be smart there ask yourself hmm what don't they have that I have or that I can break whatever that is okay in any kind of field for example around us a big one in the very beginning when we were looking for say assistance to help film videos before we hired official teams was you know do you have any skills filming and if they did that was a good value proposition to get one foot in the door okay another one and people don't like in I mention this is paying for it real pay to be around those people pay to get one foot in the door if I know you have no money find a way to cultivate just a general value to bring to the table and you can work your way up to find a group right now that's a little bit above you and once you become the average of those people and you gather more value find a group that's above that and above that and start climbing up the groups yeah do it incrementally you know me and another big thing was this idea like back in the day when I was looking for wingmen oftentimes I didn't necessarily even care if the guy had like super good game all I cared about he was positive and he took action right because you know as we all know as you alluded to earlier a lot of guys when you mentioned this stuff they get very defensive like I could pick up this stuff is ridiculous tada so it was hard to find wings especially in the nascent era of the the pickup community so if I could just find some guys who wanted to go out and who were willing to go out and who wouldn't talk bad about the venue who wouldn't talk bad about the approaches and who wouldn't just stand there chod crystalling talking about game who were actually taking action that in and of itself was enough for me to be like okay this guy might have like the dopest game ever but I like him I like him as a person I like the energy he brings to the table and he's just kind of he's bringing the whole group up right so that's one way to get in ready ah scream louder  so number one is kill your ego number two is surround yourself with the best people you can to raise the tide and the third is set up systems of accountability now that sounds like kind of abstract kind of vague but do you want to again elaborate a little bit on that yeah I mean every person has a limited amount of say discipline or willpower every single day and so much of it is just spent on these tasks where you could just set up a system of accountability and not have to worry about it at all so let's just take for example an approach you know say you're scared shitless of talking to a girl you might walk around for hours and hours and hours on end and not being able to do it and that funny enough was me when I first started 2 3 months walking around doing nothing until or you could ask directions for the old lady yeah and to be fair I don't know if I'd even have figured out on my own like it was 3 months until I set up my first system of accountability which was finding a local group of guys you know like a layer back then it was three guys in Switzerland they were all super weird but they took action and being around that and funny enough it caught me a little bit they put more pressure for me to do it because I saw everyone doing it I'm like oh shit now if I don't do it it's not just me who knows they all know and that's put me in that situation where I didn't have a choice and that's we want to set up systems where you don't have a choice whether it's going out with wings whether it's some kind of financial incentive one thing I say - it's like whatever it is you're procrastinating on now the easiest way to beat it is just give 500 bucks a thousand bucks 10,000 whatever is a significant amount for you to a friend and tell your friend hey if I don't do this by then you keep the money now you're gonna fucking do it you're in that situation where you don't have a choice you don't have to worry about willpower you're gonna do it yeah and just hope that the friend doesn't just like disappear in your life I know right it's like some strange you give it to like a stranger on the street hey man can you hold this $10,000 police to do that like there's that whole like even like give 20 bucks to your friend be like I don't do 10 approaches tonight like it's a very micro level we're like a hundred it's like you get ten back per open now you just take care of all that unnecessary oh my god am I gonna do this my dues you just don't have a choice the only moment of uncomfort you have to go through is handing the cash and now you set up that system and you don't have choice yeah I believe you know that's called burning the boats or as the author Robert Greene we call it in his book master he said operating from a death ground so in fact if you're familiar with the history of RSD that's off that's kind of how we started you know we set up a variety of programs in far-flung locales all over the globe and we would arrive at these places sleeping on someone's floor who would like agree to let us sleep in their house and oftentimes we didn't even know if we were gonna get enough signups to make the airfare to the next city so again it was like we were burning the boats so if we didn't succeed if we didn't get signups then we were screwed you got to get to a point where the potential pain of making the change is now has been outweighed by the very real and immediate visceral pain of not making the change of the consequences that will happen if you do not make the change right yeah it's funny too like we were talking about like kill your ego but this is one spot where your ego can actually help because if you involve other people and that's the key involve other people so many guys they just do this alone and if it's just you say sitting at home right now and you're like I'm gonna take action today and you don't it's only you who knows it's like no one else knows whether I did it or not but if you involve other people suddenly your egos like you don't want to look like a fucking idiot in front of them step it up it's not this effort to get somewhere it's fuck this ego because that's we're doing we're hanging on to the front we're like maybe if I just just let go the fun and you think you'll fall it's so scary because you've been hanging on that front your entire life let go instead of falling you realize you're there so just to recap here the three things that you want to do if you want to live a life of abundance rock star sex life success like a Roman orgy from the times of Caligula versus living a life of shame misery circling the drain of despair like an involuntary celibate you got to do these three things number one kill the ego number two surround yourself with the right people and number three set up systems of accountability and I think that that's probably in large part why you actually created the transformation mastery Academy right I mean then it really embodies all three of those things if you think about it I mean I don't really know much about it you know as it's coming out it's new so you want to kind of speak to that a little bit yeah I wanted to basically or create a program that embodied all of this like this is so fucking key and I wanted a program that didn't just sit on your virtual shelf like on your desktop gathering you know dust I know yeah fuck the shelf help we just get a program you're like I'm gonna do it now and you get it you watch a bit and life happens and so often people like write that check they're like well I bought it so one day I could one day I could use it it's there if I when I you know for when this is done or went once I'm ready or anything like that and then it's there and watching this video electing Gus I'm sure you got some programs like that sitting on the shelf right now you know look at the dusty programs on the side of this video they're there so I wanted to create something that embodied this that was interactive and what I created is transformation mastery Academy where it's 12 months 12 interactive months where you're given content you're given assignments missions stuff to execute on including difference meditations to listen to stuff to go out in the real world stuff to ride outpost in a private Facebook group you're held accountable for it's by myself and my coaches a whole year yeah a whole year every month there's a book you have to read and then we all jump on a webinar discuss the book and just keep talking answering questions as well as a Q&A webinar where I answer all your questions of that month and the goal there is you can't be left behind you know it's one of those things where you don't have a choice yeah it's like you just don't have a choice you enroll in the 12 months I take you by the hand my team does - and you're stuck there is no escaping let's cover the neck and you will never escape so that's what the Academy is about it's about transforming at a deep level and really seen how these concepts that originally came from transformation mastery apply to all these different eras of life whether it's self sabotage inner happiness relationships breakups life crisis like all this shit that all of us go through you know you're gonna go through a life crisis are you prepared for it are you equipped for it you're gonna go through a fucking horrible breakup are you prepared for it you're gonna go through success barriers self-sabotage you probably know what you to do you're not doing it you need to be prepared for this and you need help you cannot do it on your own and it sounds so harsh to say but like we said here you can try and how's that gone you so far are you where you want to be where you just inching your way there and that's what it's for this is where people who are committed people who are really invested in this and that's why there's even that rope like that barrier of entry to just weed out the riffraff because the conversations I want in that Facebook group because I'm gonna be part of it too our high quality conversations with people who are going to take action who care not just the casuals yeah it's not just the YouTube comments just the comments below this video it's yeah it's not it's no dabblers so that's what the program is if you're someone who's committed if you're sick and tired of just dabbling around if you want someone to check up on you and you're part of this group this movement that's transformation that's your Academy so yeah so what should a we're stay going to I want to check it out little link below link below information mastery Academy calm go check it out there's amazing videos on there too free videos just watch those videos and getting the idea and resonate with it I'm honestly excited to see you inside the group become part of the TM fam and if not you'll get some sick-ass value yeah sounds pretty good man I mean I'm actually pretty except so to check it out myself so anyway there's been Jeffy and Julian and we'll see you next time we live in an uncertain world just turn on the news what do you see chaos terror suffering things are changing so fast that your head is spinning you know the feeling being pulled in different directions by your friends your family mainstream media not knowing what to do or who to believe did you ever stop and ask yourself how did your life get this way I felt so much shame when it come being me and now I don't feel that shame anymore I had no way of being able to deal with that pain and for the first time in my life I finally feel an inner stillness and peace in myself I didn't even know what was happening like my hands were shaking and it was just like me ping my authentic self most of us live lives of escapism anything to cope with this feeling beating us up inside distracting ourselves with dumb things on TV numbing ourselves with junk food alcohol cigarettes and drugs is this the way life was meant to be whereas there perhaps another way it's been the first time in over ten years since my dad died but I actually felt like I did before I decided to take a stance for good for love for authenticity and I created a movement of people dedicated to raising the vibe a movement dedicated to doing something about this and it's called transformation mastery a cabin that was amazing just being able to finally find that that root reason you want to thank each and every one of you under the bubble of my heart thank you guys now I'm not some fake guru promising new overnight results what I promise you here is a tribe of people to help support you and guide you along history in transformation mastery you'll no longer be alone you'll no longer feel lost you will be given the roadmap to true permanent personal transformation enough with this fake life of quiet desperation step into your truth and join the movement",BV5KBIo0b88
yo what up command-u from the Opera House in the center of Germany they see what I'm doing last night last time eunuch it's very exciting here ninjas walking around we're basically getting extremely drunk on large beers so that's going to be the topic of this little short Vblock I'm gonna get right now get me drunk now back in the day he's get extremely extremely drunk much every night I went out and it was pretty cool aside from the fact that I had 300 hangovers a year now look here's the deal getting drunk and it in and of itself isn't necessarily a bad thing I think that a couple beers can be helpful especially sometimes I get a student on boot camp and the dude is so stifled I'll actually insist he drink a couple of beers I know it's crazy but it can't be useful to actually like loosen the guy up now of course there's a threshold over which you pass and then you become sloppy no look my game as it were my verbal game as where it's pretty much it's kind of a it's interesting because there's two main elements of play it's like this vulgar idiot slash cartoon him saying retarded like garetty's but this is however juxtaposed with just remember her bein articulate conversationalist which kind of balances out the idiocy so the problem is once I get voted well her bein articulate conversationalist goes to the wayside which and we just are left with voter fluoride which isn't necessarily the best thing now again don't get me wrong I've done some of my best work like an absolutely shit-faced however the bottom line is this is just not consistent I mean look about consistency I think that one thing that's important and is this Gabe as it were again is not the everyone's looking for like the one thing that's going to increase their game by like 100 percent but in reality what game is it's an aggregate of a bunch of little things that are getting loose again by like 1% 1% 1% 1% you know it's crossing the t's dotting the eyes or crossing the eyes and timing the t's if you're drunk so  what is this some sort of pretzels or something like where does it say sit man anyway way back to the main point  we all love it it's fantastic I mean footage like a lie there's a few pleasures in life greater than when that first you have that first drink and you feel the king of the alcohol like absorbing into your stomach lining you're like oh yeah here we go but of course again so much as a problem so over the years I mean look if you read my book you know that nearly an economy cold turkey and that was necessary because you know I was pretty bad I didn't get in shave it was it was it had a control of my life that it really shouldn't have had but so I went cold turkey for a while but now absolutely I think that you know the pendulum because it was so extreme the pendulum had swung back to the other direction where mighty taller now all right of course and the inky extreme is necessarily held but who was it Aristotle and said that everything in moderation or something the golden mean what not so look these days I have an ambivalent controlled relationship with it I might kick start the night with two and then from there on out one per hour alternate them is drink with water and this what enables you like get into that nice so for your loose like a goose you know but you're not like you're not going big like t-rex where you're like fighting people set off okay that made no sense at all but it's probably the Stein so all right so again one per hour is allows you with your body to metabolize it you're drinking water in between and so it's cool you're in the bar nice to have a drink in your hand you know it's fun and social but you're not getting slop so take it from Jeff beer is good by the way beer also just you know beer is not food and I learned that the hard way at one time years ago I was taking some medication it's a take with food and I was like well beers food right mr. keys no it is not food oh thank you Cheers a woman she looks very stout very very stout I bet she is a pirate in another life  I'd love to see how much she can get lose she came out her earlier carrying like seven seven Stein's at once anyway I'm gonna get into some of this like traditional German fare here and so again Jeffy signing off from Munich heading to Sweden tomorrow morning and just have another V blog once I'm there and talk to you guys soon  Oh  pinpin kind of give and take,Bn6Fu9RaoyU

"[Music] streetwear mother still sleeping ha yo sup guys this is Jeff coming at you today from the Hamptons where the mansions are more than a million riches a billion and nobody's saving the children today we're going to be taking a question from RC nation and the question is this how do you deal with having so much attention on you because I've developed myself it seems that people watch me more and will be influenced by my mood good or bad one of the groups like people are waiting for me to talk or to do something what are some things you can do to ease social tension to make people feel more comfortable I think the most important thing to consider when you're looking at a question like this that this particular question is is how comfortable are you yourself with having that attention on you because you know it goes back to the whole principle whatever you feel they feel you know the law of state transfer so if you if you roll up and all eyes are on you and you're clearly not dealing without that social pressure well you feel uncomfortable hence through the whole mirror neurons process they end up feeling uncomfortable as well then you and you get you know less than ideal outcome so taking it further I guess um you know how were we how can we go about developing that ability to be more comfortable being the center of attention well you know look I've said it before I'll say it again identity is a very fluid concept okay of course for a lot of people too it's a pretty slow moving fluid but nonetheless you know it will you can't shift slowly over time so you just got to take your time with I mean shit again I've been doing this for ten years and you know it took me that long to actually become a few maybe 10 years ago a completely different person oh very introverted the kind of person where um you know my friends are talking in the group and you know the other guys would like the latter dudes were just like talk over me is very hard for me to get in like a conversation you know get my threads in it slipped in edgewise but how did I how did I go about shifting that well of course number one is gonna be going out if you don't approaching but anything that that is gonna get you comfortable being the center of attention okay anything is going to make you for be force to become a center of texture whether it's like a public speaking type thing you know maybe Toastmasters or something in that nature maybe you know karaoke was huge for me going up and like making a fool myself singing fucking Steve Perry songs and like Peter Cetera okay in a very impassioned manner well you know many drunk strangers watch and Jer you know that'll get you comfortable be the center of attention real quick you know taking an improv class being up on stage we enforce the thing on your feet you know familiarizes the miller eyes yourself with with those kind of situations so the end of the day when you do approach you are actually you know comfortable with that you know that attention you put on you and hence you know they they're gonna feel comfortable around you so so again treat the root cause not the symptoms right like how can i mitigate when they feel uncomfortable when i go in and it's obvious that i'm uncomfortable having a discerner of a tetrapod on me well you don't be uncomfortable having a center of attention put on you long story short so yeah but having said that um you know let's say you do go in and regardless of your best you know best intentions in your best interest of like uncomfortable cuz I'm just other people are just awkward as well right so that situation I'm some practical tips for kind of like mellowing things out I mean you know again just use for it for a point of like 100 percent expression like look inside feel inside your body where my words coming from are they coming from a place of you know I hope these people like stay and keep talking to me or they come from to a place of self amusement right am I just fucking around interjecting like things that I feel or you know come to root with my own humor like the way you'd be around your closest friends again the you never run like you never run out of things to say around your friends right you're not like oh I really note of things to say why because you don't give a fuck you know they've already accepted you it's like that's your fam right and they've I have hardly accept you warts and all so you can say whatever stupid shit in reality what ends up happening is you know you're totally on stifled so you're just you just able to crack jokes on the fly freely and of course again the more you go out and practice these kind of skills the better it's going to get but you know 10,000 hours to mastery for those of you haven't read that book by George Leonard mastery time-honored classic here in these parts so you don't definitely recommend you check that out so you know it's pretty much it um stride go pack my stuff and get on the road back to SF and I'll see you guys next time namaste motherfuckers I'm gonna hand this for the Mancha's is making a million be amazed a million nobody's saving the children when I'm from being broken  [Music]",Cxt9kVgpHcg
whatup proverbial boy here and today I want to talk to you about how to stay engaged after you've achieved success so when you're first starting out learning a skill or your first like just starting out your career path there's literally nowhere to go but up and oftentimes it's that lack of results that hunger that provides the fuel for you to keep going on and know there's an old saying it's easy to be hungry when you ain't got shit to lose so when I was younger I was essentially like a walking dead man with literally nothing to lose I was dangerous I was shameless and I was totally out of fucking control but now here I am at age 42 and at this point I've been all over the world coaching guys on how to meet women having I'm successful within and I've had massive adventures in that area myself in fact some of the things that I've seen and done would just boggle the average guy's mind and like you know an orgy out of a rock star's life that kind of shit but again bear in mind when you're watching this channel this is all based on real-world experience okay which by the way if that's something that interests you in real world advice based on real-world experience well please take a moment to like and subscribe right now because I'm coming with these videos at you every Tuesday now that it's actually happened now that I've made the myth so to speak now that I've achieved a level of success and I become financially comfortable as well well it's at that point that a different angle starts to sort of creep in from the edges and what I'm talking about here is that creeping desire to just kind of pack it in to relax and enjoy the fruits of all my labor and beyond that since I've kind of seen it all if you will there's another even more pernicious feeling that creeps in as well and that is the belief that the desire to go out the desire to get laid it's kind of like juvenile even like oh you know I've done all this stuff that's just fucking juvenile maybe I should just give up this pick up nonsense just rest on my laurels and coast along on my pickup pension yes because we've called it on these videos now for those of you don't know what I'm talking about pick a pension it's basically the idea that after you've slept with hundreds of women well it's not like those people just like magically evaporate into the fucking ether or afterwards right they're still kicking around somewhere on this planet I mean yes statistically I'm pretty sure that at least one of those girls is dead right now right it would stand to reason at least one of them is somehow I met some sort of inauspicious end but the vast vast majority of them are still out there so once in a while right they'll just kind of come out of the woodwork and be like oh hey are you still an SF I'm in town let's hang out and you know one thing leads to another so theoretically you could continue to get laid for the rest of your life just off of this right yeah you know just like a pension you know and like a real pension it probably actually sucks and it's not like you wouldn't actually want to live on it but it is out there but look that's beside the point but here's the actual main point and this is something that old buddy Gary Vaynerchuk talks about quite a lot and it's the idea that entitlement is fuckin cancer right this idea that you somehow deserve continued success because you've had success in the past this shit needs to be absolutely eradicated from your life so it may be sobering but it's true you're only as good as your last performance and the thing is that's fuckin life and if you reach the point where you're jaded about that aspect of existence then yet you know what you might as well pack it in it's like the same kind of belief systems like ye you're just gonna get hungry again why fuck you're just gonna get horny again what hell why breathe for that matter you're just gonna need to take another gulp of oxygen soon enough so again you need to find joy in the process you need to find joy in that engagement with life engagement with the world and you know what worked yesterday won't necessarily work tomorrow necessarily for example Instagram game popped up and all my little buddies were telling me you got to get on this Instagram it's like the wave of the future it's eventually gonna even replace YouTube etc etc and I was like honestly in terms of like the rsd guys I was probably like one of the last adopters in terms of the rst instructors to actually get on instagram and now I'm on it I'm like oh yeah this is actually really cool it's like it's it's I'm seeing results from and that's like getting the topic of a whole nother video but the idea is this chain is inevitable now I had an interesting conversation the other night with a group of elders outside of the karaoke bar was at the mint lounge here in San Francisco and I was outside and there was like these guys I thought they were my age and someone was inside singing the Cyndi Lauper song girls just want to have fun and I was telling these dudes just struck up a conversation was like you guys know that the original version of the song it was written by a man from the perspective of like a young guy who's like fucking all these girls and his parents are giving him shit about it like hey boy you need to like stop fucking around and going out and coming in late at night he's like mom dad girls just want to have fun right so I'm like yeah you know a lot of these youngsters won't understand this but you know when you're when you get to be our age you know some things and they're like our age we're like how old are you I'm like I'm 42 and these guys that turned out they were like in their 50s and they were just very well-preserved gay gentlemen so I asked these guys I'm like okay dude what's the secret like what is the secret to staying engaged what's the secret to having a good life when you get older and one of these guys he turned to me and he said literally just like he said you already know what to do you already know what to do in other words there is no secret by this point you already fucking know dude it reminded me of a quote from the Norwegian author Carl of canals guard who wrote to turn 40 is to realize that one's limitations will last ones whole life through but also to know that all the time whether one likes it or not and whether one is aware of it or not new layers are being added to one's character okay a type of knowledge and insight that is not directed towards the future towards what will come to pass or one day be accomplished but towards the here and now in the things that you do every day and what you think about them and what you understand of them so mouthguard he here frames ageing as a kind of descent into Buddhism like the mindful enlightenment of being in the now now at 42 I understand that it's not about changing okay it's about trusting who you are trusting how you got here and learning how to access that fucking zone to shut out all the noise to shut out all the lies to shut out all the negativity and distractions and it's really also about finding something to continue striving for us how to motivate yourself that's really what it's about so the question is like what motivates our Coby what motivates our LeBron James to go for multiple rings after he's achieved the success and look you don't have to love the hard work right I mean who does but you do have to crave the unending and this is a big one as well I think and it's this if you start to think like an old person that's when you become an old person the big component of staying engaged once you've achieved success it's mental right like I said you know what to do you just have to like basically get in get yourself into gear and take action and that's a big thing that Owens always talked about he's like Jeff like when I see you like getting into that zone nobody produces on the team better than you but for you it's very difficult to make that state change to go from a place of where you're not like taking a lot of action to actually like shift out of that homeostasis and get into that mode and it reminds me of like back when I first did the hot seat number the Jeffie hot seat number two it was summer of 2015 I hadn't been out filming in quite some time and Owens like look man I want you to actually do a new hot seat and here I was I was 40 at the time and literally my thoughts were do I still have it in you know can I do this shit the youngsters are putting out all this crazy content you can't I even do this at age 40 right so I went out and I started filming yeah it took me a couple weeks to shake the rust off but the next thing you know I'm pimping hard like pulling threesomes like left and right every other night and I literally believe that I'm Jesus okay and I remember I showed some of this footage at the the Vegas summit that year and people were like holy shit like I didn't know Jeff had it fuckin in them you know what I mean so so again it's finding the ability to shift into that gear right and now another thing to be wary of is not coasting on talent having said that and this is something that I struggled with back in high school for that matter you know I was very I was always like really I just kind of coasted through academically in all pretty much all of high school and then was like when I got to college university I was so used to like not having to put in any effort that actually like I struggled you know and that was also mentally fucked up in a lot of ways I ended up dropping out in under two years but that's beside the point right so it just dole coast on success another different example I could give of that is if you're into there like MMA if you're into the UFC and stuff like that is the fighter the story of the fighter BJ Penn this guy is from Hawaii he was known as the prodigy this dude so gonna jujitsu he can fucking use like all every one of his lit like limbs as an additional hand basically you know doing all these crazy omoplata sand stuffing so basically he grew up in Hawaii he was a natural his nickname was the prodigy cuz he would just kick everyone's fucking ass and when he got into the professional level he kicked everyone's ass there too and telling he Mets who George st. Pierre now George st. Pierre's background was like almost the polar opposite this guy was from Montreal Quebec he was a garbage man so he would have to wake up at like 4:00 a.m. to go to his garbage man job in the snow and then find time to train in between there so when he got to an elite level he met up with BJ Penn and he actually ended up handing Biggio Penn's asked to him twice right because be defense condition he was not up to speed he was too used to kid coasting along on that national talent so when he got to that elite level he actually end up getting his ass handed to him and you know I say this with love BJ Penn is actually one of my favorite fighters ever but still it was like an instructive lesson for me so look if you've achieved a certain level of success that's great you know you're obviously good but now it's about finding the nuances about finding the holes in your game and working on those and this is something I seen with advance guys that come on to boot camp you know a lot of guys would say why would an advanced guy come onto boot camp I had a student last month this Australian dude he'd said he told me it's up with over 200 girls and I believed him you know just like a good-looking guy very in shape Australian accent I mean come on give me a fucking break and then seeing his game he was actually quite hip in Paree is pimper he was paying off right so people ask me why would this guy come on boot camp well over the course of those three days we were able to shave off rough edges of things that like most guys wouldn't even notice of like how to find logistical you know how to thread the logistical needle better and stuff like that the point is you've got to find a way to motivate yourself and one thing that really helped me in the early days was anger you know when I was young I was like seething with rage and hatred all the time and I find that very motivating in a way right now today I'm much much calmer now you know less less rage attacks but that little seed is still there right I mean come on frankly if you take a look I'll look around at the world today and you really don't feel a strong urge to smash plate-glass windows well you're probably too stupid to be saved anyway okay so haha you know I always see myself in the rst Avengers team I would be the Hulk that's the secret I'm always angry and I still use that Tyler it used that in the past too you know Tyler he's always used you know as telling me like one of them his main motivations is to become successful to show up the haters right show up the guys who talked shit or put them on blast and some best-selling book or whatever he's like you know what I'd sort of show these guys they made the wrong decision of my life style is awesome and we're kicking ass with our esteem right you know I feel the same way when you're looking at like it's like comments on YouTube like idiots are like pick up this fake right so a lot of that I've used that as a source of motivation in the past as well but ultimately this is so fucking important because why if you do not remain engaged you will die it sounds hyperbolic right but I mean look at the case of my father my father retired and you know for a variety of reasons essentially this guy he felt that there was nothing left for him to live for and sure enough he was dead with it under two years at age 67 and you know yes maybe that's a bit anecdotal but it's like take it for what it is I mean the consensus that I got from talking to people that were around him at the time was that he had just sort of given up on life you know Bill Gates the the great billionaire philanthropist he actually said that there's many domains to be successful in right that's another thing to bear in mind so it's like when he was in school he was successful like getting good grades and test scores right and beyond that then he became successful at writing code and you know by the early 2000s his dream of having you know PC in every household that was actually starting to come true as well and now he's working on you know eradicating polio eradicating malaria and Bill Gates you know I read up you know here's an amazing blog by the way which is pretty insightful and he was talking about this and he emphasized that it's always good to have goals where your success is in doubt right like find new goals where your success is in doubt and do that in many areas and he and he feels that personally in areas that work he's doing it right now like where his work with climate change for example like he feels that he might not be successful in that by anyone's standards this guy's you know slaying some dragons right but he is still finding new avenues to challenge himself in to engage so to recap number one entitlement is fucking cancer complacency must be fought at all costs trust who you are trust how you got to where you are and remember how to access that zone remember what it takes to get you in that zone while continuing to shave the off the rough edges so to speak and keep those bigger demons at bay okay keep a young mindset find motivation through whatever means necessary and remain engaged by continually continually exploring new disciplines anyway this is Jeff e and I'll see you next time we created the hot seat because we didn't want to do just seminar about these concepts they wanted to show you

hey hey hey is Jessie here and today I want to talk about what to do when girls ignore you so we've all seen it you approach girl and she gives you this highly skeptical condescending facial expression okay almost as though she is absolutely disgusted that such a filthy commoner would have the temerity to dare approach her every word you say is just further confirming her initial assessment than you are this sickening worm beneath her in every imaginable way so what do you do to turn it around so before we get into this I'd like to remind you to LIKE and subscribe to this channel if you like real talk from the trenches every single week that's what I'm bring it to you so back to the topic at hand when a very attractive girl won't open up to me on the approach I tend to do the same kind of thing now when we're talking about the open what does that actually mean opening means you get past the social hook point social hook point means that point that you pass when she goes from thinking who the hell is this guy and why is he speaking to me - okay this person's cool let's continue to interact with them and that can happen instantaneously or it can take up to a couple of minutes but until you get to that point it is not open quote unquote so when you get this sceptical response from the girl like a lot of times you'll go up to the girl and you'll speak to her and she'll give you this skeptical look right this sort of like oh great like phenomenal great the next idiot of the night what it's at first it's very important to understand that this is an autopilot response on her part that has been developed over years and years of being approached by cretins okay so it's not something that you want to take on board or take it personally or even worse allow it to like curdle into these like misogynist beliefs this does not serve you this is not helping you in any way and furthermore it's important to understand what the parameters are and work within them a lot of guys oh well it's unfair that this is how the game is what have you irrelevant doesn't matter you know what the parameters are work within them and just be happy that you know what they are because most people don't so when I say more open what I'm talking about in the context of this particular video is I mean when she's trying to put on a front like she doesn't think you're cool or that she thinks like the conversation isn't cool enough for her she's not simply skeptical because again that's par for the course but in this case what we're talking about is what to do when she is almost hostile towards you off the open in a sort of like too cool for school sort of way so if she does that and I continue on the throat I'm saying to her I'm losing value because if I'm willing to talk to someone who's fronting on me like that that naturally makes me a bit of a tool so generally what I'll do in these situations is I'll continue on is if I don't realize she's even fronting on me because that would sub communicate something to the effect that I never have people not respond to me well and that it simply does not even occur to me that you would be doing that because it's not something that's even in my reality now there's an important distinction to note here oftentimes you'll see newer guys you see this guy who goes up he approaches and he doesn't realize that he's getting tooled on but not because he just can't fathom that that would happen to him but because he's oblivious right in the case we're talking about here I understand that it's happening and so I'm reacting in a certain way because I understand oftentimes you'll see guys go up and the girl you know begins to tool him in this way and he's just completely oblivious and just plows ahead blithely that's bad why is that bad because it suggests that he has a poor ability to read social cues and or possibly low empathy like again he's just blithely carrying on thinking he's doing awesome with zero regard for the girls subjective emotional experience so the distinction here is that my attitude it's more like well she's fronting me but it's obviously some kind of joke because nobody would actually do that right like I see it but I can't take it seriously so it's sort of like the hand of God if you know what that is that's an opener that we sometimes advocate or or have guys do where you simply go up make eye contact with the girl get and then you deploy your hand for her to shake it and then when she does shake it you you gently pull her in and say who are you and and begin from there now many guys love this opener it's their favorite opener because it's so concise it says all the right things all the right sub communications and they just love it other guys can never make it work and the reason the difference between those two guys is the guy who can make it work he's not permission seeking like the guy for who it can never work for is the guy who's like do you wanna take it right versus the guy who it tends to work for this guy who goes up expect it like of course you're gonna take it because everyone else does so the key here on this is no emotional fluctuation aside from possibly mild amusement and beyond that I'm also just projecting my voice in a way that's steady enough that there is no choice for them but to acknowledge me so from there I might say something like you're from the East Coast aren't you you've got that kind of no-nonsense no BS vibe about you and then I'll turn to my wing and I'll start laughing and maybe I'll say some of the effect of damn this is too hardcore man I can't even handle her or something like even to her damn you're like the mean cool kids used to make fun of me in high school in addition to this I'm often inclined to just look at her like she's a complete imbecile for reacting like that I'm not saying that but just kind of that's my facial expression and then turning to my friend and just keep talking to my friend right and I'll specifically do this when she's giving me like some grief or something like that now now take note here because the difference between this working and not working is whether or not you're creating a tension a tension loop if you will where she's wanting to show you how cool she is by blowing you off right so it like if the girl was about to take pleasure and blowing you off and then you blow her off before she can do it to you well there's that tension there that she wanted to interact with you it's like yeah it's possible that her desire to interact with you was to tell you but remember that it was still a desire to interact with you regardless so that unresolved tension can still manifest in a positive direction simply by patent by virtue of the fact that she's reacting to you that puts her in your frame okay so from there and then without hesitation I'll immediately turn away from her to face my buddy and I'll start interacting with him and it's having the most like witty phenomenal phenomenally hysterical conversation that I can imagine right genuinely enjoying it mind you like we're laughing we're having this great time and all of a sudden were like the warm side of the pool the coolest guys in the room and now she's the one that's wanting in on our conversation and by the way I want to really emphasize here that done correctly it never looks like I'm trying too hard to see him this way right it looks completely legit like I'm just having a conversation with my buddy like I'm not one of those guys that's talking a little too loud trying to make the girl hear that I'm blowing her off and you'll see this out in the club from the newbie pickup guys a lot of the time who have kind of poured in her game low self confidence and so they'll turn to the wing and it's fully transparent that it's directed towards the girl right so I'm not like directing it towards her I'm legit talking to my wing this furthermore will make her actually kind of have to partially strain to hear it even which makes it even more legitimate most often it looks so legitimate that my buddy is convinced that I'm really blowing the girl off right like even after I've done this countless times my buddy he'll be convinced that this time it's for real and that's my friend let alone the girl okay so this element is so so important in order for this to work so if all goes well the girl will typically say something like me so what were you asking about eh what were you asking about right I'll look over for a second and then I'll keep talking with my wing okay so this resembles what the girl will actually look like when a guy who lacks value tries to talk to her so if again if it's done correctly many many times she'll start grabbing my arm and then flirting with me and then four marriages proceed as normal so done properly I found that this conveys phenomenal amounts of value and thus really smarts attraction and strangely you know oddly enough this thing is this kind of thing has been the start of several relationships with some really cool and attractive girls over the years and I suppose it goes to show that you know this is just how important it can be at times to be able to plow through that socially conditioned skepticism to your approach so this is very very subtle even counterintuitive stuff that a lot of people most people in fact just don't understand about social interaction and there's two sides to that charisma coin the first is knowing things about social interaction in able you to maneuver smoothly and the second is dialing your inner belief systems and getting right with yourself internally so those tactics if you will are coming from a place of authenticity which is absolutely essential for success and this is what I'm going to be teaching in depth and my upcoming charisma mastery workshop which is going to be a broad spectrum program to systematically develop that quality of charisma with the absolute best exercises the best teaching strategies to have profound and lasting effect so if you want to be kept in the loop you get on that early VIP list right now by heading over to charisma mastery calm anyway this has been Jeffie and I'll see you next time now hand of God the reason we named it hand of God you know why because God always wins because they're not doing with enough conviction the feeling they're giving off it's it's permission seeking so you want to have it more than expectant vibe like you're expecting like of course you're gonna take it because everyone else does you're almost like confused and shocked when they don't but you really want to like get that in your head like when I step like excuse me excuse me excuse me excuse me  who are you who are you who are you who are your mascara is here mysterious Bolivia Colombia Colombia your voice turnout is gonna be very very powerful and that is what is going to enable you to open a very consistent of system system system system  [Music],DfhPBpX5X4I

"yo yo yo what up boy Jeffy I'm here today in Austin Texas at the flagship Whole Foods location and today what I want to talk to you about is the concept of motivation so it would cold approach pick up and when I say that I mean the ability to approach a track and engage in sexual intercourse with strangers in a relatively short period of time well this is something that requires skill okay that kind of goes without saying but it is a skill and like any other skill if you want to become exceptional at it long and difficult hours of practice are necessary so recently I read a popular book by Daniel Coyle entitled the talent code which attempts to debunk the so-called myth of talent and really get to the bottom of what causes people to develop skills quickly and the basic premise of the book is this performing a skill uses circuits of neurons in your brain and a fatty coating of something called myelin builds up around our nerves axons which are the long sort of wires that connect them to other neurons now for a long time researchers ignored myelin or so-called white matter as as this kind of useless inside an insulator that it was just an insulator but more recently they've come to understand that it actually strengthens and speeds up nerve signals and today it's viewed as the neurological basis of acquired skills so repeated firings of a neuron such as might happen in practice they actually use a more myelin growth so more myelin means more skill so coil stresses that talent is actually the result of many many hours of hard practice which trigger repeated and urgent neuron firings and he also cites the popular idea that it takes about 10,000 hours of practice or about a decade to achieve mastery so okay having said all that you got understand over the past ten years that I've been doing this this job I've worked with literally thousands of students in our infield boot camps and I followed the subsequent development of many of these guys and you got understand you know boot camp first off it's on a magical pill but rather an orientation and a massive push of momentum it sets you on the right path it reveals both your strengths and your sticking points it also gives you a little boost okay and I always tell guys that you know by the end of the weekend they're going to be about a level or two above where they were when they walked in the door on the first night but at the end of the day there's no getting around the fact that if you want to truly achieve your full potential and internalize this skill set to the level of that unconscious competence then you're going to have to put in the work after the program so what is the difference between the guys who are able to persevere through that initial pain period where they don't see results and the guys who much like the new year's resolution shows at the gym simply dip their feet in for a while become frustrated and give up well ultimately that distinction is going to be motivation and without motivation those hours of practice that are going to be required to achieve mastery are simply going to be excruciating okay so having said all of that what is motivation and how can we get it well I was reading an article about this very subject in Scientific American recently I subscribed to Scientific American and I read it on the toilet and anyway in this article psychologists identified three basic elements that support motivation so the good news is that all three of these variables can be consciously tweaked to your benefit so the first of these is autonomy simply put you gain motivation when you feel as though you are in charge so back in 2006 psychologists at the University of Rochester conducted experiments wherein subjects were given a choice to select a course of action based on their own opinions for example giving a speech for or against a given topic and these people persisted longer in a subsequent puzzle-solving activity than participants who were pressured to select one side over another so the conclusion here is fairly obvious you know acting under duress is taxing whereas doing what you want is energizing and this is why on bootcamp I'll employ things such as the 30-second game you know as opposed to just shoving guys into set so rather than you know point out specific girls and instruct them to approach I'll simply begin counting them down for 30 you know 30 29 28 27 and they have until 0 to actually do an approach so if we get to 0 and they haven't done an approach they get a little bone they get a little rabbit punch to the arm now when I play this game with my crew at home we will actually do like a full force punch to the gut but with the client you know we don't want to get this we don't wanna get sued so but at the bottom line you know I love this approach for several reasons first off I like how it reduces your criteria for success from go up and be awesome - don't get punched but furthermore I really like how it puts the student in the driver's seat all right so it's not just me telling him what to do putting him in this beta role where he's following orders instead he is the master of his own destinies free to choose whatever girl he wants and I've noticed that with this approach the students tend to get far better results than the old point and shove technique from back in the day the students they just tend to stay in the interactions longer they tend to get better results when they themselves choose which girls so this is a real-world example that basically bears out the findings of these researchers and again the finding of the research were that the perception of autonomy predicts the energy with which individuals pursue a goal so the second variable that affects motivation is going to be value and when you assign value to an activity this boosts your sense of autonomy and in turn your level of motivation so several studies have found a positive correlation between students valuing a subject in school and their willingness to look into a question independently it was at the the University of Virginia the psychologist Christopher Holloman he described a study in which one group of students wrote about the importance of science in their lives and the other group of students simply summarized what they'd learned in science class and those students who reflected on the importance of science they actually dramatically improved their grades and reported a greater interest than students in the summary writing group so the good thing here is that value can be modified and so this is why it's important to take the time to reflect and ask yourself you know why am I doing this what am i alternately attempting to accomplish here and and why so with regards to pickup you gotta ask yourself am I just like are you just going through the motions and it sort of rote perfunctory manner just because you think you should for some ill-defined reason or maybe so your friends will think you're cool or do you really want to cultivate an enjoyment of the process and improve social skills that that translates to a better life you know fulfilling romantic relationships and of course let's not forget the okay personally I got into this because I'm a horny dude and I love to bang and ultimately in my opinion this whole thing it cannot be about ego it has to be about sex so take time to think about this as reflecting on why pickup is meaningful to you can make you more invested in it so the final piece of the puzzle is competence and as you go out and practice game more and more you will gradually notice your skills improve and of course you know that's going to be provided that you're being intelligent about your growth which means actively seeking out and removing blind spots as opposed to just you know banging your head against the wall Todd had a video about this recently back in New Orleans well they filmed where he talked about our practice does not make perfect practice makes permanent so if yours going out and doing stupid over and over again you're not going to get better yours going to continue to stagnate and do the same thing however but if you are being actively if you're putting yourself on the cross you're actively being intelligent about your growth that's when you're going to see that the confidence come but you know as you see the skills grow you gain a sense of competence so studies demonstrate that a strong there is a strong correlation between a for example a person's sense of prowess and their desire to pursue sports in other words if you think that you're good at a specific game you're going to want to play it though right but an interesting thing is that it works both ways so right practice makes you more likely to consider yourself competent and a sense of competence strongly predicts that you'll actually get off your ass and go out and approach women numerous studies out of Stanford University University have shown that competence comes from recognizing the basis of accomplishment which of course brings us back to Daniel Coyle and the talent code if you attribute competence to some sort of innate talent and of course and pick up this might be say the classic you know good looks height money etc nonsense or even on a different level you know a guy thinking well you know this just isn't me I'm not outgoing enough I'm an introvert or you know I don't have a lot of sexual experience I'm not a really sexual person whatever the case may be you know it's just a guy saying it this isn't me if you attribute it to some innate thing that you have little to no control over as opposed to hard work well then you're going to be much more likely to give up when facing a novel challenge right because you assume that you're going to assume that it exceeds your ability now for the vast majority of students on bootcamp the weekends this incredible experience they learn a lot they leave both well-equipped and eager to tackle the game with their newfound skills when they return back home and you know after the program however from time to time I will get someone who struggles and ultimately finds the program unsatisfying and typically the root cause of this is that the guy simply doesn't believe that he will be able to do it after the program okay now on the other hand look at someone like Tyler what enables this guy to go out endlessly night after night for years on end what enables Owen to challenge himself constantly to improve his game and to consistently up the ante on every single product release that he's done for the past decade culminating most recently and of course in the hotseat 3 which people are saying blows everything he's shown earlier out of the water well the bottom line this guy he understands that hard work is the ultimate determinant of success not luck not innate talent and this is why you'll often see guys who study pick up surpass many so-called Naturals right the guy who has to work for it builds a connection between those efforts and his success while the natural takes it for granted and sort of ends up in float imposing a sort of glass ceiling on his ability and as soon as it gets beyond his comfort zone the news shuts down because he doesn't know what to do or how to even begin to tackle the challenge he has not made that connection between hard work and success and a classic example of this would be from the world of MMA with one of my favorite fighters BJ Penn and for those unfamiliar you're unfamiliar with this is a fighter out of Hawaii whose nickname is The Prodigy and this guy he has an incredible aptitude for fighting extremely tough quick agile amazing in States they are so flexible that it could basically use his legs as like an extra pair of arms ok I could be choking some dude out with his foot I think if it was like this but what's this someone handles the foot choking me out of my neck you know pulling off these crazy moves like omoplata Xand and all this stuff and so BJ Penn growing up in Hawaii he just went around in this like island paradise and whooped everybody's asked with complete ease right guys way bigger than them all comers right you name it so when he became a professional fighter well he basically breezed through the ranks you know totally dominating as a lightweight I needed going up weight classes you know welterweight middle mate middle middle weight even light heavyweight was singing Li in a little difficulty until finally he went up against this other guy George st. Pierre and this was a guy for whom nothing came easy all right he grew up in freezing Montreal and he was actually working as a garbage man you know waking up at the ass crack of dawn to go out in the snow and pearl garbage into a truck and then after that had several miles again through the snow to train at his gym for several hours each and every single day to get to that elite level well long story short georges de pierre won both their first and second matchups and it was in many ways sort of the beginning of the end for the prodigy and of course you know those of you who follow MMA probably know that the first was a split decision and the second match had a bit of a controversy involving like Vaseline and grease and all this but but still the takeaway lesson for me and again I'm saying this is someone who's a huge fan of BJ Penn is that when it came down to it BJ wasn't able or willing to put in the work that was required to face the novel challenge presented by Georges st. Pierre and your overarching narrative after the fights was that you know BJ didn't seem to take it seriously he showed up sort of out of shape with questionable cardio expecting that he could just rely on his talent okay and so there was a lot of criticism that he didn't dedicate himself fully to training and simply coasted by on his considerable natural ability while on the other hand you had George say Pierre with his like insane work ethic clawing and scratching for every interests he got so you have to make that connection between hard work and success experience breeds competence which in turn breeds confidence it's a self-perpetuating loop so the next time you find yourself struggling to put your damn shoes on and to drag your lazy ass out to the club ask yourself this what's missing it's likely that the answer lies in one of these three areas one feeling forced to finding the whole thing pointless or three doubting your capabilities addressing these sources of resistance can give you a second wind and strengthen your resolve and the best part is that it's totally within your control so this is jeppy here in Austin and as my young friend Julian would say until next time fugitive fusion and fission and photography check inflation inflation inflation and photography check inflation fission and fusion and fission",EVi_stWU8oU

yo yo what up it should proverbial bully Jeffy here once again our wonderful Wednesday afternoon preparing to go on a romantic date to a place called the old clam house no pun intended but before I you know beast off to the the old clam house I just wanted to crap out a quick video here and discuss something that I feel is disproportionately whined about in the community and that is the concept of white knights right a lot of times guys say well what do I do these white knights I'm not at the bar I'm gaming girls and white knights intervene and fuck up my set they fuck my game up how do I stop these white knights okay how do I stop these white knights and I'm here to tell you you don't need to stop the fucking white knights the white knights will stop themselves I guess a better way of putting it this you say instead of trying to actively stop the white knights you know what are some tricky lines I can use to discredit them when I come in how can I blow them off blow them out and get the girl you're coming up.this from the wrong mindset okay because the point is if your game is on point if your game is legit there's nothing a fucking so-called white knight can vehicle right there's very very little than a a white knight can do if the girl likes you if the girl likes you he's just gonna come and make a fool of himself so look I am a firm believer in the idea that everything bad that happens to you is on some level your own fault so no I mean again this isn't to say like people who are born into poverty and in Africa or in the you don't think at all this is put themselves up by their bootstraps I mean obviously you know outliers like that Bulai the the truth of the ultimate truth is that phrase but you know forever average everyday scenarios that you're gonna encounter you know what again on some level your choice is up to that point are what led to you being in that situation you know and again just to reiterate aside from you you know having a gun put to your fucking head in on the street can be mugged or something like that but that even then maybe you chose to be in the wrong part of town and oblivious to your surroundings who fucking knows so the point is this resist the urge to externalize failures to externalize issues right well you know I didn't get to grow because this fucking white knight came up right look internally and say maybe what can I have done differently that again this white knight would come up and none of this sure would have happened case in point other night I was out at where the hell were we were at place called Bergerac which is down in a lemon Street here in San Francisco and we're at someone's birthday party or something like that and I decided to just approach a set of girls at a table and I was dressed like a complete fucking asshole I'll probably I'll post of a pic of what I looked like but I was wearing these creeper ass glasses at the time and I stepped at these girls and I'm like hey ba bla bla bla you know just chatting him up and starting to work in my you know statements of Tim I flirtatious comments and so forth and then all of a sudden I come up behind me a guy that works there and he's you know checking in on the girls and he says to me in like a very kind of obnoxious aggressive kind of way hey man are you okay is everything okay basically looking to me like are you bothering these girls that was the subtext now again this ain't my first rodeo I've been out doing this stuff for 14 years and as such I knew that's what he was saying right so what'd I say did I fool this guy look yeah fucking COO make book out of here or anything like that I just again simply just very simply you responded to his question oh no I'm good thanks man thank you very much boom and it's like then he turns to the girls and he's like are you ladies all right here like again is this asshole that's dressed like a fucking ass clown slash Michael Jackson from the Thriller video slash quasi fight lunatic is this like obvious player bothering new ladies and they thought I was cool and so they're like no no we're good thanks and then as the guy leaves I'm like yeah I appreciate that the disestablishment takes care of its customers and ensures that they're not being harassed by fucking weirdos and the girl looks at me and she's like oh you caught that I'm like yes I caught that I'm not like some oblivious lunatic just standing here in my own little world anyway BAM and I just rolled it on so again I get the guy came in and I gotta respect it on a certain level you know this is his establishment he doesn't want like these pickup ass clowns bothering girls at the establishment and that's what a lot of these guys don't get the so-called white knights are often just they're protecting the company's interest if it's in the case of a person that works there you know they are protecting the interests of the establishment because if you allow these and again it's not it's not even moralizing go pick up is wrong like you know casual sex is wrong I think that's what a lot of guys think that this sort of behavior is stemming from or like you know these guys are moralizing or they want to get the girls themselves and granted in some cases that may be the case but ultimately especially if it's a worker there they don't want people harassing the patrons so they don't come back and it gets a reputation for fucking creepers that harass girls so I get where they're coming from right I get where they're coming from hell I even get where the guys who don't work there who are like either you know platonic friends of the girl who wanted to hook up with her for years secretly I want wants to bang her him bang her himself doing it to score points and get credit or even just like a Rando commando my stratton even for the honour of women hoping it gets him laid I mean I get what you're where they're coming from to I mean I don't agree with it because I know how to get laid I have pickup skill and I can go out and do that but you know these guys they're gonna in a pathetic world somebody should sound so corny but you know somebody should have my car for real social dynamics but you know in their mind and their belief system and their reality they're just trying to do what they think is best you know but again I'm not gonna begrudge these guys of that because there's no point right what is it what is that old aphorism you know hating someone is like poisoning yourself and hoping they die so it's not gonna change their fuckin mind it's not going to change anything so ultimately how do you deal with this stuff stuff your own game up man take responsibility for reactions have some have some emotional acuity to see what's going on and again don't get defensive when these guys come up be respectful cool you know don't overly engage them you know and give them more fuel to like cling on to and get their foot in the door more you know just like a simple acknowledgement you know ignore and at that point it's up to the curls to you know either tell them tell you to fuck off or tell them to fuck off at the end of the day that's what's going on now granted one could one could also argue that sometimes these girls the so-called White Nights are in their social circles so they're under increased social pressure not to look a certain way in front of these guys and so on and so forth and that's a legitimate thing as well and but you know what ultimately that's part of the game that we have to contend with and like I said when push comes to shove on the bottom line is we can whine and we can complain about the parameters of the game these things happen in like any game nothing's gonna work 100% of the time but you do your best you understand that the onus is on you to come correct not to whinge and whine about externalities okay so hopefully thing helped you get your head on straight with regards to these guys practice makes perfect get out there keep going on can keep keep on keeping on as they say I don't know who they are but I'm sure they're really smart and you know trust that perfection is not the key that's not we were striving before you're striving for consistency because if you go out consistently and you're intelligent about the growth results are inevitable it's been chef please like and subscribe and be on the lookout is next week I'm relaunching the Jeffie hot seat transformational experience and I've got a lot of unique experiential things involved with this hot seat that I think a lot of people are really gonna love what I've been doing this hot seat the two biggest questions that I get are Jeff you're a very you know verbally witty guy you've had a lot of ability to spin humor how can I do that and so I have a tailor the exercises in this new Jeffy transformational haunting experience to cater to those questions that cater keeps you and what to elevate that sharp wit and you'll quick ability to use humor to get girls anyway see you next time,F0iOtTy5Wxw
okay so let's do a quickie little breakdown on what happened there and I would have time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the sets that that set 80% of the time this is the problem hey hi Three's motherfucker a good evening he doesn't know why the girlfriend he'll cup with him so by the finest function she this is the roof of the mouth right here oh right yes [Music] smelling something nice touching the shoulders ah that's the touchdown right they're not just being loud but being clear so that's right sometimes people will say what they heard you they heard the noise  good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps of cheese and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding that was good so uncomfortable  ok clenching it here in order to yes and that's what we don't want ok that's we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow they're swollen this is probably what my boss's cords look like Island City hasn't made any spawned for this book you talking about oh I'm like literally cringing she was actually my voice so it's like oh like average above average but yours is like a baby [Music] yes don't do this don't mix it down shut up bum blah do it to get down here down here yeah yeah yeah get down your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a to mate where we're telling stories do you want to be more excited or do you need to be more like calm and collected and that'll change often dynamically during the interaction itself it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of long-term help for your voice you're going to be able to go out and protect take your finger like this and push it push it and then and that weird and so weird to think when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I truly believe it if only a matter of time until they like awesome and now they're addicted I love it my family gave me a huge awareness of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicality behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling in Toomer sadani personal no father like hello Colin you know my right that you know some little act and that's mostly quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game contest as like a wacky trick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve we're so so so long [Music]  you  Oh,F16zmsLk3qE
yo yo yo what's up it's Jeffy coming at you today from my house in San Francisco being a coach like an executive coach with RSD a bootcamp instructor it's a lot like being a doctor in the ER ever since I started doing this I've seen guys come to our programs in a panic about a variety of things you know their inability to open groups consistently paralyzing inner game issues terrible fashion sense so on and so forth and you have the equivalents of the gunshots car accidents and strokes that you'll see showing up in emergency room along the course this 10-year journey rst has earned a reputation as a company that solves problems we like the rep to and we're proud that it's been a long long time since we've encountered a problem with a guy's game that we couldn't fix and fix fast usually taking a bootcamp or any any diversity program can context even the most hardcore problems by pumping up your confidence setting up new belief systems or sometimes just straight-up smacking you in the head and turning you around 180 degrees if you're headed in the wrong direction sometimes however we have to go right to the heart of the problem and start rearranging things from the ground up oftentimes the problems are is plain fundamental you know it's it's simple when we have to work with clients who are more savvy about social interaction but when you have a client who's not it's a bit like you know you're starting starting a race 10 feet behind the starting line and you've got to play a very fast game of catch-up so like a doctor quickly checking vital signs I learned to do a rapid check up on the basics of any patient and the basics are the first thing you want to look at you know I've done my own checklist in my head now because I've been doing this for so long um but when I started out before I had a lot of experience with different kind of flaws and guys game I had a scramble about kind of figure out what was going on so this checklist that I'm gonna go over today uh it was created a long time ago when I was still being astonished at how fundamental most solutions were a bad game I found this checklist recently again when I was digging through some old files on my hard drives and they were originally just some notes I scribbled down during a post workshop debrief with the guys at 6:00 a.m. in London like two three we were wide awake after the program flight to catch at 8:00 so we just stayed up until dawn talking game and when I found it I knew exactly what it was this list served me very well my early days of coaching but you got understand nothing whatsoever has changed about the fundamentals since then nor will they ever change so this list should serve you well - checklist point number one is voice tonality and delivery aside from body language this is probably the biggest thing I see missing in most guys game the fact of the matter is you cannot build a traction with a girl if she can't hear you okay you can't mumble and thumb with your opener and expect to get a good response you need to project your voice from the diaphragm for me it's it's a bit easy as years and years and years of karaoke training have made the second nature to me but for a lot of guys it feels unnatural to do that to project furthermore it's sometimes necessary to raise the pitch of your voice in order to to alter the pitch because in order to cut through the loud music playing in most clubs this is also a good excuse not that you really need one to speak closely to her inner ear and finally start paying attention to the rhythm of your communication so rhythm expressions sexuality are the beasts things are all intertwined so it's important to to have like a smooth flow and you know modulate that dynamically check this point number two just as smoothing it smoothening out a guy who's too jittery oftentimes I'll see you guys roll up to a girl and they deliver their opener and then they'll start making these like weird like jerky I had movements like they're having a freaking seizure or something and the girls just like what the fuck other times like weird spastic and gestures or maybe there's like shifting from foot to foot incessantly in any case it's not long before the girls start giving each other the that let's get the hell out of your I code bye bye the point is these things are so communicating a lack of confidence so while your words might be those of a suave James Bond type the subtext is that of Steve Urkel so take a deep breath and relax this is not this is not brain surgery checklist point number three be more playful and this is another key one and it's related to the previous one in the sense that the perpetrator here is taking things way too seriously and the difference is in this case the guy is acting like he's an appointee for the Supreme Court being interrogated by the Senate Judiciary Committee it was all business stone-faced getting Curt matter-of-fact responses to everything the Sheikh says okay what you got understand is that when when the ladies hit the club they're there to have fun not to engage in some sort of job interview okay so loosen up have a little fun yourself don't be afraid to act foolish joke around see that's the thing the guy the Stifel person he's afraid to have fun because he thinks he'll look stupid and in turn this is again it's it's some communicating all the wrong things even though you think it's making you look cool it makes you look does not it's having the opposite effect sub communicating insecurity so again joke around be playful check this point number four focus all mental energy what I mean by this is it's essentially being present you got to silence the chatter in your head when you approach a woman out when you're out the only thing you should be thinking about is what's unfolding as you go in not what might happen or could happen you know a lot of times guys will will make it you know we'll review these like mental movies in our head of what could what's going to go wrong and of course this is purely speculative you have no idea how any given sets gonna go you might you know you did girl you think my that's going to be a total bitch like the hot chick there's a total bitch you roll up she's like the nicest person in the world oh hey she's making a bitch face for some reason I do their hand you see some white girls we go this would be an easy approach you go up at their state fuck off so again you never know speculation is is inadmissible in the court of play all right so again look consider this so you see want to be present you want to be present just go up see what happens but again take into consideration the following a social interaction is a living breathing dynamic during the course of which infinite number of things can occur all right think about that given that doesn't make sense you would need as much processor speed in your head like it's humanly possible in order to see what's happening decide on a proper course of action and respond instantly dynamically as its as its unfolding of course it does right if you're sitting there cycling through failure scenarios in your head that's not going to do anything but rob you of that precious brain power and worse the internal pollution is actually going to taint the broadcast and you'll inadvertently end up giving an insecure vibe so don't do it stay present pay attention to what's happening in front of you without judgment and roll from there check this point number five is directing the conversation frame control I guess is another way to put this another thing that screws up most people on a fundamental level is a lack of frame control controlling the frame means controlling the context and the direction of the conversation it's being commanding so many guys will hear an unfavorable comment and they'll just deflate and give up ok or maybe the girl will say something negative about them and they fall into it by addressing it like to be like you shouldn't have done that like oh well it's just the dude to do I mean oh dude and he starts like discussing it then they start going down that conversational thread the next thing you know the discussion is out of their control and now they're faced with the distasteful choice of either you know trying to dig themselves out of the hole they've created or just giving up and ejecting at this point many guys do the latter and and frankly I probably would too so it's best to prevent things from getting that point in the first place that means cutting off threads that work against you means talking over people who are saying things in the condi don't leave the conversation the ways I wanted to go sometimes it just might mean flagrantly changing the subject with a ridiculous non sequitur whatever works for in control you know this ability to lead the conversation it can be it can be a difficult thing to learn but I cannot stress this enough it's absolutely necessary checklist point number six move things forward have you ever seen that movie Glengarry Glen Ross the motto of the city if you haven't you should check it out it's really awesome specifically the at the phase alec baldwin seen you can just google that you'll see what I'm talking about very very motivating but in any case the motto of the Salesman movie is ABC always be closing a B C they always be B C closing always be closing always be closing you hear me you fucking faggots and this is the motto of the successful player as well if he's trying to call it approach pick up now don't get me wrong here I don't mean you should just go to women and try to yank them back to your place in the shortest amount of time possible right a lot of guys here you know about these bathroom poles and he's like 10-minute poles and stuff these superhero antics a lot of the instructors or even other guys on the forum they're like wow they get this sort of unrealistic assessment I think that's happening all the time all right it happens from time to time sure but but generally you know from meat to pole to leave the club together a sample is gonna be like 45 90 minutes so the thing is you got to take things one step at a time it's on a race by the same token however I do get frustrated when I see guys talking to these girls for hours on end without doing anything to escalate things towards a situation where things are gonna get physical where they can get physical like it's been three hours and they haven't even touched her arm and the reason for this is frankly because they're afraid to get blown out like they think oh it's going great she's laughing at my jokes and we're vibing really well I better not screw it up by trying to escalate a news flash man if they're sticking around it's highly likely that they know what's going on and they expect you to escalate you see these girls have reasonable expectations that you're going to step up at some point and take things to the next level so don't let them down it's just tacky remember once it girls are attracted to you there's only a short window of time which you can strike so to speak and what's that window is done like close you're done so again always be moving always know where you're at in the interaction and know where you want to go and always be taking oh is the active mixture actively taking model yourself make sure actively taking steps forward in that direction the next checklist points was facial expressions so this one kind of ties in but number three it's about being expressive a touristy we've in the past to find game as being the expression of your inner state conveyed by the rhythms that you use to direct the energy of the social interaction some of these guys that see in the field they're they're talking to girls and they look like a like a marble bust of George Washington or something all right maybe that strong silent type shit works in certain situations but again we're going for a consistency here folks all right when I'm in said I'm interacting with girls out in public frequently I mean they're mugging like like fucking Jim Carrey okay so I'll have this like dumb smirk on my face let's be like other times I'll look at them like job might be judging like like like self-deprecating et cetera et cetera you know it all depends on the energy that I'm getting from the girl in the moment so I calibrate and I react accordingly you know there x-hundred number of muscles in your face I don't know it's like some really big number and these let you express an almost infinite range of emotions through the face and what this allows you to do you can really become quite skillful skillful with this and it allow you to to fine-tune sort of the energy of the interaction you could really develop kind of a true artistry with this so look try it now go to the mirror and make as many faces as you possibly can go ahead do it nobody's looking and if they are at least you'll entertain them  okay that's enough you're beginning to frighten me you know I used to do this back when I was was starting out I'd like a bug and exercise like mug in the mirror as an exercise I don't do it like you know before I go out to keep you know kind of really see what range of emotions I can express look they say that old saw you know 90% of communication is nonverbal and a huge portion of that it comes from the expression on your face the next checklist point is standing too far away and this is similar to number six obviously you don't want to spook the girl and roll right out by getting two inches from her face right off the bat obviously you know Julian Tyler a lot of guys will practice more of the beast mode style these guys can get away with that but the thing is they're highly highly calibrate form years nears doing this also they're very centered when they go up and do it it's clearer than I try to weasel their way into the party but I was like a new guy off and see you know something guys they're not scared but they but they just go up and they just get right in her face like a dog like against training at the end of a chain right off the bat so again it's not good it's kind of creepy is basically just asking for rejection so you wanna you want to approach what kind of a non-threatening body light was a non-threatening vibe newer guys they really don't know how to do that without coming off as scary and weird okay so when they think of aggressive they that's what they think they think like aggressive like scary they don't know how to be aggressive not in a scary way but in a fun and cool way okay but even that even with that at some point you do have to get close to the girl it's just a fact all right you know nothing is going to happen if you stay at arm's length so get your ass thrown into the fucking friendzone at best you know unless you are able to astrally project your dong then at some point you're gonna have to touch the girl and if you are able to actually protect your dog please email me because I would like to take your boot camp okay so so again you got a cut in you know all usually get all up in the girl space as soon as I know I've hooked them right sometimes I'll do a hard stop and get up in their grill too but but generally then I'll back off and like act nor and then I'll start to just move on in so as I poke them and you know what does that mean the hook point that's basically the point where the girls have stopped thinking why is this guy talking to me and now they've kind of shifted over to thinking I hope this guy doesn't stop talking to me this is interesting so it doesn't mean I have to stay right in a grill I can back off just abruptly as I went in it all goes back to calibration to give and take the point is I get in there ASAP and you should too that brings us to the final point of the checklist which is playing a character this is a bit of a funny one I usually see this when you have a guy on program he's you know read a lot of Theory watched a lot of stuff in and who maybe came up with more of the scripted it routines to style but you know he can't he comes in he has a lot of lines and gimmicks under his belt and so forth although this isn't always the case clues will be the case you know but but in any case in this what happens is the guy he's going and he's saying things that should sound smooth that should sound cool things that a cool guy would say but you know he sounds like he's kind of reading it from a script like like it's a little too cool all right I used to suffer from this uh because you know I was a huge routine monkey back in the day wish I hadn't gone through that but but you know whatever it is what it is but but it you know but back then it's kind of again it's like something is not exactly adding up here okay like like it some kind of actor like big girls laughing are you a comedian are you an actor and if it sounds like a good actor it's like a bad actor in an after-school special like a cheesy after-school special about the evils of players or something so it wasn't often pretty so think of it like this it's like when you you go and you shoot a whole movie and oftentimes you'll see people like put on some weird narrator voice like and here's the kitchen okay it's not genuine and you do this because you know this is something that might be potentially viewed by thousands of people and it's a defense mechanism against I guess being perceived in certain ways so guys do this in field it's the same thing it's a defense mechanism they put on the character to keep the real self safe from rejection the irony of it of course this actually tells the cause rejection life sucks huh believe it or not though most people and especially women they'll have a keen sense of when somebody's faking sincerity so unless you'd like some sort of acclaim Shakespearean actor like the great Sir Patrick Stewart you're you're probably better off keeping it genuine you know not playing some some character you know authenticity is always going to win out so anyway that's the checklist I'm not suggesting that you write this thing down and carry it around with you nor is it meant to be some kind of comprehensive cure-all these however are just some of the most common mistakes that we see you guys making feel so right now just take a quick inventory and see if you're guilty video for guys with a lot of experience it might seem simplistic but there's no doubt that the basics are what get violated the most so again use your uses checklist on yourself until it becomes second nature and use it when you're doing triage so to speak on someone else's sick game you'll be surprised to see how frequently the answer is the simplest thing in the world Katy oh hey oh hey oh oh attention attention hey wait wait wasn't your car fresh balls,F1JDOkL1330
good day and welcome once again to the channel of your proverbial boi jetty and I'm just kicking it here in San Francisco California about to shoot off to Chicago Illinois this weekend for the wonderful hot seat program on the 25th of March and you know had a little week off here in San Francisco Tyler actually came up Nick and Owen came up and to discuss the musical about RSD that Nick is creating and it's going to be like when he said this thing to me I was like wow this seems like a little one-off you know side project he's doing and then we show up and he's like meet me at the Westin in the presidential suite and I go up there they're like 20 people in there he's assembled all of these like choreographers for Rihanna and like a set-piece guy from Broadway and a dude from wu-tang Nicole Arbour is there for some reason to help Mike map out the production and apparently I have a song in it where I'm like crying in the van after being like severely beaten I'm talking about in the song how you know like the van is my suit of armor inside the band I'm a rock I'm an island I cannot be harmed our tortoise shell backing me from the efficient and vindictive outside world so kind of like you know memory is all alone in the moonlight type of thing and apparently it's a lot more in-depth than I thought but then again that's Nick for you he'll just go whole hog on an idea and he'll assemble the people which is interesting because you know I've thought about this a lot Tony Robbins I believe was the guy who brought up the idea that in business you've got three kinds of people there's the entrepreneur and entrepreneur will you know he's like the idea guy he'll come up with a big picture idea he will you know marshal the resources necessary to make it a reality they'll get the capital he'll find the experts that can handle the individual moving parts and bring all those people together and bring all that stuff together and make it happen then so you've got the managers and a manager excels at handling the day-to-day administration of you know the business things like making sure you know making sure the trains run on time so to speak making sure that everyone's being held accountable making sure that all of the different departments are kind of communicating with each other and and that things are getting done on time right the customers are being satisfied and then of course you've got the artist and the artist he doesn't even care about money like he'll forget to get paid if you don't tell him you know he just wants to do his little fucking art and and put it out he isn't he's like oh I was supposed to get paid oops now I'm broke so you know a business should have all of these people and in fact when we first start like I'm almost pure artist you know that's why it takes me a long time to put something out because I have a very perfectionist mentality when it comes to you know creating you know my creative output but you know obviously Nick pure entrepreneur myself almost pure artist Owen almost pure artist but the thing is we didn't really have in our sd someone fulfilling that management role so we were kind of - like like these these artists that were like trying to be a bastardized manager as well so now finally like ten years deeply we are even further we decided look you know we need to get to streamline a lot of these processes and make sure that somebody's handling that because obviously we can't so that's kind of a big part of not just success in business but success in you know other areas of your life whether it's Fitness finances etc it's like knowing knowing what your strengths are and also being aware of the concomitant weaknesses that come along with that particular role that you have you know if you're one of those three or you have obviously a lot of people are gonna be a mixture of those but you know being aware and being able to delegate you know and being able to bring people in and it's very difficult delegating I mean this is a lesson that Tyler myself I have struggled with because at the end of the day when you're doing something creative you're like well you know what only I can do it the way I want it you know the way I'm envisioning so you're very reluctant to kind of hand your baby over to someone to to do work on because you're not entirely confident that they're going to be able to fulfill your vision for the project right but you know at a certain point you've got to realize you can't do it all yourself and Lord knows we try you know we like execute the program I did all the design stuff you know all those little like sprite figures of me you know in like the 8-bit world you know I did commissioned somebody to do the 8-bit theme song for that up you know all the video editing all the filming etc etc it's like it's just exhausting and you're like you can't keep this up long term and that kind of dovetails with the topic that was on my mind originally I got kind of sidetracked there but so yeah so when Owen was here we we went to the Hamilton you know we had the musical production meeting and I went to the show Hamilton which I hadn't seen before it just came into San Francisco and it's fucking awesome like literally just to see I mean I'm not a huge musicals guy even though I am a rather musical fellow I'm not really under like show tunes and things of that nature but you know it's there's really nothing that's been done like that in like the Broadway Canon is for I'm aware but yeah it really blew me away to seem to stagecraft seeing the the amount of effort that goes into that production and you know was really again interesting just to see the story of Alexander Hamilton with the founding fathers of the United States like put out like that in the history of the country and kind of like two parallel things going on it really got me thinking in you know creative ways but here's the point after that you know following day I went to the the banya there's like this Russian bath out here in the Bayview that I always go to and I went to that with Anya you know you go into the hot sauna and then jump into the cold plunge and they have this thing called a Plaza where like a burly Dyke beats you with sticks inside like a 200 200 degrees Russian sauna and you feel like you're going to pass out and it's quite taxing I mean the idea is that the essential oils in the birch sticks or something you know draw out toxins or some homeopathic or shit I mean maybe it fucking works I don't know I mean a sedated poor that's like cool water on you and then you know yesterday I actually went to uh I went to a different spa and I got like a facial and you know they put all this shit on my face and told me how beautiful my skin is for a 41 year old man which is kind of nice I never really go outside I'm kind of an endorsee type so that I'm sure that helps you know except at night that's why they call me vampire Potter just funny because I was out the other night and for some reason I was introducing myself as vampire Potter might call me vampire vampire Potter like my name used to be hairy but now I go by vampire because I'm gothic so and then I you know I pulled I pulled a young lass and we had a time in the van which was wonderful and again I insisted she referred to me as a vampire Potter the entire time in not coincidentally well actually yes coincidentally this was number 100 in the van so that was a milestone me hooking up with a girl half my age who's 21 in a van while going by the name vampire Potter but again humor their point be and I went to the spa so you're saying like what are all these like bougie foo-foo activities are doing one thing that I learned from Owen is that when you are a self-starter you're on your path you're a hustler you're a motherfucking hustler you have to make sure that in your downtime your recreational activities are regenerative as opposed to deleterious okay so the idea being work hard play soft essentially you know you hear that old phrase work hard play hard the danger is when you get to burning the candle at both ends you know and for me personally I know a lot of the time if I've had in the past I've had the tendency to kind of just go ham on my gaff like if I don't have a boot camp I'm not traveling I happen to be here in town I would be like ooh weekend off what do I do get get fucking hammered and likes it's become fucking intoxicated and then you wake them you feel worse like again that downtime it's supposed to regenerate you so you can hit it again just like Bruce Lee talked about in you know the art of the Dow jeet kune do-- with after every strike there's a period of like collecting the energy for the next so if that's an important integral and absolutely necessary part of the cycle if you want to be able to hustle long term now again if you're like a super young guy you're full of piss and vinegar and you just got like this boundless energy you know you're like 18 to 21 this meant this may not seem that necessary and it probably isn't that necessarily because because you can you know shove garbage down your fucking throat you can eat Taco Bell and fucking like things out of the trash all day long and not get fat and all this but of course there's going to be a bill to pay later on but that's why it's good to sort of begin at least to instill those habits so you're not playing catch-up later like what's happening now I feel like shit all the time so as an old man you know Uncle Jesse drunkle drunk Uncle Jesse I i I've seen how I operate over time and the thing is like myself Tyler Derek Julian max in many ways were like I always joked like this were like Formula one cars you know we operated a very high level when we're going out and we're handling our business on the road where you know it's landing setting up our free tours conducting those programs breaking you know setting up breaking down going right to boot camps setting up hot feet conducting coffee into boot camp on an airplane back home editing videos you know working on mantras collaborating with other instructors going oh having all these meetings and stuff so we operate on a very high level but again if just like with a Formula One car if something breaks it's like blank and like the whole shit those beers off the road and that's when I see a lot of the younger guys who's first start they travel incessantly for years at a time and it takes a toll on them mentally like they they can become depressed they can become confused they can be they can have a feeling of being unworried from reality because they're never in one spot you know for more than like a couple days so it again I always tell this to them I go hard but at some point you're going to have to to rest and when you do you want that rest that recreation to be regenerative so that's why we do things like we go to the banya we go and again who knows it's being beaten with sticks by a burly Dyke in a towel even does anything but it's you know it's something to do that's actually restful and it's actually you know it's different it's interesting and it's not fucking you up more another thing would be food you know a lot of guys and I know Julian did this when he was he had you know he after his whole Julianne gate thing you know his vice was an alcohol it was food and he would go out to like nice restaurants and she's like trial these different things shove this fuckin this shit down his gullet and what was the result you know he became you know overweight and then it took him a lot of time to recover from that and you know get back to like normalcy you know but again it's so it's being aware of those tendencies you have of the kind of years of life deep the the allure of those debilitating recreational endeavors right and look I enjoy good cocktails much of the next guy I'm not saying like you need to be just abstain guy anything like that but be aware and if you are going to engage in those behaviors look I mean I went out to this dinner at this place called nc2 in San Francisco here this week as well so I have like a whole like downtime week where I did all these kind of cultural things and went to the spa and get all this stuff rest meditate hit the gym you know would increase the bigger because you know you're got my own gym here and everything like that and again this place in situ it's crazy it's of the music SFMOMA Museum of Modern Art and what they do is the idea is kind of this curated menu of dish famous dishes from around the world and so that was cool to go to but again if I'm like eating at that shit every night like shoving this like rich French food like all this shit like gourmand food down my throat I'm going to probably feel sluggish rundown fucked up even though technically even eating like it you know if I eat it like Gorman dinner every night in San Francisco is probably better than eating my fucking Applebee's you know at least your body recognizes that stuff is real food not Applebee's the you know the gore man shit because the ingredients are so high-quality and stuff but still again you've got to be aware like if you're if you have those tendencies do it in moderation and then also temper this with more regenerative restful activities right so again now I'm ready to go out and hit it in fact I McNown excited to go out of hit it right I'm excited to get back on the road I'm refreshed you know okay I've been kicking around here for a while let's get back at it get on the road boots on the ground across America and the world meet you the people and shake your fucking hand and tell preps tell a little joke and show some of my little videos that will you know theoretically elucidate and provide some edification for you in your goals with the opposite sex and romance in the night anyways quick little video want to shoot it off here I got some meetings about today about the upcoming resonator vocal projection product which is designed to lift you out of the morass of shame and pain that you encounter when attempting to approach women this there's a program is really good for new guys who can't cook and and this is one of the reason I developed a resonator program was because I would see guys that are going up to girls in the venue and they're trying to open and they the girls won't even look at them or if they do it's just kind of like a like like a like brushing a fly out of their fucking hair or something like that like literally I call these guys potted plants pieces of furniture because that for all intents and purposes they may be may as well be a piece of furniture in the club because we're just ignoring them because their voice is so thin and weak and even if I try to coach these guys to talk louder it's like literally death they think that's as loud as they can go but there's all kinds of little tricks tips and awareness of the apparatus of how it's working that you can employ you can leverage to make your voice more powerful I don't care who you are anyone on this planet can gain a powerful vocal projection through the application of the techniques that are going to be outlined in this program resonator look for it coming in June it's not for the VIP list right now if you so desire and I highly encourage you to do so please also like and subscribe as always and I'll see you next week on my fucking I'm going to give you access to the hot girls you don't see it's a club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cut through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that completely automates the process to getting dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do this is execute the program version 2.0 the ruthlessly efficient highly repeatable systems for the modern day online gangster if over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of the infield footage broken down case networks and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you power that night I cover the exact repeatable Taba takes to take a girl home nearly 85% of the time she agrees to meet up this is my online masterpiece at bottom line - just plain works now you have a choice to make keep using the Internet to beat off or use it to have someone else read it off sport so decide how fast you want to start getting laid and execute the program [Music],F8bCetQksSs
go it up the tree Boyd Jeffy I'm here today in Austin Texas on Rainey Street about to pop into boot camp I should get a free tour here last night and during this free tour one of the attendees asked me a question about to go for comfort in an interaction and when to go for attraction now the conventional wisdom for people who don't study this stuff is that first you go in and you speak to them and you get comfortable first you get them comfortable with you first and then once they're comfortable then you go for attraction I'm gonna make sense if you think about it right well I'm here to tell you that this is ass backwards and wrong and I'm gonna explain why in the video so that further ado  all right so we've got an inquiry something that they want explored show of hands anyone yeah up front can you go over the techniques you use you have from small parts from our romantic oh yeah so it's it's interesting because I think that that's one of the biggest hurdles against faces they're like okay so I'm in here doing this small talk so to speak right and what does it consist of so what's your name where do you did it done it up now here's the thing this requires a deeper fundamental shift in your and how you're looking at it so just by virtue of the way you ask the question it suggests to me that your metalia right now is first you go up and you do the small talk and then you change it to that should this attraction so first I get comfort then I go for attraction right well that's wrong now why is that wrong it makes sense right why would you want to go for attraction with somebody who isn't comfortable with you yet test the waters well here's the problem I mean it makes sense conventional wisdom says first you go up you chitchat and then you start to take it there right well the problem with this is when you start asking them all these questions which is the most typical form that comfort takes so what's your name where do you live what do you do etc etc if they if they do not have attraction towards you there's no reason for them to want you to know the answers to these questions so for example let's imagine you're walking down the street and you're out like a stoplight and some dude comes down not even a homeless dude just some dude is like a man how's it going how's it going man oh cool what's your name oh cool where do you live sweet if you like it yeah what do you do oh cool what's that like it's like who the fuck are you why are you asking me these things right so again would you go up and do that the girls like okay this again oh great this from some Rando I don't even know and you know I get as like I said a lot of times when guys do it approach like Oh finally a guy doing an approach and then you'll see that excitement fade very quickly into like oh another one of these it's got to be like 20 minutes of these questions I hear every night maybe if I'm lucky he'll throw a hand on the lower back - all right like that's his bold move so what you'll notice is when we go in we're going for attraction first and then once that you get attraction you're either going to get it quickly or it's not going to happen at all right so we go in and almost right off the bat I'm gonna go and with like a self-amusing opener I might say one of my personal favorites is excuse me have you have you ever met someone cool before oh now you have hi I'm Jeff or hey excuse me hi I'm Jeff and people like me for me or I might say hey good evening hi yes I'm the next idiot of the night speaking with you or am I the first do I have the honor of being the first idiot to speak with you this evening no yeah I probably won't be the last either hey what's up I'm Jeff roll into it from there so so self-amusing over and then from there I'm almost immediately starting in with the statements of intent like you look really well put together this evening you're in the fashion industry in some capacity I love your look it's hot so anyway like it was saying blah blah blah blah blah and then like chitchat now I'm not asking questions you should wean yourself off asking questions one of my mentors in the early days he said like you've read my of course it's like it seems like you ask a lot of these questions so one kind of trick he gave me was don't phrase anything in the form of questions like the opposite of Jeopardy what you want to app what you want run instead like let's say you want to know information how would you how would you get them to tell you that information yes if you like make a statement instead that leads them to tell you the answer that so you know what you look like you're from dirty dirty dirty X Y Z like no I'm actually from here like Oh like I'm actually from Austin oh that's crazy I heard people from Austin or sex addicts anyway like I was saying blah blah blah blah he stole that from Derek you know anything Dempster I start peppering in these statements of intent right off the bat secondly actually even before I start doing that when I approach I approach from where the front to say I'm here to engage you and I'm communicating a lot with eye contact as well like one of our old instructors this guy named Tim he used to say you want to be kind of dangerous from the word hey like from the moment you go off you're like hey good evening like oh this dude will hook up like there's no ambiguity a lot of times these guys talk to her what does this guy even hear for what is he doing the asexual is he's gay does he want to be my friend like what's happening here I don't know so you have to own it you have to own the fact that you're going up there to hit on it because let's face it they know why you're going up especially in a nightclub environment they know why you're there so if you if you default to this hey what's going on what do you do where do you it's like they can't even respect it so come on man why the charade why this whole charade why you got to be like this so but mind you now when I go up these these sticks so I Square up looking him in the eye communicating sexual intent with my eyes you know some with a smirk on the face enjoying it remember they're not attracted to the content what are they attracted to the vibe it's not the logical content of what you're saying it's how do they feel while you're while you're saying it right so if they feel good they'll stay the vibing the conversation is the extensible reason for them to keep standing there talking to you while you do what methodically move it forward so I go in again I say it's Dave another 10 almost right off the bat so they know what I'm there for and then I'll start ratcheting up those statements of intent you know the camper here making me feel weird in the dick but hey was sorry sorry yeah I hear myself talking like what did you say that was good say that again but anyway yes I did it and then go mourn normal for a little bit and then it's like a Cosby peppering these things in I'm constable comments in and here's another thing a lot of guys will say the comment the statement of the tent and then they'll kind of like wait there on pause for the reaction like you're hot like ah do you like it like what do you think of my comment like that are you are hot right and then what does that do why is that bad well it's not just looking for approval that's like putting pressure on ER now make the decision what's your answer to if you want to have sex with me right now answer you know it's like whoa do too much so you want your vibing is like a river and then the statements of a tenor like a little pebble that gets dropped in it's like it's on to the next so it's almost like a subliminal it in a way you know or it's just woven into the fabric of the conversation itself and it's not like this you're putting a spotlight on the escalation you know you're just talking your vibe bye bye bye bye bye bye and then you're Sergeant Pepper in like these gave him some attend every now and then and as they they ramped up and become more explicit you know up to the point where it's like I'd love to Eskimo kiss your pussy I like to suck my own dick that's not really the same way that's that but you know it is what it is yeah maybe one that I've been using recently is a GM girl you don't even know what I want to do to you right now you have no idea what I want to do to you right now she's like what like I just want to get to know you over a period of several months and meet your peer group and perhaps engage in some activities with them maybe Ultimate Frisbee perhaps get into a long-term relationship have children together watch them grow up move out of the house achieve their hopes dreams and aspirations and then hold hands and our golden years and die in love that's what I want to fucking do to you right now girl come on how many nasty motherfucker you better ask somebody anyway like I was saying blah blah blah blah blah in their arms or whatever I was talking about the vibing I'm just using basically free association whatever they said is free associate and I talked with with enthusiasm I'm happy to be there I mean happy eyes I'm enthusiastic about life so a buddy of mine who's very very good at game my next student in fact you became like upper echelon at this stuff he said to me this is like Jeff game essentially in a nutshell is this everybody's bored give him something different to talk about and then make it easy for her to go home and you would not feel guilty about it so what's that given something different to talk about well give him something different talk loud means your unstyled your expressive you're putting your personality on the chopping block on the line you're you're sharing with them you're not trying to weasel you're not trying to get in the set you're just sharing you're collaborating with them that's the mentality cuz the way when you go up to it you're like I need to hook the set I gotta hook the set what does that set you up for so yeah exactly it's a win-lose it's like if I hope to set I succeeded if it doesn't work I am diminished I am less I am you know I've failed and so your night tends to go down and down the thing is to like boot camp I'm looking to see on the first night especially this is more the diagnostic night where I want to kind of see what they're doing I'm looking what they're doing in the interactions but I'm also looking how they're coming out of the interactions because that'll often be more telling of what they need to work on so let's say you have a continuum I know once I have to continuum you got this guy he goes in and then the girls like a nice to meet you and leaves and he's just like  and he likes trudges back over to me Jeff okay I'm in a bad state man that's it now when this guy shows up you know what I'm gonna say for this what how do you think I'm gonna respond to this no I'm not even gonna acknowledge it like it's unhelpful anything that does not contribute to success will be it's not given oxygen so I'll be like thought about balls to her and like just throw another girl on or something like immediately like it like just a nod to the next don't don't even think about this right so beyond that that guy's night is gonna go down and down you know he's gonna be circling the drain of despair he's gonna go into like a shame spiral like want want want more right now on the other end of the spectrum and they get these are just like hypothetical guys the other extreme is the guy who who goes in the rows like Jer you're down and leaves and he's just like okay well that fucking sucks oh good morning alright what's the next man what's next he just thinks it's a complete joke that guy that's gonna go up and up and up I see a guy like that I'm like this guy's gonna succeed because he's not taking it seriously now get easier said than done especially you've got all the social conditioning wrapped up in it but so again just go up and vibe start peppering in statements of intent almost immediately then start layering in physicality and again those little examples I gave earlier those are just a couple of examples feel free to feel free to plagiarize them if you'd like but ideally you want to get to the point where you're actually developing your own and every one that I say I came up with spontaneously at one point and then I was able to you know I just collated I just compiled them by the way though I put a lot of my statements of intent on autopilot I also put a lot of my openers on autopilot I always put I also put a lot of my physical escalations on autopilot now why do I do that is it because I've been capable of improvisation is that the case no they're doing a sixteen-year is a very capable of improvisation the reason I do that is I don't want to be in the weeds I don't want to be down here at ground level thinking about what to say or do next it's like boom fire this one fire this one fire this fire listen why I'm on a meta-level I'm up here monitoring certain things I don't want to be look what do I say now that's on audible I'm up here what am i monitoring number one what is her emotional state right now what is she giving me emotionally how can I fine tune my ain't my approach so it kind of harmonizes with what she's giving me right now number two what for logistical situation other obstacles that need to be circumnavigated can I do that how is it evolving and then number three where am I in the eight steps of the pickup and how do I get from this step to the next step what are the behaviors I need to be doing right now to do that right that's what I'm focusing on I'm not focusing what I say what do I say so very it can be very useful to sort of put a couple of think those things on autopilot but basically again answer the original question how do you take it from comfort is comfortable like chitchat get to know

solo okay cool like what do you what do you do where do you live admin bill the requisite comfort so she feels okay like  you [Music],FFm-ZpY7Fbo
[Applause] [Music] hey what's up guys is Jeff coming at you from Auckland New Zealand it's a bit rainy out here today we've had an exciting weekend a lot of mold digging and rooting and drilling and other vulgar euphemisms have been taking place so I'm out here on the balcony is good see we're looking at Queen Street the camera is waterproof but I'm not so we're gonna try to make this as a swift little little blog today I want to talk about the importance of being dynamic in your game now what does that mean well what's the opposite of dynamic that would be what static okay dynamic in motion static not moving and this we're talking about this I'm talking this over like wide range of modalities including you know first off when you're like escalating on a go what's nine times out of ten look guys I see like newbies coming into the game I see them there and like trying to interact physically with girls and a lot of times it's just very big first night a program when I go out with these guys I'll tell them I give them very little instruction I just tell them okay look I just want you to step these girls I want you to escalate on them the way that you would just normally do it and nine times out of ten what do they do well one or two if you've ever seen the flawless natural is that program who talks about the purposeless hand of doom in fact how much you want to come over here and I'll demonstrate this percentage okay yes so see here it's like this we're talking you're blah blah blah blah so there and then it just like sits there for two hours like what the fuck is this supposed to accomplish or perhaps this so perhaps this the the hand on the lower back that sits there and it doesn't move Hey and it just like sits there for two hours all right so we're talking about being dynamic I'm talking to a little son okay let's let's do some quasi homosexual stuff here like yeah like hey like I feel like this we're fucking with and we're constantly dicking around you know we're spinning around we're fucking with their shit it's constantly in motion now alright thanks as far as talking about having a range of emotions okay now if you're a reader of Alexander stuff you might be familiar with this formula track is a function of higher value : emotions in other words you're coming at it from a place of higher value and you have a full engine so you know this is why a lot of times guys will read stuff like us being kind of aggressive or asshole list of the girls like oh my god this is so shocking but what they don't realize is that's just one small part of what we'll bring to the table so for example the other night you know the student he was talking these girls and they kind of go - they're kind of being dismissive of me so I go in there and I start talking I'm like I'm like look why don't you go suck a Penguin's dick and they're like excuse me I'm like look pack your shit get the fuck out you're done in this town you're done in that which makes no sense at all you're done in this town I don't even live here ok right I'm sorry you're done in this town let me show you something little doggie go fetch get the fuck out go fetch if she's like what what and then they start coming back as I'm saying like leave go leave go go leave go go leave and that each time I say go leave she got a lake it comes a little bit closer back and its students watching this it's like oh my god like how do how is this working it's because look oftentimes you know guys are talking to these girls they're like come on come on come on so it's pull pull pull pull pull and oftentimes all you need is one little push to show ok this this guy's not just some meaty pull pull pull pull guy now obviously we like to take it a bit more extreme you know but that's mainly because we're self-amusing now what happens the guys say well how does this what do you do like after this you know the girls get moved likely get quite upset when you're doing this right so what I'm saying go leave go leave like right when they're about to leave then I'll actually go no no no no no no I'm just kidding I'm just kidding what you're not gonna fight for me aren't you gonna fight for me so you just slam it back so again you're not just being this asshole but you're doling that out and small put in small bits ok when necessary all right you're not just doing for the sake of doing it and that's a that's a big negative nothing truly negative a negative expression which is a part of the food kind of expression they use to arouse people and have them react to you so it's not like we're doing this all the time there's a time and place for it and and furthermore you know I think that a lot of guys they're just really nice and I I started out as a nice guy myself you know and so well sort of but you know it's interesting because after seeing these scumbag jerks get the girls by doing this kind of stuff over and over and over because often times like nice guys they aren't willing to do this kind of stuff and so they don't get the girls and what happens well what ends up happening is these girls that end up banging a lot of scumbags you know so Tyler himself you know Julian and that's we've been practicing you know playing around with this style of game more recently it's just like look we're we ultimately have good intentions with the girl but the point is we're just doing willing to do at this point whatever it takes okay so if I have to act like an asshole for a bit it doesn't matter because I know that once once we're together it's gonna be you know it's gonna be more more of a Disney movie with with cherish and chablis okay or at the bare minimum maybe just ejaculating in her ass in a shower stall or as they call in Maori culture cementing the bond okay I think he I think he verified that in fact the other night with his Maori princess that he discovered so yeah long story short it's a long story short there's nothing wrong with like with you know expressing different elements of different facets of your personality okay so in the name of dynamism okay so you want to have dynamic movements dynamic facial expressions like you'll notice you know for those who've been a brute cat with me or even like talking here you'll notice I've got a wide range of expressivity it's expressivity both in the face the hands the way you can iraq physically with them and the way you interact emotionally with them you can give them in a full range of emotions you take them on the roller coaster ride draw them in your world and be willing to do you know to put like don't be all push be will or pull rather you will need to do a little bit of push so having said that i feel like i've washed my coat and hat enough in the lovely New Zealand weather so amazing beautiful I really love this town Ashley it's pretty cool so gonna be gonna be traveling all out through Australia this month real excited about it escaping the San Francisco winter for the southern hemisphere summer quote-unquote anyway hope you enjoyed this hope I illuminated some of these concepts for you a little further and we'll talk to you soon peace [Music]  [Applause]  [Music]  you,FVEhQEasD0A
hey what up it's Jeffy I'm here in Toronto and today I'm going to explore an interesting phenomenon how the thing that you typically want to do the least is the thing that you actually need to do the most now recently I check out a book recommended to me by Owen Cooke aka Tyler called the war of art by Steven Pressfield it's a pretty short book and I actually listen to it on the audio version and just blaze through it on 1.5 speed in an afternoon while I was digging around the house doing some chores and this book really struck a chord with me as I am currently struggling to get several projects that I've had on the back burner for a while off the ground and Pressfield highlights the different forms of resistance faced by artists entrepreneurs athletes and others who are actually trying to break through its barriers and actually get their damn work done now this is going to be a book review here and I'd encourage you to check it out for yourself but there was one very interesting point that stuck out that I'd like to share with you and when describing the different forms of resistance early on the book Pressfield he mentions a unique characteristic of resistance he says resistance will unfailingly point to true north meaning that calling or action it most wants to stop us from doing and we can use this we can use it as a compass we can navigate by resistance letting it guide us to that calling or purpose that we must follow before all others rule of thumb the more important a call or action is to our Souls evolution the more resistance we will feel toward pursuing it so this struck a chord with me personally again because I found to be so very true in my own experience I mean for example the one exercise I've always hated at the gym the most happens to be pull-ups okay you know I was never very good at them I at the most I was able to do like seven at one time and you know I hated him and it got to the point where I'd actually have them scheduled at you know for the day at the gym and once I was at the gym I would actually do every other exercise that I was supposed to do first and then I'd actually like kind of stare at the pull-up bar and look at it and I'd be like well yeah I'm kind of tired now you know you know what I'll just do it at home yeah yeah you know I got a pull-up bar at home my doorway I'll just you know that way I'll be rested and I can actually do them fresh okay cool and of course once I got home I'd immediately start doing other shit and then just completely forget to do the pull-ups and just completely blow them off now this happened again and again and once I noticed a pattern emerging okay I decided to really cut the crap and force myself to step up and do the fucking pull-ups every single time and actually became like a thing like a referendum on my value as a human being now there aren't many things that I'd actually say that about but this was one because it was an area that I wasn't living up to my own standards in okay in fact I was lying to myself or rather resistance was lying to me now flash-forward to today and I go to the gym I'm able to bust out five sets of ten unassisted quite easily in fact I actually looked forward to pull-ups day right and of course that's not even mentioning the myriad strength benefits I've garnered from stepping up and just doing the damn work you know I actually find them fun now and you know I'm even thinking about stepping up to doing muscle ups for you you CrossFit guys and girls who are watching and as far as like let's take it to another level on a work now currently with RSD the projects that I'm feeling the most resistance toward are number one the online game product and number two filming another hot seat now both of these projects are certainly huge undertakings that are going to require massive amounts of time and energy but the very fact that I feel such a violent resistance towards getting the ball rolling on them says one thing these are the things that I need to be devoting the most time to right now for my own evolution and fact one of the reasons that I'm making this blog today is to actually get some leverage and some kind of accountability going on this from the viewers at home  now of course this principle also applies to your own game so ask yourself what area are part of the game do you currently feel the most resistance towards doing right now now for some of you it's going to be the mere fact or act rather of going to the club you know and for you newbies out there let me tell you look I remember very distinctly what it was like to be sitting at home pondering whether to go out or not imagining how how much it was suck and how much in that intimidation I would feel in that environment once I got to the club and of course at the time what did that tell me it told me one thing I need to get the fuck out of the house just put your damn shoes on put your damn coat on and walk out the front door now for other people you might have no problem going to the club but then the problem might be actually approaching okay you're there in the club you see the girl and all of a sudden your feet feel rooted to the ground you know the rationalizations come up almost immediately and that's resistance and what it's telling you is that stepping to that girl is in fact the very thing that you need to do at the moment in order to move your skillset forward and of course I mean it might be anything it could be stepping to hotter girls it could be escalating physically even though you have little experience doing so and it's likely to come across as creepy or awkward okay it can be leaning it could be going for the pole it could be actually pulling the trigger back at the house now whatever it is that you currently feel the most resistance towards at the moment that is in fact the very thing that you need to do the most and in a counterintuitive twist many times that thing actually turns out to be the thing that you enjoy doing the most once you get good at it so this is Jeffie and I'll see you next time Asian fusion and fission fusion and fission fission and fusion and fission fusion

howdy so today I got a question for you have you ever been in a situation where you were talking with somebody and you took something that they said the wrong way in other words you misinterpreted the meaning that they were going for and you got upset only to find out later that it was all in your head okay so an example would be guy one says the guy - about some situation he's like looks like you got the short end of the stick on that one bro and guy 2 has some issues and insecurities surrounding his height he's a short guy right and so he responds what do you mean short you saying I'm short screw you so meanwhile guy number one is left scratching his head and explaining that no that's not what he meant he was just saying bah bah bah blah etc etc well anyway that's just the first example off the top of my head but I think that everybody has had one of these experiences at one time or another and I know I have and looking back that comprised some of the most embarrassing read in the face moments of my life and why are these things so embarrassing when you misunderstand some why is that so embarrassing well when you misunderstand what someone says as a personal attack it actually serves to highlight boldface and underline their insecurities for everyone else around in other words if you haven't said anything nobody would have thought twice when something like this happens it's often the result of something that we call filters of insecurity and everyone has these to one degree or another they're like these tinted glasses and set our heads that color everything we perceive so let me give you another example let's say that a person of high self-esteem and a person of low self-esteem are given the same compliment right say so much less with a nice jacket that's cool now the person that has high self-esteem is likely to graciously accept the compliment and move on cool on the other hand the person with low self-esteem might interpret the remark as being sarcastic or possibly condescending due to his internal filters main security about his appearance and these filters actually changed the way that he hears things and they transformed this innocent compliment into a snide dig about his lame-ass jacket you see the difference so now let's imagine that the same two people are on the receiving end of an insult all right hey man like your hair looks you got electrocuted right the guy with low self-esteem would be crushed his internal state will be broken he may even respond with a choice insult or two of his own men perhaps some sort of expletive all right the guy with high self esteem however might interpret it as a joke like hahaha yeah cool man yeah thanks electrocuted awesome right so see he not only is he free of filters of insecurity but he actually has filters of confidence which proactively defend him against attacks like this and the point is this because the high self-esteem guy interpreted the insult as a joke it becomes a joke not only to him but to everyone else around him and it's the same with the low self-esteem guy's reaction to the compliment the interpretation becomes the meaning for all intents and purposes perception is reality alright so this is related to a concept that we talked about before and of course that is the concept of frame control and your frame well that's the way you perceive things to be in any given situation and in any social interaction of course the strongest frame wins and other people are going to be sucked into it right so think how you would behave if a cop came up to you got his hand on his gun and he starts asking you a bunch of questions and you would probably choose your words pretty carefully might adjust your posture to seem like non threatening refer to him to sir right or officer you might not be able to hold eye contact as long as you would with some random Joe all right so now conversely imagine if a 10 year old started coming up and came with you rather and started asking you the same questions it's unlikely you would even give much thought to how you responded it's even less likely that you have difficulty keeping eye contact all right so for a person of high status they view the entire world the same way that you would do the 10 year old so you see tolerance the social pressure is a conveyor of status right demonstrating status and value is one of the most important crucial aspects of running game so your inner game affects your ability to withstand social pressure and like it or not your inner game is going to manifest itself through your body language your voice your eye contact and countless other cues and this is why it's so important to pinpoint your filters of insecurity and do whatever is necessary to eradicate them so with that in mind I'm going to list some of the most common filters of insecurity for you here and let's go number one is being stuck in your head you'll see this one a lot have you ever been talking to someone it seems like they're not really listening to you but they're actually somewhere else well what they're doing is probably this they're they're not paying attention to other people because you're their focus on their next move or thinking about logistics or something like that so when you do this you're not present you're not living in the moment and it can end up hurting you right a social interaction is a living dynamic thing and to avoid making social errors you need to pay attention to the people you're interacting with so get out of your own head number two nervousness with this one the fear of failure colors everything around you so think about how this could sabotage your game a person of true high status wouldn't view social interaction think having potentially negative consequences so if you're portraying yourself as someone of high status but underneath you're nervous it's going to show so you got to shake that nervousness remember it's called the game for a reason it's not called the work number three paranoia so this is another big one this is what was going on in the example above with the short fellow and it's this one is particularly insidious let's say you're gaming a girl and you hear someone laughing behind you and you instantly assume that they're laughing at you so your state brakes right turns out they were just laughing at some joke that their friend hold right but that's irrelevant the damage is already done and so are you so remember just because you're paranoid it doesn't mean that they're not out to get you but if your behave as though it does anyway number four are self-monitoring this is related number one but it's worse in a certain sense it's actually kind of like one and two combined actually so if you're constantly analyzing the reaction to everything you say to make sure that it's well-received you're walking on eggshells you're carefully selecting the words that are coming out of your mouth basically you're being what we call outcome dependence which reeks of neediness so live in the moment let go of any concerns we have about the outcome number five undeserving this I used to be massively guilty of this one I mean it's also called a lack of entitlement you know I would approach beautiful girls and then inexplicably I'd screw it up and I couldn't understand why for the longest time because when I'd go up to regular average girls I'd have no problem when picture perfect game I knew exactly what to do and I would execute it but for some reason when I hit up a hot-ass girl it was like I forgot all those lessons and I suddenly started acting like an idiot I realized that this was related to filters of insecurities I felt that I didn't deserve them okay because I wasn't worthwhile enough myself and I wasn't until I understood this and rejected that idea that I started having success with these women and you should do the same number six fear of expression you ever had stage fright that's what this is make no mistake when you're running game on a girl it's no different than getting up on a stage and say singing in front of a crowd all right it's all about expression the game is an expression of your internal state conveyed by the rhythms that you use to direct the energy of the interaction so if you want to have success in pickup you've got to be unafraid to get out there and shine all right that's what charisma is all about and people are drawn to it like a magnet number seven arrogant believes someone with arrogant beliefs they refuse to acknowledge that they can learn anything from someone else and this can end up hindering your development as a pickup artist because oftentimes the biggest revelations can come from unlikely sources for example believe it or not every single time I do a boot camp I end up learning something from the student that I will incorporate into my game oftentimes it's something about what not to do but that's neither here nor there the point is always keep the student frame number eight changing self-esteem on what others think if you have this particular filter in your head your state is easily broken as soon as anyone launches an attack on so unfortunately this betrays you as someone with a weak frame who is not of high status and sinks your game so always keep in mind your success or failure at this game has nothing to do your value as a human being any more than your ability to shoot at basketball does it's just a skill number nine fear to break rapport now many students I work with are plagued by this because they're they're afraid to be perceived as rude you know they weren't raised that way they don't want to seem rude and what they don't realize is that in many situations break in rapport is in fact the correct course of action for example when somebody tries to tool you or possibly in the initial stages of the pickup in order to build attraction with the girl but these guys are so paralyzed by the idea that they might be thought of as rude they fail to act and they watch the whole house of cards come tumbling down so don't be a doormat stand up and be counted break rapport when it's necessary number 10 need to entertain this is also known as the curse of the dancing monkey right this is this feeling that you have to constantly impress others lest they grow bored and run away from you okay basically this is indicative of a lack of confidence you don't feel intrinsically valuable so you bust out all these old jokes and gimmicks and an attempt to hold the attention of the group are you sure you're you might hold their attention but all you're really doing is providing them with their entertainment for the night and when closing time comes around it's going to be thank you very much nice to meet you pat pat pat and you're going home alone so lose this need to entertain you want to drop it like a hot rock so these filters have insecurities that I've listed here are just a sample of the more common ones that we see in the field and this list is by no means intended to be some kind of comprehensive catalog so take the time and ask yourself which of these could potentially apply to me and then do your best to eliminate them from the life confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion and freesia and freesia,GH0_8HqyH7g
welcome I'm a cop from the future sent back in time to kill Hitler so happy Halloween so welcome good to see you want to get that little hot I think I turned on me so got him a little hot so yeah Toronto one of my favorite cities in North America here for two things aside from the killing of Hitler I'm here for poutine and team poon so you don't really encounter teenagers in the bar in America because the drinking age is 21 so so yeah so looking forward to that hopefully and cross your fingers you know do what you can so who's got a question they'd like address being mysterious is good but what you revealing too much hmm if it's bragging it was like qualifying yourself I think that's that's the distinction I mean being mysterious wait what does that mean even like you're like wow like I mean like I mean what am i what do you mean by be mysterious you're not revealing too much but you were it's still kind of like there's a defender that she wants yeah and there's one thing too if the girl asked me a straight-up question I'm gonna tell her the truth right I know a lot of guys they love to lie you know Julian for example like my son I killed him is Gasper or whatever the fuck like I'm a racist alcoholic that works at a wax museum and fucking hates black people like like dude he'll like say all this crazy shit like just to see if the girl will stay there and a lot of times they do is like I can't believe that I'm saying this shit like and they're staying here you know like you know I don't I'm personally on many things but a liar is not one of them but there is a distinction however between a joke and a lie you know what I mean like so if I say to the girl I'm I'm a cop from the future that was sent here to kill Hitler like that's a joke that's not a lie right so you know I like to keep it fun I think it's a bottom line but if she asked me like a point-blank question about my shit I'm probably gonna I'm going to come out like I don't want to be I don't want to seem like you're hiding something yeah so that's the thing miss mystery is good seeming like you're hiding something maybe not so much yeah what are your thoughts on the lone wolf and in comparison to instead of just going out with it with a wing like the benefit you're on your investment get a feel so uncomfortable just you what are your thoughts I actually love it um not all the time but I think going out by yourself I think it's good for the soul I think it builds character it's not something you want to do all the time because you know logistical obstacles are going to you know be your your downfall in that scenario usually but I think it's like if you do that it really builds like a confidence I'll be like dude I could do anything motherfucker you could drop me in like a strange place where I don't know anyone and I could go around and I could fucking make friends I could have a social circle up and running in a week you know a rudimentary one at least yeah so I think that I think it's real good actually I think it's going to do it from time to time I'm never back in the day a lot of times I would just go out with my showed roommates who would like kind of laugh at me and stuff at least I had someone like kind of go back to when I got to blow out yo my hair but you know at least like recharge my emotional batteries and then go out and you know approach more but even a lot of times they wouldn't go out I'd be like yo let's go out like now and that well Jeff he's rolling solo tonight and it'll be the first time in gonna be the last boom and I'd let's walk out the door and see what happens as I treat the night as an adventure so let's just you then and you know you come out of interaction you make sure that you're always moving to the next right you kind of got to yeah you talk to guys no you just talk to girls yeah I talk to everyone especially in that scenario how's that goes I did a bit you know just chop it up and the thing is all talked to all kinds of people in the club you know I just don't want to be especially your solo the thing is because remember there's an inertia to taking action and then there's an inertia to in action as well I always like to say the club's like uh you want thinking like a wave when you first go in it's like the wave begins swelling up behind you especially the beginning of the night as it begins populating yeah it's a now if you want to catch that wave what do you got to do see they'll start taking action paddling and if you don't and you just kind of sit there and her needed you to do what's going to happen now it's on top of you and now you're getting kind of knocked around underneath your again now you're at the effect then the things the environment whereas if you UK action early you cross well that you know Tyler you spell the indifference threshold where you're now indifferent to approaching although I prefer to call it the enthusiasm threshold right I think that's that's more accurate even like it's not like I'm indifferent to whether or not I get blown out no it's more like I do a couple of approaches and I'm like who can I slept with next hey I'm like like this little gremlin run around like causing problems that's a big thing - this is fucking huge tape write this shit down if you're writing down a lot of guys and this is the big problem I see with students that are like just learning this stuff they're going in there just trying to make it a nice time you know what I mean like I just hope it's a nice time and nothing bad happens like and they'll all see these guys talking and they're just like nice time nice time nice time and then all roll up and I'm like what's up house oh you go shopping a little lunch time yeah nice time okay I'm here to ruin shit like I'm here to ruin shit that's my fucking mentality I'm here to ruin shit like not really like you know ruin I think like ruin your lives but like you know I'm here shake things up alright whether this my next thing then yeah so you have no issues then going in on a job to roll one got one one row one guy whatever you're building a nurse why wouldn't you go in on those Watson you know they're already interacting right so it's kind of a sticky situation but you just come so you're so you wouldn't go into didn't want to interrupt their conversation I guess that's a big thing to so when you go up are they going to be annoyed that you're interrupting them probably yeah you are if you are fucking interrupting them you are the key though you've got to do yourself is more valuable than the interruption right you'll the old saying that we say is like imagine you had a check for a million dollars with her name on it if you go home you're like hey excuse me yeah actually I think what the fuck is this but she's going to change her tune rather quickly once you produce the fucking check so you are the so called going to go check for a million dollars now you're always going to get that look and you're going to get that look like you know when you walk up you're like excuse me and they're like like who the fuck is oh great another one you know the thing is I understand it's an autopilot reaction man if you don't get that look I'm like what's going on what's wrong are they high like huh you know I mean I've got to worry if I don't get the fucking look but again it's an autopilot response because why - pepper sensing with 13 I got their little fucking boobs they had creepers fucking coming up - on the subway trying to rub on on the shit fucking co-workers making inappropriate comments etc etc and it's just like dude just fucking socks you know so so again I don't take it personally and the thing is - like oh there's a guy there whether the hole is the boyfriend herder right like the man you don't know who the fuck it is it could be a co-worker it could be their little brother it could be the fucking some random dude that just came up it could be a number of things the friends don't speculate find out and I'm not there to ruin relationships or some shit after like oh it's my boyfriend and so it's like the genuine boyfriend and I could tell she's like telling you yeah that's my fucking boyfriend like oh cool well anyway guys building like bullshit around for like two more sentences and like a cool guys well how cool not good to meet you BAM I'll fuck off and then I go around later and maybe I see those people when I'm with a girl and they're like hey man what's up and now there's social proofing me cuz I didn't act like a fucking dickhead you know I mean I was there cause like ruin like I'm there to ruin shit and the sense in there to shake things up you know I'm there to express myself and see if they're down with it you know and I understand Jeffy is for some not for others you know I fully understand that so I don't see rejection I'm look I see lack of chemistry right that's literally what we see now yeah what did you do when we are arguing for your age because sometimes I am saying forty like I feel like I don't want to lie but I don't want to say that true because there's a big gap so there's a big gap why pussy right wait so I'm but dude the thing is again in the hot seat literally half the girls in the fucking hot seat I go government that you see are like literally half my age okay I used to think this shit to game Trump's all man if you're cool and you're not like you're not acting like some fucking old loser it's not gonna be a big deal now am I gonna get priced out like some absolutely who gives a shit it's not like every time you do an approach a petal falls off the rose your hit points go down okay there's literally no consequence there's literally no consequence to getting a rejection in the club there's none zero I don't give a okay this person's opinion of me is I don't give a shit like it makes no quantifiable difference in my day-to-day existence clubs in Toronto especially you student are pretty expensive you have any free products I can have I  would say uh I would say don't don't drink but if you really would like a drink I got a drink for you right here here's your drink here's your free drink makes sense like what the fuck yeah oh so what would you do if you like hockey practice you buddy turns out blue person you try to aggressive yeah like I know you're too aggressive no yeah like you just keep getting worse let them watch then okay well number one thing your father's discuss anyway from me hey fifteen feet I can't hear your fucking saying so that's a big problem right there like if I can't even hear what you're fucking saying fifty feet away from me that's a huge fucking problem so again stand up and ask me again projector voice so like a ladder so like I just I would know everyday uh like like first wind wall but then it turns out like at some point I realized hey things are progressing like just keep getting worse okay so thanks so the thing is by the way not to not to be too much a dick but you're out like your voice like very wavering when you did that and maybe because you're put on the spot here but the thing is when you're going up to girls you're going to be on the fucking spot so that's how you're talking when you're approaching girls in the club no wonder you're fucking not having good result okay you need to be go up and you need to go big not like some crazy fucking maniac  you know that's a lot of a thing but at least you have a you know assertive you know I mean like hey good evening how's it going yes pleased to meet you on the next 88 of the night huh all right again so you gotta learn to that no I struggle with that as well and how I got through that is I I put myself in scenarios that first me to be the center of attention like public speaking like dude this shit would fucking scare the shit out of me 10 years ago right and to be honest even like wells about to come in here and I've done some hundreds of times well I add too much caffeine that's probably why but I was a little like a little bit so there's a little bit right I like that now I like that shit now you know I mean it's like it's time bitch like I fucking enjoy it so you know public speaking um karaoke was a big one for me put myself on stage anything where people are fucking looking at you he's going to help with that okay um improv comedy class stand-up comedy class things of that nature so that's number one now the question as to why you may be going out and still not getting better or even possibly getting worse a lot of times when you're trying to adopt unfamiliar behaviors it's going to be a two steps forward one step back thing because let's say that you go out and now you're trying to do physicality for example like before you could have talked to the girl and it would have gone fine you could just talk to her and pull her and it would have been fine but now you're trying to do these weird fucking physical moves and you're not comfortable with it you haven't done it a lot you're doing a ham-fisted and weird and she fucks off you're like god dammit if I just sat there and acted normal I probably would have a better chance but the thing is once you learn it then it comes back like a tsunami and that's when we make the one step for or the two subs for rather so there's that so understand that again there's a lot of parallel focuses to game you can't learn them all at once so you have to accept that a lot of times it's going to be like that secondly don't look at the hills and valleys try to see the big picture I know it's hard to say especially you only been doing it a short time but again back if you were to look at my like if you were to zoom in on like a graph of my like skill level over the years you would see like periods of like several months so I didn't get laid then I fucking sucked then you see other times where am i killing it and then they saw the hills and valleys however if you were to back off and look at the big picture you know it would look more like a fucking like like a J curve right you know like you would see the gradual like in cruising boom so you want to try to look at a big picture and then secondly and then third rather be make sure they're being intelligent about the growth and be honest with yourself about we were fucking up and this is where your wings can come in you know ask your wings danaiah what am i doing what could I do different you know and wings we used to tell me for example Christophe one time he's like man he's like you just go in there and you just talk and you don't fuckin escalate and the girl likes it she laughs and she ever you're not fuckin taken to that level why because I was afraid like it's going good if I try to escalate much stop going good I was afraid of ground zero right cuz when you first go out you're like you find the girl getting in the night or you know you go through a bunch of girls that take you six girl before you find them that's like gets a good reaction and then what well now you want to stay has now if I if this one doesn't work now going to maybe cut to five more and I'll be back to Ground Zero thing is you have a fucking low ground team that's your fucking home you embrace ground zero motherfucker [Music],GO185f3dpO8
good morning it is I your proverbial boy Jeffy back once again and today I want to talk about a very important topic and it's how your posts on social media might be killing you now that sounds a little melodramatic but recently I read an article in Scientific American fabulous publication if you're interested in science and their offshoot Scientific American mind which teaches a lot of great stuff about psychology and again the inner workings of the human mind it's one of the few publications I actually subscribe to but in any case in this article we talked about a project that Google rolled out in 2010 and what this project did it actually analyzed search queries in an attempt to track the spread of influenza of the flu and anyway so that was the initial purpose of the program but then they decided to take it further okay so what they did they began to develop an algorithm that could actually predict happiness and well-being by tracking the language that people used on social media and they called this the the world wellbeing project now by 2015 they had with this project evaluated over a hundred million tweets from all over the United States so here's where it gets crazy they actually discovered that negative tweets in particular tweets that were expressing anger or hostility these reliably predicted rates of death from heart disease in a given location and beyond that they also just discovered strong links between the language that was used in social media posts and both mental as well as physical illnesses excuse me so look we know there's been decades of research now indicating that the words that we use in everyday conversation can actually tell someone a lot about our underlying psychology and furthermore we also know I mean this is fact there there are many very real links between a person's mental state and their actual physical well-being right so stress negativity anxiety depression these things can all have a significant and very real impact in pairing our immune systems and impairing our cardiovascular systems and of course conversely positive emotions optimism these things have a beneficial effect reducing the risk of many diseases and in fact even increasing life expectancy so these days you know 2016 social media has obviously become incredibly pervasive now this happened over the last ten years and as a result the amount of data that's actually available for studies of this nature has grown exponentially now it is true that we do present a skewed image of ourselves online you know you want to make your life appear awesome and happy and you're such a happy person so people think you're cool that is true however these biases aren't necessarily as distorting as one might think because since basically everybody does it the algorithms can actually correct for this bias so furthermore there's been like a lot of breakthroughs in natural language processing over the last thirty years there's also been like as we all know massive advances of computing power it's now as a result of these things become feasible to process language using statistical pattern recognition and in recent years these tools have advanced very dramatically and you know we see that in things like you know the Siri app on your phone your iPhone things like Google Analytics which is responsible for very highly targeted ads that you see come up on the sidebar your email and things of that nature and in one study these machine learning algorithms were applied to a large set of Facebook posts with the end goal of predicting users personalities using only their their feeds and as it turned out these algorithms scored higher than actual friends who filled out personality surveys about the subjects in other words the algorithm knew these people better than their own friends did a little spooky but you know it is what it is so they then use this same process to create psychological profiles for over 1300 United States counties alright and here's where shit gets interesting the counties that had more negative low vibration tweets so to speak that is once again expressing anger hostility employing words such as hate haters curse words these counties actually had the highest rates of death from heart disease according to the CDC and optimistic counties on the other hand had you know much lower mortality rates from these diseases and in particular this method was accurate at detecting atherosclerosis which is the kind of cardiac disease most associated with psychological causes it is interesting to note here that the people doing the actual tweeting of the negative messages weren't necessarily the ones actually dying so you know it wasn't something like 17 year old tweeting I fuck the haters who's dying of heart disease but rather the overall tenor of the tweet sort of gave a snapshot of the psyche of the particular community as a whole and sociologists will often talk about a concept called social cohesion or the willingness of community members to you know support and help each other and it's basically thought that the greater social cohesion in the community the more healthy its individual members are going to be but anyway that aside the predictions made with this algorithm turn out to be more accurate than any predictions that were made using actual government statistics for like the known risk factors you know including obesity smoking and so on and so forth in fact the the language variable is accurately predicted the rates of heart disease even after they controlled for you know very strong classical predictors such as education poverty and so forth so in the future this technology might actually be used to help physicians treat individual patient patients recently at the University of Pennsylvania they had a kind of a trial program where they had iPads in the ER and they asked incoming patients to like voluntarily sign under their Facebook accounts and then give the app permission for their status updates to be analyzed so the the machine learning algorithm was of course then used to correlate their language patterns with their medical records and the resulting data led to the discovery of various language markers for various diseases including depression other mental diseases and things like that so given that it's pretty easy to imagine like you know kind of a future app that would analyze your posts and if necessary alert your doctor who would then send you you know a text with like an important insight or a reminder to take your pills or you know recommendation that or something of that nature of course if you want to be a little more pessimistic you can imagine insurance companies abusing the shit out of this technology but you know it's up to us what we do with it right but the bottom line here is this okay what's the point language is very very powerful and of course you know I've known that for years and anyone who's you know we know that it shapes her internal processes it shapes your internal life you know Tony Robbins he actually said years ago that the words we habitually choose affect how we communicate with ourselves and therefore what we actually experience on a day-to-day basis so it's very very important that we curate the language we use our self-talk in order to ensure that our lives move in a more positive direction so these types of studies not only confirm that but furthermore they suggest that the effect might even be more powerful than previously believed it might in fact be a matter of life and death anyway this is Jeff e signing out and I'll see you next time on my awesome channel I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that completely automates the process to get me dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do this is execute the program version 2.0 the ruthlessly efficient highly repeatable system for the modern day online gangster it's over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of aim filled footage welcome down case network and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you pull her that night I covered the exact repeatable pattern takes to take a girl home nearly 85% of the time she agrees to meet up with me this is my online masterpiece at bottom line - just plain works now you have a choice to make keep using the Internet to beat off or use it to have someone else beat it off for you so decide how fast you want to start getting laid and execute the program [Music],H0W1LKQPS2s

in New York we get the unique opportunity to the world walking on the street and there you go bro if my daughter was out walking the street I say do not talk to strangers in my girls l I'd say anyone talks to you keep walking because they're your property  [Applause]  anyway sorry I'm funny if you get 5 to 10 seconds to make an impression what some turbocharged material big if the date home I'll be like I'll literally probably suck ask directions or something like that just it in order to get them to stop fucking talking so keep fucking talking especially if you're trying to stop like moving set moving people look damn that I get really deep into this become the hot side you'll see like various examples of this like stopping movie sets and stuff like that but there's two approaches now and this this applies to the club as well if your girls are walking through the club a lot of times you'll see that the guy will try to do like what we call the heart stop but they're like hey like they'll say something now some girls will like this oh confident those who wants taking charge like etc ok I'll stop and speak to this person you know as long as he looks in the eyes and it's not this half-assed date other people will never stop for that shit ok nope I just continue walking the biggest thing that I see guys do is like they give up and that happens they go what I guess it didn't work and he just kind of like oh it's done so you want to have the ability to switch through what we call the slow roll so essentially what this means you continue view you just walk with them and you a little bit in front I never want to be behind ever I don't want to approach from behind I want to be speaking and someone from behind it's just fucking creepy it's just like what the hell is this person doing like it's just you know essentially this animal that's like stalking me from behind so I'm on like maybe a half step ahead and like the kids remember it's it's generally the vibe not the content that people are attracted to so if you're coming out of like yours a cool friendly cool person that just talks to people as opposed to a weirdo doing weird shit then you're gonna have a better chance of stopping now ideally if you're going you want to play build up enough social capital that then you eventually get them to stop now how do you know when you've achieved enough social capital that they might stop well when you can attempt to stop okay so how do you know this is the same question as how do you know when you've cooked cooked and interaction so when you look at interaction they'll go from making non-committal monosyllabic responses to responding to what you're saying maybe asking you questions their body languages are totally open up they'll be smiling they'll be happy so if you're walking with them and there's like nope yes nope nope I don't know derp and they're like very closed off again after like a certain amount of time of this maybe like a minute I was gonna like okay the shit ain't working right but I'm at least gonna give it that that minute right of like hey and I'm gonna keep fucking talking I'm not gonna like put it upon them like look what the worst approach that you can do is like the especially in the details like that go into the interview mode right so you gotta like have to develop what we called million-dollar mouths these which that ability is like talk talk talk talk talk are you contributing to their experience are you itching so imagine it even from a guy's perspective imagine you're walking down the street and some dude comes up to use like hey man how's it going oh hey pretty good is that cool what's your name  where do you live what you do what's your job take the fuck are you why you ask me these fucking questions I did this fuck lately there's interview mode thing why why do guys work the interview mode it's just what they think is going to work because they think oh I get rapport with someone first right that's how it works like it makes sense I need to get a comfort with someone first and then I can try to take a romantic or ticket to you know a distraction the attraction mode but you got to ask you know why would the woman he wants get like want you to know this information about her unless she was attractive so you want to flip down on his head like again the conventional wisdom is comfort first Emma traction what do you see us go up it subtraction first it's like a traction first okay damn about your look are you involved in the fashion industry in some capacity oh yeah like I was saying / and then damn it's kind of weird questions we always Hamid you're like an herb that you became on like in high school either ugly duckling - transformed glorious Swan so what's going on here Sarah anyway anyway like I was saying I had a bomb care now you park at this trunk all the surgery I didn't even need rhinoplasty funky calf implants damn I might go saying damn girl you're like an angel good luck anyway like I was saying like so it's just like barrage like pepper dip so they know what and then the verbal statements of ten is only one thing a lot can be said with the eye contact a lot can be said with the tone of the book will turn out but they will know from the moment I go up there that I'm there like if I go home with this guy he's gonna take this dip down right  if I want to do that like there's no question if I gonna get baggy together oh my what is happening I don't know like that so generally I would say go for the you know go for the hard stop like I can get openers let something you guys openers and it comes off super weird in there it's a lot of mine are like very unusual like it's like hi good evening I invented tacos or you know some random shit I am then tacos  the main thing is go for a heart stop it doesn't work transform the slow roll keep talking hopefully you get enough social capital Dayton stop attraction for us not comfort that's kind of the broad brushstrokes glasses I get thought it was how to sexually escalate I pull a lot of ASA dates but I can't seem to escalate I properly okay I pull a lot of instance dates but I can't seem to escalate problem is what he said now so where do you so do you have like a like a specific area that you go for these these dates you need spare and so where do you take is you Oh Starbucks well known for romance Starbucks  okay so here's the if you're gonna grab my destiny like you're skipping about like 17 steps he's on the Luisi case  right - no Jack it off in front of them  now okay I see what you're saying okay I said so so my my assistant was actually here he has a hundred daygame ladies from essentially a place much like this where he hangs out the Powell Street turnaround in San Francisco he'll meet the girls again same principles are good to stop he's quite upfront about what he's there for and then what he'll do is then he'll move them to a local a nearby hotel which has like a little mezzanine area that's relatively isolated and there's like a hotel bar there's there if she wants a can you'll have a couple of drinks as well and then I think it also has like a police station or something so there's like an activity and from there he'll do like lights escalation so she understands that as a romantic encounter he's not trying to fuck in the start you sure - trying to fucking Starbucks all these are you trying to do is establish that that this is in fact a romantic encounter now again what are some simple things that I'll do when I'm on the time on the date I'll just you know interlace my hands with theirs just start holding hands like that that's pretty simple it's inoffensive and if she won't even do that if you won't even hold your fucking hand then that it's not like you fucked it up it's like you found out this person oh I know that never had any intention of fucking you right so that's that's very innocuous and then from there I might like ask them if they would accompany me to the prom if I were to ask them going aren't we a little old for that like no I meant figuratively and from there it's time for a dance so now I've been the hands now on entering personal space with a plot line to it that makes it know we're going to the prom if you go in and kiss her on the neck from there maybe Eskimo kiss into a light kiss from there hey you know what let's get out of here you know I got some drinks at my place I got the hot tub in my place whatever right and then you know you can meet the puppy you meet the kitty meet the bird meet the lizard meet the kid - listen and cut in my fucking backyard whatever it whatever you have that there whatever you have back there let's go out here blah blah blah and then and then pull from there and then obviously I do honestly he's probably to rethink this whole Starbucks thing because I mean nothing like kills of my boner and these were the Starbucks boyish here's so wait hey where are you where do you pull your romantic dates to I'm forgetting this is like a day game master you want to come up here come up here he does it is digging he just knock him to and he pretty impressive shit he is he's in the van club he's about to the van so why do you tell them real briefly like what's your mo yeah it's kind of the way it play it out okay cool so all right dig in so the main thing that you want to be railroad is that in the daytime what are people mostly doing like girls right there they're trying to go from point A to point B so they're you know going about their day trying to get stuff done the main focus that you know you need to have is always go for the poor because here's the thing there's going to be one girl who's gonna like you she's gonna be totally into you you're gonna have really good chemistry but the most important thing is that she might not have anything to do within the next three hours and like how fast can you bowl from the daytime you can pull as fast as like one hour two weeks ago in number 96 I pulled her within 40 minutes and I mean I think the fastest was 15 and it was crazy the main thing that you want to do is the the venue change so that's what actually changes the whole dynamic so if you think about it it that's what makes it switch from like a more like daytime like platonic thing to a more like intimate like romantic so here the question so he so what he does he's been pulling them to a nearby Starbuck yes and then so you so I guess he's asking like how do I make that transition you have the Starbucks over there to either the home oh okay so here's what I do is so back home there's this spot is my secret spot that actually I'm not gonna tell you where it is so just to describe it it's it's a hotel but when the first floor is a bar and on the second floor is in mezzanine and between the between 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. there's nobody there so you want to find a place like that where you can have drinks and then you can find a place where you can just isolate yeah because it sounds like this Starbucks is probably like it's like probably that's a very busy place so it's like dude everyone's like look if you're trying to escalate you have you like who's looking at this self-conscious it's awkward like so you want to find a different place that's not a popular little off the beat and the the other thing they need to pay attention to is seating the pool so from the very beginning you need to be like talking about what you need to be screening for logistics so like oh so you know you seem like way too polite to be from here like worrying from you know like oh you know from here oh great so what part of town do you live in now oh I live in the financial district oh great I live 10 minutes away so there's like the first seed to temp right so you that's when you actually start doing it so it's like oh now she knows like whoa this guy lives close by and then you know the more you you know the more you get to know the more she gets to know you you talk about like oh you know I I have a guitar at home or you know what I have this set of like wooden sake cups I've ever drank sake in the traditional Japanese way you know or I have a  I like pool play like recently - it was like yeah my Super Nintendo so I remember those things and when you finally feel the opportunity to do pool just you know I would usually say oh you know what drinks here are like really expensive we should go drink saké at my house I'll teach you how to play guitar and perhaps show you the market part yeah the thing is it's like this so-called reason for the pulp it dude honestly it really doesn't matter does the chick doesn't like you it doesn't want to go with you she's not gonna go regardless it doesn't matter it doesn't even give you that elaborate it just needs to be something a little it needs to be something slightly more diplomatic than hey do you want to go to my house to fuck and help that would probably work sometimes especially if it's like her she's a little bit older she's you know comfortable with that you're gonna textual allegorically yeah oh so fuck you know but again make it a little bit more diplomatic a there's a hot tub hey there's this there's actually the plate Oh check it out if she wants to go he's good to go kids want to go there's nothing in the world was gonna fucking paper code so we created the hot seat because we didn't want to do just seminar about these concepts they wanted to show you full pickups from open to closed on video you can see exactly what to do we're Mike dumb you're right they're super gangster right up in it it's a very set curriculum designed to give you specific epiphanies laid out step by step the answer to every situation furthermore I do a lot of live commentary I stop the video to show you little things you wouldn't notice then we do exercises live to catalyze transformation we developed a program that not only caters to you if you want to pick up but to build social skills and crazy momentum in life we also give you a very nice bonus package consisting of the 9-ball audiobook one year pass to all Jiffy Pop C's access to the jet the hot seat number two Facebook naturally and a limited edition pander t-shirt beyond that we're offering a 100% money-back guarantee if you want to learn the game this is the easiest fastest way to do  sufficient features and features and features and three students educational features of the agency shouldn't we shouldn't region and freesia and redundancy shouldn't create inflation inflation  you,HLe88UHn4Yw
know what up it's the proverbial boy here and today I'm going to talk about what it needs to be smooth and how to cultivate that quality in your interactions so maybe you got some kickass stories some routines some fly moves some spin moves some tricks in your toolbox you know you've learned a few tactics from videos perhaps just like this one and you've been hitting the club to try them out but are you getting results  over the last 16 years I've been teaching this stuff live in the trenches in the mud so in that time I've learned a thing or two about how to impart this quality of smoothness to my clients and out there in the field is where the rubber meets the road so to speak and what I really love about this job and about that fact is that all the rationalizations all the coulda woulda shoulda become meaningless in the field so the stuff that does not work has the tendency to get filtered out very very quickly and what that means that here on my channel I'm bringing the time-tested truth so if that's what you came for take a moment like and subscribe you can get these tips every week now what differentiates a guy who's naturally attractive to women from a guy who's a routine spinner quote-unquote is that magic glue that holds an interaction together and the glue that makes it all flow and blend together seamlessly and congruently its smoothness okay and that glue the bits in between are different for every person like just look at all the coaches in RSD we've all got different characters we've got different styles different hobbies and we could all tell the same story and it'll sound completely different depending on who's actually telling it now personally I view my social conversational mind as one of those magic 8-balls and if you know what a magic 8-ball is it's this toy of an oversized billiards 8-ball and you shake it and your fortune floats up to the surface right so I have all of this info and all these tools floating beneath the surface in my subconscious mind they're all there they're all bubbling below the surface and they are ready to be unleashed like the Kraken behind me in this bay here so so when I go into an interaction I literally have one thing in my mind as I walk up hey right hey that's it and like shaking my magic calibrating an eight ball a conversational piece then floats to the surface and then the fun begins so this cell reference points work so the more field experience and reference points that you have the more efficient your 8-ball becomes so to explain this a bit more you should think of the ability to be witty on the fly as a coin with two sides and the first side of the coin is learning what we call the invisible threads of conversation now what are invisible threads is the concept that we've talked a lot about an RSD before you may have heard it but just to reiterate invisible threads is the idea that in a given interaction in a given conversation there's an infinite number of things that a person could say however as you go out more and more you learn that within that infinity there's a finite range of things that they usually do say so if you go out a lot you'll hear you know I'll say if I say this line they could say an infinite number of things in response but they will usually say this this this this or this like there's five typical responses and as you go out you hear these more and more and so you cultivate Twp responses to those replies and you might have like if I say this they could say these five things if they say this I have four pre-fabricated responses each one in parting a different emotional tenor to the interaction depending on which way I want to take it so basically it becomes like this sort of dialogue tree in a video game now obviously that's an oversimplification but it's a good analogy so over time the net effect of this is you appear to always have a better answer right so that's the concept of invisible threads and that's one half one side of the witticisms coin now on the other side of the coin you've got this idea of letting go okay so on the one side of the coin you got learning the threads on the other side it's not an adding and that's kind of an adding on of material on the other side of the coin it's a letting go of needing the material to be good of needing it to work so a filtering so at the hot seat at the transformational exercises part at the end change work exercise depart we do at the end of our hot seats will often do an exercise where we have guys come up and just free they clear their mind make it completely blank and whatever words float to the surface you're just gonna say it and so let me do that right now I can do it pretty much endlessly so if I clear my mind hot dogs incandescent violence tangential idiosyncratic pineapple licorice tangerine hippopotamus President Barack Obama etc etc I can just I can just say these words endlessly and whatever bubbles up I just say and I could literally probably stand here for a 10-hour video maybe that should be another video right it's a stand to do that for 10 hours straight all right that would be a great one but anyway I don't know who'd watch it but it'd be pretty cool so anyway a lot of times we do when we do that hot seat exercise it comes to a certain guys turn and he just cannot do it he's sitting there he's like cat his floor like he loved here's the floor I'll say floor and he just can't do it and know what's going on there what's the mechanism that's happening there is the guy he is filtering too much he needs it to be cool he's ashamed or possibly like concerned like what if I say something that's embarrassing or reveal something embarrassing about how my psyche works so he's filtering too much and he simply cannot do it this is something that you want to really get away from and you just want to have this ability to completely let go so I can free flow I got bars right but beyond this I'm always hyper aware of the energy levels the comfort levels all the little sub communications of the people that I'm interacting with I'm aware of even the slightest shifts in these in the energy and these emotional shifts I calibrate accordingly this is what smooth is we all know the concept of change their mood not their mind so you glide up to them smooth strong frame like nothing they say or do is gonna make any quantifiable difference whatsoever you never miss a beat now initially they might be skeptical yet something keeps them there something keeps them intrigued and eventually they feel different they feel happier and it's you that's done this you have high value this is the addiction that is social interaction so now let's apply this to you all right I teach this to my students often this guy one versus guy two mentality so guy number one you're out there she is she's at the bar we all have this image of the perfect girl and that's her she's standing there and ordering a drink so your mind starts to race you sit there and it builds up inside of you and literally one second you get that feeling in your stomach that ached it says I cannot do this but there's more maybe she's there with a group of people there are some guys some girls mixed set you know you feel it even more becomes more apprehensive your mind begins the rationalizations that's the next step right well she's probably uptight I bet she has I bet that's her boyfriend standing next to her I've never had a girl that attractive if I go up people will look at me and judge me what if she rejects me I'm not good-looking enough for her etc etc etc and basically it's over before it even started she gets her drink finishes the transaction she walks right by you you're frozen and you're done all bets are off so how many times this actually happen to you out in the field now let's take a look at the second guy guy number two so you're out there she is at the bar ordering a drink we all have the image of that perfect girl this is her but this time your mind quiets down you smile to yourself as you have many times before finally somebody worthy of your approach and you are on it your mind is silent as you glide up smooth as silk to meet her you're going to engage her you literally feel this glow of power this Nimbus if you will inside of you as you move with purpose through the crowd you are the Jedi of the nightclub she feels your presence as you come up she turns that little smirks now on your face you look her right in the eye without saying a word she's already looking you up and down like okay now everything's slow-motion you've seen it all before that magic 8-ball it shakes and the game begins she snaps to attention she looks at you as you deliver the opening line she cannot hear the music she can't see anything but you she's being immersed in emotion she's totally in the moment and now the magic 8-ball before you even consciously think the best thing to say floats right up to the surface of your mind and it rolls off your lips smooth as silk you feel that power inside you grow more and more as your words are hitting now wasn't what you actually said or was it how you said it doesn't matter because all you know is now she's all over you so what's your choice guy number one or guy number two always ask yourself am i guy one or guy two right now what would mr. smooth do now in order to get there if you're not there already number one you want to start to consciously cultivate that smooth character you know what smooth is you know what it looks like you know what it feels like when you're in that zone so start consciously doing it damn it make an effort to emulate and embody those characteristics in your speech and mannerisms in other words fake it till you make it number two start looking how you're at how your interactions are flowing right do they seem effortless to a third party observer or does it look jerky linear or mechanical right use your own magic 8-ball number three understand that that guy too smoothness so to speak is something that you are not something you do take a look at the smoothest characters in real life that you know like how are these guys conversing how are they chatting to people find like smoothness Mentors so to speak that you can model and last but at least make yourself personable and unique like for example I love the English language so my vocabulary is peppered with a lot of you know unusual words that others might not employ so know your communication style and amplify it and be mindful of that smooth flow the whole time so anyway I want to get out of this rain so that's enough lessons for today I hope this makes some sort of sense this attribute of smoothness is simply one facet of what it means to be charismatic and if you're able to internalize that personality trait the whole world just opens up for you you know business social romance everything which is why I've been developing a broad-spectrum workshop that's devoted to bringing charisma out in regular people just like yourself so you can check out charisma mastery calm right now to sign up for the VIP interest list so click the link in the description keep yourself notified about that this is Jeff getting out of the rain and I'll see you next time  [Music],HfBymjpFdWw
what up it's your boy or should I say your grown ass old man Jeffy and today I want to take a moment to talk about now before we dive in let me remind you to LIKE and subscribe to get this hot content right off the griddle every Tuesday so boom smash them buttons down below so anyway back to the topic at hand if you think about it pick up is a pretty simple thing in fact it could be considered the simplest thing in the world okay we just make it complicated now like I've said before with this stuff we can make it complicated we can make it very complicated or we can try to make it as simple as possible so take for example the animal kingdom right they have no opening lines they got no fancy routines no elaborate shifts between phases or whatever when mating season is on it's on especially so for the so called alpha males but of course that's a whole nother topic now a lot of guys come on my bootcamp and they have this hunger for more all right they want more material more lines more routines more tactics and I will give it to him you know he'll I'll give him the entire you know toolbox the whole RSD tactical manuals so to speak and at this point we got more material we got more tactics than anyone could ever use ok we figured the tactics out and yes lines and tactics are powerful however if you ask me the material is really just there as an example okay it's not a script there is a more powerful way and searching for more simply 8 where it's at in my experience where your boot camps every weekend for the past 16 years most if not all guys need less in fact which is to say I think you're already great at pick up in other words I think you already have these skills bred into your very genes going back every single generation that needed to actually mate in order for you to be here today so why are you watching this well because somewhere along the way like most of us you probably picked up some bad habits you acquired some funny ideas okay and you started viewing reality sort of distorted all sorts of fears all sorts of desires social pressures social conditioning etc so my job as I see it is not to get you to emulate me and my style heaven forbid make it make another Jeffie lord knows we only got enough of that in the world already but to unearth if you will the unique rst instructor I guess that's buried within each unique student so instead of focusing on more stuff to memorize it's about experiencing the freedom and the confidence to actually shed to those fears that you picked up along the way to kind of pare down the the the eat pare down the ego and the rolls you've been playing your entire life until you're actually more you so to speak that you have ever been before okay how's that well if you want to be a naturally attractive man it all starts with being in the moment and by that what do I mean I mean most guys before they even attempt to speak to a woman or for slightly more advanced guys before they start like escalating romantic to a romantic level escalating physically on the girl most guys if at all before they do that they start to flood their mind with all sorts of garbage okay all sorts of past fears past failures or projected future fears and failures speculation okay what should they say you know different roles to assume affirmations to themselves to psych themselves up okay when in reality the best thing that you could do is just to go talk to the woman without delay okay and I'll say that again the best thing that you can do in that moment when you see the girl is just go talk to her without hesitation you see you go you make your feet move and you'll figure it out when you get there okay so this is a huge topic and I could obviously elaborate on it for hours but for now let's just say that when you delay three things happen first and this is a big one women are acutely aware of that guy who's hovering nearby trying to build up the courage to talk to her okay you think that they don't notice they see that they notice it on their peripheral vision okay or for example the guy who can open but is too scared to escalate she sees the fear she sees the hesitation in your eyes she feels it coming from your body language and this is not gonna help you get laid okay secondly yeah when you delay you know you're trying to psych yourself up but ironically you're almost inevitably doing the exact opposite okay you're giving yourself time to think of all your insecurities all the reasons why you should not approach or not escalate and again this is not gonna get you late even if you manage to open your ability to form a genuine connection with the women that you're interacting with will be severely stunted okay if you're in your head thinking about what to say next rather than actually interacting it's it's it's not a good thing okay so keep in mind it's far better to be in the moment spontaneously generating so-called you know six out of ten material than it is to be in your head reciting ten out of ten material okay so third while you're in your head life is actually passing you by I've said this before and I'll say it again time is the only commodity that we truly have so we can only live in the present moment so you might as well you know live that moment as fully as you can so you can spend that time doing what you will a you could spend it interacting with a beautiful woman or you could spend that time in you know internal dialogue with your own fears okay trust me you're not gonna end up on your deathbed wishing you had hesitated more that's not very likely to happen so stop worrying about where you're gonna say leave that analysis for after the fact have you ever noticed that when you're you know around your close friends people you're very very comfortable with the conversation just sort of flows and you're just like riffing saying hilarious right so sure you may have more shared experiences with these people but ultimately the main reason that you have this that endless supply that limitless supply of things to say is precisely because you're not worrying about you know what you are going to say you're very relaxed the conversation is more about kind of you know sharing the good times sharing those good feelings than it is about specific content right some people myself included have called this vibing right so the next time you see an attractive woman you are going to talk to her without delay okay no agenda just just put a smile on her face make it fun that's the biggest thing just try and make it fun and a worst you might open and find you have nothing to say okay good you're still here you're still you know corporeal you're still a lie you haven't vaporized into the ether okay so now try again so you need to get comfortable with discomfort because once you've experienced discomfort on several or even many occasions you will no longer fear it and in time you're gonna discover things begin to flow right like a guy entering the gym for the first time you know you might additionally be like intimidated by all these other people who seem like they know what they're doing but you start small and eventually you're gonna build those appropriate muscles and in pick up you're gonna build the appropriate muscles for pickup as well so yes experiment with the material ok plagiarize some Jeffie lines here and there by all means you have at it okay you can have take take all my use them out there okay but certainly don't let it become your anabolic steroids okay or your crutch learn how to stand on your own two feet in the moment okay for a time you might falter okay the conversations might suck they might stall after five seconds okay great next time aim for six seconds then ten seconds okay then a minute okay then half an hour and so forth until you stop worrying about what you're gonna say and you actually start reveling in the chaos of the moment so the same goes for again like I said the next level would be from taking day not just opening but now taking things to that romantic level from the hi I'm here having an interview question take it to the romantic level so the next time you find yourself wondering whether you should actually you know drop that flirtatious comment that's statement of intent just get out of your head and do it and see what happens right because if she senses fear or hesitation your chances are reduced enormous ly right but with practice that fear will melt away you'll become shameless essentially and she'll see this in your eyes and she will love you for it so the main thing is like I said to stay out of your head because as long as you're afraid of women weather approaching them you know talking to them or you know simply worrying what they think of you at all well nothing that you are gonna think is gonna help you other than telling yourself to you know be right here right now in the moment that's the only thought that is gonna be beneficial and when you experience fear in the moment recognize it as what as a tool a tool that can be used well or not so well so you're sitting here watching this video right now take a look around you at the room maybe there's like a table okay maybe there's your phone sitting on the table maybe there's a couch and likewise maybe amongst all of these perceptions you're having about your environment maybe there is also fear and understand that it is okay right if you want to conquer fear you make friends with it when you avoid it when you flee from it or you obsess over the fear in your head you're only strengthening it so if it's there try to transcend that juvenile I like or I don't like binary and simply feel the burn if you're in the moment and let it keep burning until it has no more fuel to feed off of so you know that phone on the on the table next to you isn't going to stop you and nor should the fear okay it's just a signpost the fear points you to an area that you need to grow and presents me with an opportunity for I guess you say you know the fight or flight and it's your choice your life is not actually at risk when you're talking to a girl in the nightclub which is crazy because I've had like literal combat veterans come on my program who are afraid to approach women but the thing is it's like yeah your life is not at risk so in flight what do you stand to gain like by running from the situation you stand to gain nothing fleeing the moment it seems easy in the short term you know but it is as you've learned in the larger context it is the harder and less beneficial path in the long run in fight however and by fight I mean of course engaging with the moment at the very least we're gonna learn something that's going to bring you closer to the desired outcome and closer to a true understanding of who you are this has been Jeffy and I'll see you next time,Hg2JeAYplNM
what I'll put up it's me your boy salty cheese I'm here at the fucking dome thing and okay obviously I'm not salty Chisholm I'm Jeff and if you do have salty Chisholm this is probably something you're gonna want to take up with your local medical professional unless you're in America and which you probably don't have health insurance so you might want to like talk to your neighbor talk to a trusted friend get some pineapple juice something of that nature but in any case I'm not salty Chisholm I'm Jeff and I am here at the motherfucking dome thing and today what I wanted to talk about is venue selection when you're doing your become obsessed with going to like the best places like I want to go to the top place and you know you'll see the inner circle like what's the most exclusive place what's like the most the craziest place what place sounds like he's packed with the hottest girls now that makes sense I mean it makes logical sense if you think about it like obviously you'd want to go to the best place you possibly could with the most hot girls but sometimes this is actually counterproductive like the best the best hottest venue in town is not necessarily always the best place for pickup and I'll tell you why now before I get into that let me do a little caveat here this is not by any means intended to give you carte blanche or to you know allow you to rationalize your fear of going to a place that maybe you feel it's kind of too cool for you or or having to deal with the the hassle of getting through the door at a place that's exclusive that in and of itself is a subset of game and like I've said there's many many parallel focuses when you're trying to learn this stuff and in fact the door game if you will is one of those one of those focuses and you know when we're going to Miami for example it's loosened up there a lot more you can actually buy tickets for a lot of these places now but still I remember in years past at least like an hour the first hour of every boot camp night was often spent trying to get these students into these exclusive clubs and I remember one time in fact we're at the Fontainebleau Hotel it's myself Julian a couple of assistants and like six students I think we had nine students cuz like Owen hadn't showed up yet and so we had his students too and so it's on it's on Julian and myself to get these nine guys into this exclusive club live which at the time again you couldn't buy tickets for it you just had to kind of like there's not even a line there's just this like nebulous mass queued up around these ropes and trying to like jockey for position to the front and like these promoters would like be super callous and pretentious and just kind of like you know they select people to get in so you know it's fine if you're like some cool fucking dude who has like girls with them but you know a lot of times the client isn't necessarily someone with the best fashion sense let's just say additionally a lot of times they don't have the confidence to present themselves at the front of the line it you know at the front of the rope in a way that would either a even be able to get the promoters attention or be give off the vibe that this is somebody I want in this club so what Julian I did we basically ran around for the first hour hour and a half and we would like go up to we'd see girls and we just go up to them like this like on our phone we kind of be like oh hey is it just you two to like two girls maybe like oh yeah like okay cool do you want to get in the club right now for free like yeah I'm like okay here you go with these guys we just pulled two students over and like put them on the girls and then they go to the front and the students would get in so we did this like with all nine of these students and like I think you've got a couple of assistants and then and now it's our turn to get in and by that time there's no more girls in the lobby because we've literally used every single one of them to get the clients into the venue and so now we're like damnit what are we gonna do now right and so thank God like thank thank the Lord above basically the promoter comes out from behind the rope and it's like you two guys we're like what yeah you guys can come in cuz I guess they had liked seeing us doing this over the course of the past however they're like well they got all these girls in here we might as well let them in for free and it's funny because even though we were saying to the girls like yeah you can come in for free after they got past the rope they're like okay 40 bucks for the girls as well so anyway long story short that's like a subsection again you should actually dedicate yourself to learning because if you go anywhere cool let's say you go to Vegas and so you go to Miami so you had a Los Angeles New York City you know certain places in London it you know any place cool not certainly here in San Francisco but any place cool that's something you got you got to learn so again long caveat but the idea is not this is not to say you should shoe these venues it's just saying that when once you get into these venues they may not necessarily be the best places to do pickup so for example that place that I was just talking about live in Miami when you get in there yeah it's it's super cool it's one of the craziest clubs I've ever seen in terms of just the layout and like the the light system and the sound system but then the sound system let's talk about that for a second this is literally one of the most ear-splitting experiences I've ever had in my life outside of like like a ministry concert or something well like a Guare concert or some like extreme rock show you can't even speak to the girl so and again this does force you to have to adopt a certain very physically forward style and in order to adapt to that and and again I think that you should learn how to do that but just because you know how to do it if you're forced into that situation you know how to do it that's great it's great to have that but you shouldn't necessarily like go to that place thinking it's going to be the best because literally we're talking about an environment where if your ear or your mouth is pressed up directly to someone else's ear and you are yelling at the top of your lungs they still can understand what you're saying so there's that additionally a lot of these so-called top venues are very geared towards VIP and table service and things of that nature so for example in Las Vegas over the course of the past like three years or so maybe three to five years you've seen these clubs popping up where you can't even sit down Hakkasan for example also an example of an extremely loud club that's pretty much in tot 100% geared towards table service they have like small areas small bar areas where maybe you can do a little work there but again grant it like these so-called top tier girls that you're you're looking for in these venues guaranteed they're getting like shuttled off behind some some rope you know and you will likely not even have access to them unless a you're willing to pay or be you put in the hours and the work to cultivate the ability to get your gas past those fucking ropes and again you know this is something that you probably should learn long-term but if you don't know that don't go in there think it's gonna be like the bomb calm Luke's got a lot of material on how to actually gain access to those areas of the club but again the top place isn't necessarily gonna be the top for pickup another reason even if you do get in there it's so fuckin packed in like you're talking to the girl and you're constantly getting like elbow fucked like every three seconds like somebody's like knockin you it's like you're getting jaw sold so again not necessarily the best now this isn't to say like again caveat caveat caveat here this isn't to say that Oh instead you should go to like some shithole fucking dive bar where like old men queue up to start drinking like straight whiskey at 6:00 in the morning and there's no girls look that's the opposite end of the spectrum so you got to strike a balance right for me and I've always said this logistics is king right so you can go to a place that has the hottest girls in the world but if you if it's poor logistics from where you have to Paul that's not necessarily gonna be the best okay and in fact it could be extremely detrimental and this is a topic for a separate video that I've been telling you for quite a while sort of extolling the virtues of God Emperor logistics and well you know I've always said just in brief you know a newbie with amazing logistics will probably get laid a lot more than even at an advanced guy that has terrible logistics but again I can get into more detail in that a different video but the ideal place to pick up is probably gonna be a place that's somewhere in between it's like it's really not super-exclusive it's not like super loud it's not super geared towards VIP like in super crowded we're getting elbow fuck it's a moderate place where people go to have fun okay someplace that's close to where you're going to be pulling to you're now of course you could also get a van that's also a great option some sort of vehicular prepackaged vehicular pull scenario but um for example when I first started learning how to pick up I learned how to pick up by going to this place near my home it was like a ten minute walk ten fifteen minute walk for my home it was called El Rio and this wasn't like the most phenomenal awesome place in the world I mean it was San Francisco so it couldn't be by definition but still like on Monday nights they had dollar drink night I would like to meander on over there that's where I cut my teeth on learning this stuff and I would pull you know almost every week you know like some randoms no I wouldn't wasn't gonna wait I would just like pull these randoms back to my house and sometimes would work out sometimes it wouldn't but it was very easy to get him to go with me because of the the place that was like a place where people went to have fun right there's two kinds of clubs in my opinion there's the clubs where people go to look cool and then there's a cos we're gonna have fun and cut loose and those are generally gonna have a higher DTF quotient than the places where they they go to look cool cuz like a lot of these places where they go to look cool its girls just like Instagram like making weird faces on their drinks in the VIP so they can show it off on Instagram they all come it's a big group that's gonna be super protective of each other etc etc whereas in the more fun place more lay back there do they have a good time and enjoy life right going even beyond that you want to choose the group you go out with sometimes I'm out there and I see these in these like pick up heavy venues like I'll see like you know a big group of like five or six dudes out there and there's like swarming and shits like look you gotta you got to think about this more strategically I think the best you want to find like one or maybe maybe two guys to go out with you don't want to be rolling out in these giant fucking cock bars dude because a it's your most like in the form of do a chode crystal and it looks like this it's like chode crystal of dudes standing there like you know a cock farm even rolling up to the door is gonna look cancerous you know like cancer AIDS but just thinking of the logistics like if there's like five of you you're probably gonna be like approaching the same girls maybe even battling for them ideally again you want like two or three focused gentlemen there's no need for this like giant circus right so you got a good wing maybe like two good wings that can handle things logistically that can handle you know like hemp the peer group and stuff like that but it's not gonna become this like bloated circus where it's completely out of control additionally beyond that there's one more thing to take into consideration here and that's choosing your night choosing the wind go not just where but also when now of course the conventional wisdom would tell you what that you go out on Friday and Saturday that's the nights are gonna have the most opportunity that's the night the most people are out right no more people equals more hot girls equals more up to bats equals more chance to pull correct true I again it makes sense logically but if you think about it a little bit deeper it's not necessarily the case because when they go out like when people not just girls but people people go out on Friday or Saturday it's usually more of an event right so they're like okay and they're like talking to each other beforehand during the week like we're doing it Friday we're going to the club get ready get all dressed up we're gonna hang out with a big peer group of you know five to seven people and we're all gonna be there right so then they go there and then you're like hey Here I am mr. pickup McGee and it's time to poll well now there's like the judgement of the group there's all these logistical dynamic maybe that somebody drove someone else and maybe they're in from like out of town they're staying on their couch and they can't ditch them etc etc so it becomes a little there's a lot more logistical difficulty in my opinion to doing like a quickie Paul on on a Friday or Saturday night now this is why I always say the weekday night actually like the secret of the professional if you will because I'd say about 50% of my like same dipoles from the club have been from like a random Tuesday night or something like that because if you hit like the Tuesday bar again most likely it's not like some big group date decided to have this like event on Tuesday we're all going out etc etc so let's say I go to like you know you go to your local neighborhood pub on Tuesday night and you walk in there and you see okay there's like two girls sitting in the bar or one girl if there's one girl sitting at the bar there what does that tell me she probably had some like issue something like traumatic issue like a breakup or she just bummed out about something work she just went down there and like possibly even specifically she's there to actually get laid I mean that could also I mean I've had that certainly happened to myself as well or if just like a couple girls they're just like catching up and shit like that all you got to do is go in it's much more laid-back of the vibe the the whole like shield against like defend against guys trying to get laid and pick us up is a lot lower because it's just like fucking Tuesday it's like if you're there on like Saturday they're like okay we're gonna go out the guys are gonna come to us well dressed to the nines we got to defend don't turn it up but again on a Tuesday they're just like hanging out if you go and chill normal and cool and you win both of them over a lot of times the friends good yeah nice to meet you yeah go home with them and it's much much easier Nepal again I'd say about 50% of the time that I've pulled from from a bar or a club same night it's been during one of the week weekday nights right or even like a Sunday afternoon for that matter I remember if you've seen my hot seat there's one where I I'm hanging out at I've been day drinking and I roll into this look local like shitty dive bar near my home and I'm just like again and there with my girlfriend at the time and a couple my boys and we're just having some drinks I know it's it's still light outside literally it's like 8:00 p.m. you know in June so light outside and all of a sudden in come this gaggle of woo girls which if you don't know what whoo girls is it's like you know 20 21 year old girls like that are like like trying to dance on the bar and shit and I'm just like good evening my name is Jesus and bang next you know one thing leads to another we're doing a happy family aka three-way makeout and and I just we just my girlfriend I just pull her into the man done deal I got a Sunday so again a lot look for look for these like non non traditional or the venues that you'd think might not be the best sometimes there's hidden hidden gold hidden nuggets of gold in there so and honestly between you and me like yeah like I said before again I got to reiterate this don't use us as an excuse well Jeff said don't go to the best shit it's not the best for pickup you need to learn how to operate in those venues okay you need to learn to go to places that are outside of your comfort zone that seem cooler that have cooler people so you can you know it's like lifting heavy weights right it's like lifting heavy weights you learn how to operate in the super loud super crowded super attention you know deficit environment and how to get past the door and all that shit and how to talk to those you know girls in the superhot cocktail dress but by the same token you're also you know you can also go off the beaten path and you can also be ready for anything and that's really why we do this again that that example that the video is show the posse of that Sunday Paul that is why we do this I've never thought of going out to do pickup as a means as an end unto itself right I don't want and to be fair very rarely do I be like hey lat guys let's go beast right I just go out with my friends at this point and then I see a girl I like I know I have the skill and the reference experiences and the and the you know again the knowledge to actually go up and have a very very good chance of making something happen and pursuing this further getting her attracted to me and might take going home or weather or whatever going out with her later etc etc because I've put in my time right like I said I always thought cold approach as as a way of doing those reps and building that improved level of social intelligence so then when I'm out and I'm going about my daily life whether that's on a Tuesday afternoon in a shitty dive bar or at the hottest club Miami I'm able to be effective and that's why we do this right that's the end goal and that's what it's all about so hope you enjoy this video and I'll see you next time and now it is time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the SATs at SATs at 80% of the time this is the problem Hey but the way he said it was it lacked that conviction he's like you're hot it has this wavering tonality of the voice this is the root of the mouth right here okay not just being loud but being clears [Music] it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of a long-term health for your voice you're gonna be able to go out in  my family  [Music],Ho6N1-eoYGs

"know what up is Jeff and I'm here today to tell you about the closest thing to magic fill attraction that you're ever going to find some are SD and in game can you imagine what your life would be like if you could get ten times better results for your game than what you're getting right now regardless of how beginner or how advanced maybe when I perfected it elusively obvious part of my game girls work for me look at it differently they were only looking at so let me ask you this has this ever happened to you you approach a performin you attempt to strike up a conversation only to have them completely fucking ignore you maybe they didn't hear you think so you know you repeat your opening line again and this time you think it's a louder voice well they simply continue their conversation as though you weren't even there literally you have failed to even enter into their consciousness as a being worthy of recognition like without skipping a beat the girl that you talk to he just turns her back keeps talking to a friend leaving you standing there with your dick in your hand the girls won't even fucking look at you even if you're doing everything right and meanwhile other dudes that maybe aren't even as good-looking as you are roll up yell idiotic nonsense the girls were loving them and it's not fair really if you think about it because you've actually put in work at this whole picking up girls thing you've seen other guys apply pick up material and be successful so you know it's actually possible but for some reason you can't even get past the fucking hook you know the techniques you've seen every RSD video but for some reason you just can't seem to get past the opener with anything resembling consistency so what happens after all this rejection you start walking through the club in fear in a literal state of terror and anxiety we've all seen it you're shuffling around you know intermittently struggling up the courage to do another half-ass approach that you don't even expect to work to be honest and this time the girl might ask you to repeat yourself twice what right right and of course it's all downhill from there next thing you know what is it well cool well and she excused herself to the restroom and this is the cycle this is the downward spiral that's stifling you more and more and it's not just at the club either maybe at work you're considered an easy target you know you're the guy that gets steamrolled over toss you over during the meetings maybe you find yourself in the room with the right person who could help your business and you can't even give him your pitch without cringing at the sound of your own voice even it like family gatherings nights out with the boys you just can't seem to get a word in edgewise and your opinions are just kind of dismissed you're filled with creativity and personality but something is in the way of you being able to share that with the world your desire to engage your desire to connect to express yourself all that is somehow being blocked and shoved down and twisted into this grotesque lump of shame and fear you're locked in this like abstract prison of your mind and it's driving you slowly insane now what if all that shit could be fixed literally overnight no instructor in a red coat yelling at you berating you know watching that blonde bombshell's ass walking away from you with a you know the drink that you bought her no more of the dehumanizing rejections I've been doing public speaking since 2002 and when I go on stage what I want to do is I want to create a powerful experience that helps people get engaged in our material so when they leave that event they leave feeling absolutely inspired absolutely motivated to take action so what I'm speaking what I want to do is take you to another place just with my voice and I use the same technique sort of taking up girls sometimes of loud other times I speak quietly but when I approach a girl and I say good evening she immediately looks manias she's locked in right she's intrigued she's waiting to see what I'm going to say next she can't get enough with my stories she's laughing her ass off she's feeling all the good emotions that come from that and she's associating those feelings with me basically it's on and you know what comes next it's a hint it's a rated M for Mature all right but the thing is I didn't always have this verbal firepower okay when I first started doing pickup I blurt out these like weaksauce little meek openers and the girls would look at me like I was a fucking loser and quite frankly I was but even when I started getting success I'd often find myself unable to compete with the loud music the lights the alcohol in the club for her attention the bottom line I learned how to project the hard way in the trenches and even after I learned how to speak confidently and you know be engaging it still took me years to learn the science behind the art so I learned that and then I added these professional secrets of my own no vocal street smarts in order to take things to the next level and the results have been insane what's the point you ask the point is I get it okay I know what it's like and I've perfected the process for you so you can just plug and play easy peasy look oftentimes guys are saying the exact same things than I am verbatim but it just doesn't work and that's because 93% of communication is nonverbal it's not just the words you say your tonality or physiology also played massive parts in your communication so this program is denied you full access to that 93% your speaking voice is the most important communication tool that you possess and resonator well it's truly a magic pill because unlike other pickup programs that contain you know 57 hours of abstract inner game ideas it must be puzzled over and slowly digested and internalized this program simply brings together a series of very simple vocal storytelling and humor developing exercises that you simply engage with for time to fix this issue once and for all and once you know the stuff it's like discovering a superpower that you didn't know you had before this is the reason why I can go up and boom get attraction from a girl pretty easily without really doing anything that unusual it just kind of looks like I'm going up and saying hi look women are making value judgments on you as soon as you open your mouth in a matter of seconds they're going to decide where they want to listen to you or not so if your voice is Meek uninteresting it's like a fuck it like a child's voice you're going to be dismissed instantly if they find your conversation boring and humorless they're going to want to get the fuck away from you as soon as humanly possible and again this is the secret key to hooking the set if you can't get past the first few minutes of interaction 80% of the time this is the but here's the good news there's not a single person on the planet that can't transform their voice into a powerhouse with the right training number one you got to let the bad habits fall away and knowing what those bad habits are is half of it and knowing the correct technique is the other half literally guys like you pay two thousand dollars to have me fix this first on bootcamp I can do this without even thinking now right I put in the work I figured out the code and today I'm serving it up to you on a platter with a resonator mixing in the shit immediately improves your overall confidence so much literally that it's as good as going to years of therapy for a fraction of the cost what you're going to learn you're learning recognize the hidden ways that society is conditioning you to speak in this week childlike voice and we're going to install tools that allow you to proactively fight that conditioning off project expansively and get the results that you want so let's get down to brass fucking tacks resonator it's divided into three main parts and the first of these is vocal projection the foundation of the program centers on how to develop a very powerful and moreover a healthy vocal projection now when I first began talking about resonator and kind of throw in the product out there to the public you know I notice guys making comments here and they're like you know this is a fucking joke dude like sure Jeffy you've got good vocal projection or whatever but like how the hell is this guy actually qualified to teach this stuff well the truth is I'm not that's why I partnered with Susan Nance a professional classically trained vocal coach with over 40 years of experience in order to develop the curriculum for this section what I wanted to do I wanted to bring the best of both worlds the the raw pickup game experience as well as the more academic knowledge when it came to perfecting vocal projection so over the course of the seminar you'll see as Susan runs me through a comprehensive examination of the topic complete with interactive exercises that address every angle every my mute detail of what goes into having a powerful voice in a turn I bring my own experience to bear as we discuss the ramifications that each new discovery has for pick and then share that with a live audience and I'm bringing folks up to run them through each exercise until we've addressed their internal issues and you see it all happen live you're right there with us now look everything about your communication starts with posture and alignment so if you follow pick up for a while you might have heard the Alexander Technique and most people tend to think of this as a way to fix your posture but they don't realize that it was actually developed to fix a vocal problem so you think I was header technique you will achieve this PA a confident neutral posture both sitting and standing that protects freedom strength awareness choice and sets you up physiologically to project your voice so as we go through this section we pinpoint that we learn how to avoid low consciousness stage that results in an unattractive and unhealthy posture you're going to learn how to systematically release these holding patterns of fear and anxiety that cause ask if locked posture the Telegraph the wrong things to women and once you know this stuff your breaths going to be freer your voice is going to be louder to be fuller you'll feel open you'll feel confident you'll even feel taller now if posture is the foundation of vocal projection your breath is actually the fuel so as we move on you're going to learn foundational breath management techniques that are going to give you a clarity of intent that are going to keep you grounded in the present moment even after a bad rejection most people they have no idea why their voice is hoarse and damaged by the end of the night so in this section you're going to find out why this happens and furthermore you're going to learn how to prevent it from ever happening again no more laryngitis no more scratchy voice you've probably heard the conventional wisdom about vocal projection that says what speak from the diaphragm in this section we're going to show you what this actually means and we're going to show you how to train yourself to do it without even thinking once those are dialed we get into the nitty-gritty of the actual tone production now professional vocalist know precisely how the various components of the physical apparatus work together in harmony and they train to optimize that so here you're going to learn the science of your vocal anatomy so you know exactly what's going on physically when you speak I'm going to show you how to find your perfect speaking range pitch wise that's a little powerful as well as effortless and the aim here is to expand your tool wise give you different options in your approach because look the environments that we meet and interact with people in their dynamics so you're going to need those options and you'll get them all here we're going to identify different voice types and help you find which one's best for you which one are you currently using which is the one that you should be using how to use melodic tonality to achieve a hypnotic charismatic effect as opposed to a flat and boring tonality that turns the girls off and you know makes them blow your ass off so next we get into the almost magical phenomenon called resonance once we know how to actually produce the sound we can start to play with different tools to modulate it in order to generate a more compelling a more charismatic it is generally more pleasing tone you're also going to learn secrets of voice amplification that essentially turn your mouth into a bullhorn okay and let you grab her attention bang right off the bat how to find your optimal vocal resonance how to eliminate nasal tonality that rubs people the wrong way how to bounce the sound so it's not only loud but again Pleasant the air actually attractive and furthermore I'm going to show you how different sounds are produced in different parts of the mouth and how to manipulate that for maximum effect basically what we've shown you how to do here is you'll learn how to add a color in the auditory space with your voice and finally at the end of this section I give you several exercises to improve the clarity of your speech through articulation then we get deeper and I reveal the secret sauce so to speak that allows opera singers have you heard over instruments without using a microphone and this is called a ring and the mastery of this technique what it does it gives you a very distinctive a very brilliant sort of ringing quality to the timbre of your boys we're going to show you how to alter the shape in the position of the larynx to actually create this sort of laser-like effect somebody who has a naturally small voice who does not know how to do ring they won't be able to be heard over the music over at your average club or bar a small voice with ring will be able to be heard so even if you don't have a loud voice naturally with this you can loud enough to be heard and you can become loud enough to actually communicate your intentions and once you got this down like I said as this kind of brilliance to your voice and it opens the door to other important qualities like spin Sparkle you'll learn how to play with different variables to manipulate the sexual energy in your communication then we get into tonality emotion and conviction what this means we're going to bring it all together we're going to learn how non verbals contribute to the perfect communication style gestures facial expressions pauses tempo these are all different variables and I'll show you how to use these to shape and sort of create the exact emotional nuance you want for your message beyond all of this we're also including a broad suite of vocal exercises on mp3 that you can engage with daily anytime anywhere you know in your car during your commute listen to it on your phone to give your mind body and voice the power that you need to get maximum results with women like I said you can listen to on your phone anytime anywhere and these techniques are very easy to understand and they are immediately beneficial if you think about it you know a top athlete would never run a race about warming up first and it's the same for your voice so using these exercises as you head the club it's going to ensure you're operating at the highest level possible now these segments alone would be more than enough to solve most guys dishes almost immediately however vocal projection is just the foundation of this program and when I first came up with the idea for resonator it was in fact focus solely on voice however my good friend Ellen cooks he came to me like Jeff why not add even more value and take this thing to the next level you know he's like you've always been a phenomenal storytelling using humor in your games what you're known for let's add that in as well and I realized was like yeah actually he's right you know I'm known in the pickup community for having solid verbal game it's sort of my thing okay well that and having sex in an old dilapidated van but I digress okay it struck me that I had never really explored those concepts in depth before and so what I did was I got down to biz and I created some new content specifically for resonator first of these is called the grammar of storytelling the ability to weave a compelling tale of seemingly nothing is one of the most powerful tools I have in my arsenal when I'm taking a Blin and you might have heard this described as you know the million dollar mouthpiece that ability to just talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk talk endlessly and never run out of the interesting things to say now if you're one of the guys that struggles with this and many many do it's likely because you're looking at things the wrong way so in this segment I'm going to change the way that you view this little part of the game forever look I said it before I'll say it again the number one rule of game is what change their mood not their mind when I'm picking a girl up I move her emotionally not logically people make decisions from an emotional space honestly I'm a very average guy in almost every way right there's a million guys that look like me on an attractiveness level I mean hell there's a million guys look far far better than me on an attractiveness level yet I'm still able to get results that are light years past the vast majority of guys and this is why you might have a strong clear intent the girl knows that you want to leave into you she understands but if she hasn't emotionally engaged she just not gonna do it so when you get them to share an emotional experience it makes all the difference in the world most people are in a box you're in a box that constrains you from the loading properly so in this section I'm going to give you the key to unlock and break out of that box so you never judge yourself again and once you know this your entitlement comes in mind you'll stop feeling stifled when you approach girls that are you know highly attractive stop getting jammed and stuck in your head I'll show you furthermore how to become relatable to the girl regardless of your background regardless of your current situation I talked about leveraging the power of vulnerability and I'm going to share a very deep and personal story from my past that illustrates this power in a huge way but ultimately you're going to learn how to let go you learn how to share your emotional truth in a way that is completely irresistible and of course it wouldn't really be a Jeffie program without a solid dose the funny funny ha-ha okay that's why the next section or the resonator program is the mastery of humor look every girl says it right I want a guy who makes me laugh it's a universal fad and that's why humor is at the top of the resonator pyramid because it's the spice that makes all the vocal training and all the storytelling just pop look they say laughter is the best medicine correct I can tell you from the personal experience you know it's also the best aphrodisiac now you might be thinking well Jeff you know you're a funny guy you crack jokes bah bah I'm not like that That's not me when I try to crack jokes people just don't find it funny they don't laugh or worse they get fucking offended let me tell you something I certainly did not start out with the ability to make women laugh I mean I guess they were laughing at me I suppose huh but this was something that I had to cultivate over time and along the way I discovered that there are rules that govern comedy and with practice anybody can learn to dramatically improve their sense of humor comedy is a craft and if you're not skilled at this even the best joke can be ruined with poor delivery so in this section I'm going to show you all the pitfalls to avoid you're also going to get a variety of exercises that will help you to not only train your sense of humor but also help you to loosen up and just let go in the club when you go out at night further we're also going to talk about the absolutely crucial element of timing and how to master it I go through I list all the different types of categories of humor so you can find the one that resonates most with your personal style and you can internalize that you could hone it to a razor's edge I'll show you how to recover when your jokes bomb and your very fucking moron and how to come out looking like you actually meant to do that most importantly I'm going to give dozens and dozens of my personal best jokes and lines that I actually use in my interactions to move things forward in a fun and a cool way while I lead her back to my place for you know the sexy times calm so beyond all of that here's what else I've included in resonator first the power of misdirection in this section what I did I recruited a professional magician that I know to go ahead and approach people on the street and perform a variety of tricks with the cameras rolling now this isn't meant to be from the static call back to the early days of pickup or guys walk around with like a prop bag and doves and do magic tricks all right so this is instead I think the point is to show you exactly how this amazing performer uses storytelling how he uses what's known as patter to direct people's attention to where he wants it to go so what we do is we watch it you know him doing this we break it all down we explain what's going on psychologically and then we explore how you can actually use these principles to actually get laid without using any corny props or tricks unless of course you want to use the corny processing trick and in that case we also explain why it might be counterproductive and further how to present it in a way that comes across actually cool it doesn't make you look like you know the dancing monkey entertainer guy and last but certainly not least you want to see how the rubber meets the road right like how does all this stuff actually translate to picking up girls and this being RISD we definitely braid the motherfucking reel so we include some infield Clips starting with the following number one infield coaching with breakdown in this clip you're going to watch as they take a student with extremely poor vocal projection and humor critique his approach demonstrates the correct way and then walk him through the exercises until he actually gets results and he actually gets glory in the night with a young lady and along the way of giving detailed breakdown of exactly what's going on the next clip Jeffie vanpool from the club okay and in this one this wonderful clip I need a young lady and employing the vocal techniques outlined in resonator I'd be guile and enchanter until she enthusiastically agrees to accompany me out of the club and to my van vehicle located several blocks away as with the previous clip I pop up at key moment to the corner of the video - to freeze-frame things like Zack Morris from Saved by the Bell okay and explain the underlying nuances that are at play so you have a crystal clear idea of what a resonator pickup looks like why it works and how you can go out and do the same thing that very night so given all of this value and given how easy it is to actually integrate the stuff in your game almost immediately really don't make sense for you to wait another day to get started with the resonator literally just the vocal projection segments alone are worth many times more than also the program if you were actually to travel and take the kind of vocal coaching lessons that are included here it would cost you at least $1,500 at the average hourly rate and possibly a lot more depending on the teacher and even then you'd be dealing with a vocal coach who has no specialization and pick up and who in fact might even be actively against the idea okay and furthermore if that weren't already enough reasons enough value provided for you to get on board right now we're including a bonus package for those who sign up within the first two weeks you get one free day of Vegas immersion three resonator gold live events access to the resonator Facebook tribe a special teleconference where you can ask me anything as well as a special infield video series that I call the karaoke chronicles which features me at karaoke so let's recap you get the resonator vocal projection suite worth at least 1500 bucks the grammar of storytelling mastering humor the power of misdirection with street magic infield coaching with breakdown - Jeffy Van Thal the karaoke chronicles and all the other bonuses and of course beyond that we're offering our usual 30-day money-back guarantee now at this point I've given you a taste for what to expect in this program and the program is designed to exceed your expectations that I've already set for you here so sign up go through the program in its entirety if you genuinely feel like it wasn't worth three times the value you paid simply email support at real social dynamics comm within 30 days and we'll refund every cent all right no no hassles no questions asked we'll still be friends although I'm notified every time it happens and I cry very hard each time but but don't worry about it at the end of the day our goal is to get your game absolutely juiced up with this experience that's going to transform the way that you communicate forever you'll breathe you'll speak with your whole body you'll discover how it feels to be truly engaged in value giving as a speaker and you'll develop increased awareness of all the stuff that is only going to encourage continual development of yourselves make your voice the ideal expression of who you want to be and showcase the exact characteristics of your personality that you want to see become more articulate with crisp committed speech organize your thought make your point in a compelling manner be in control of the emotions that you want her to feel when she's listening start hooking those sets start getting attraction and start actually getting laid the raw ingredients are there let resonator turn him into gold today okay so let's do a quickie little breakdown on what happened there and I would have time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the set set set set 80% of the time this is the problem [Music] [Applause] Hey hi freeze motherfucker ain't good evening he doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him so why the sky the function she this is the roof of the mouth right here right yes smelling something nice touching shoulders ah that's the touchdown right they're not just being loud but being clear so that's right sometimes people will say what they heard you they heard the noise good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purse for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps with cheese and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding that was good so uncomfortable you look at Ellen Jared ah  how nice clenching it here notaries yeah and that's what we don't want ok that's we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow they're swollen this is probably what my boss's cords look like Island City out of me thanks Eddie Pond what the fuck you talking about oh I'm like literally cringing she was like my boy toe is like oh like average above average but yours is like me yeah don't do this don't mix it down shut up flip-flop the other two gear down you're down your job yeah yeah you're dumb your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional attunement where we're telling stories do you want to be more excited or do you need to be more like calm and collected and that will change often dynamically during the interaction adults it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice you're going to be able to go out and take your finger like this and push it push it and then and that weird and so weird to think when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I totally believe it it's only a matter of time until they like awesome and now my family gave me a huge for wear of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicality behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling in Toomer sit on a pretty low father like hello LM LM Raj you know I write that you know some little act and that success mostly quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game contest as like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself Jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve we're so so so long Oh  you  [Music]",JdD_a_GA9vQ
yo yo yo what's up it's Jeffy and today we're going to talk about cultivating the quality known as resilience now I know that I did a blog not too long ago about motivation however you know these two things are very similar however resilience is slightly different motivation it's more about getting your ass up out of your chair to go and do something whereas with resilience we're talking about how you respond when you face the inevitable setbacks ok now I've been a practitioner of cold approach pickup for over 11 years ok and during that time I have had countless ups and downs I mean yes I've had threesomes with the models and all that yada yada but I've also been called a creep loser midget asshole cretin whatever etc etc you name it basically more than anybody watching this video combined you know I mean I've had times where I'm on top of the world just own and shit racking up girls like a motherfucking boss and of course conversely I then also had periods where it seemed like I couldn't get laid to save my life sometimes for months at a stretch but through it all something kept me persevering through regardless of the immediate circumstances and above all I'd say that this is what actually enabled me to gain the relative mastery of this skillset that I possess today and when the going gets tough the tough get laid and so that's going to be the topic of today's blog cultivating the quality known as resilience so what exact what is that exactly what does it mean to be tough ok and what we're talking about here is the ability to modulate and constructively harness the stress response and this is going to be absolutely essential to not only your physical and mental well-being but by extension your ability to persevere through the bullshit that one will typically encounter when embarking on a journey to develop your social skills in a pickup context put into me this is the one quality that determines your success or failure when it comes to pick up more than any other because in any worthwhile endeavor you're going to encounter setbacks and the people who are able to react to those setbacks productively are going to see the greatest improvements uh you know no matter how many videos you watch how many seminars you attend no matter how many approaches that you have done if you if you do not have that ability to slog through the pain periods where you don't see an immediate result well then you're going to fail alright that's kind of the bottom line whether a guy sticks at it or gives up in the face of adversity is dependent on a variety of factors and these are going to be both genetic and environmental now obviously we can't alter our genes yet and even environmental factors can largely be beyond our control such as say being born into poverty or experiencing some sort of horrible childhood trauma however it is very possible to improve your level of resilience through a handful of actual practical strategies so let's get right to it the conventional wisdom says that stress is a bad thing okay however if you really think about it our very existence on this planet is stress okay because in every moment of every single day you've got the gravitational force of the fucking planet trying to keep you plastered to the fucking floor so it's our resistance to this stressor of gravity that resulted in the development of your bones and your muscles and without stress you would quickly become weak which is why astronauts like you know Chris Hatfield on the International Space Station he has these videos he goes on YouTube and you should check them out they're very very interesting but anyway that's why astronauts on the space station they work out with specially designed exercise equipment two hours a day so the idea the takeaway here being adversity that you can master and overcome causes you to grow so a tough guy is not somebody who avoids stress but somebody who learns how to tame and master it now the good news is that pretty much anybody can increase their resilience with pract and the strategies that we're going to discuss here today include number one the ability to regulate emotions number two embracing an optimistic yet realistic outlook number three working out number four excepting progressively more difficult challenges number five maintaining a closed social network and number six imitating imitating resilience role models so the first one is regulating emotions now negative emotions are a natural and healthy response to stress and it can frequently act as sort of signposts in fact to help you direct your attention in a in a productive way however if left unchecked you know to run rampant throughout your brain well then they can cloud your judgment and adversely affect your ability your ability to make good decisions while under pressure so there are a couple of proven ways to improve your response to negative emotions and one of these is through the practice of mindfulness meditation which is of course something that I've talked about in this video blog in the past and if you want to go deeper on that topic you should definitely check that video out to get them kind of more detailed breakdown of precisely how meditation can affect your brain in ways that are going to result in a more adaptive response to stress but for our purposes today however all you need to know is that meditation essentially trains you to consciously live in the present moment as opposed to hand wringing over your past failures or stressing out about the future you learn to watch but not judge how your mind will tend to automatically adhere to condition patterns of thinking that often increase your stress level kind of like this negative feedback loop so that's one meditation but the other way to attenuate your negative emotions is through a process called cognitive reappraisal and with this technique you basically reinterpret the meaning of an event to see it as less negative and like meditation this cognitive reappraisal process actually causes changes in the brain which which correlate to both increases in positive emotions and faster recovery from feelings such as anger fear disgust etc so when you're doing this cognitive reappraisal tactic technique what have you the way to go about it is you're going to ask yourself questions to bring yourself around to a different way of looking at things and one of those questions might be am i exaggerating the negative impact of this experience okay so for example on the forum from time to time you'll see people whinging and whining saying things such as oh I meditated too much and now I feel detached and my life is ruined because of RSD okay or maybe you'll see like the girl said a mean name to me and I can't get it out of my mind or I was a mugged by a dude and I can't get out of my mind blow outs I'm getting blowouts and it's really a messing with my self-esteem and I feel like I'm worse off than when I began now of course I'm not hating on these because back in the day I went through these feelings to back in 2000 to 2003 when I was first learning this stuff in the boards on the old Usenet forums but asking yourself this question am i exaggerating the negative impact of this experience can actually help you to see that you know what it's really not that bad you're still in good health you're still you know got a roof over your head and some guy calling you a mean name at the bar isn't that fucking bad or looking at things with a with a new set of eyes say for example becoming detached from the meditation why not that might not be so fucking terrible either all right so that's one question now another question you could ask yourself with cognitive reappraisal would be is there something that I can learn from this all right so let's say for example you come out of the bathroom after you've been talking to a girl for 40 minutes and you see her leaving with some other guy or she's talking with some other guy and you just stand there and and you you know you sink into this miasma despair and you don't go back in you don't get her back and then she fucks off with the dude so saying what can I learn from this well maybe next time I could go in and attempt to get her back maybe next time instead of saying that comment to the friend that resulted in the friend blowing up and cock-blocking hard I can be a bit more empathetic to the peer group next time etcetera etcetera I mean these are obviously just examples but the point being asking yourself what can I learn from this experience can kind of help to soften the blow of the negative experience itself because you know that in the future you're going to be more well equipped to handle it okay so so that's number one controlling negative emotions now the second way to go about improving your resilience would be adopting a more optimistic outlook overall okay several studies have shown that there is a correlation between a positive outlook and health and in fact even longevity and these health benefits are thought to be the result of a better regulation of the body's stress response now negative emotions often result in the flooding of your body with stress hormones you know cortisol possibly adrenaline and this is going to have the effect of one increasing physiological arousal kind of kicking that flight or fight or flight response and number two narrowing your focus of attention restricting your behaviors to those only essential for survival okay conversely positive emotions generally reduce arousal and broaden your focus opening your mind up to have more creative and flexible responses to stress a classic example of this would obviously be Alexander with RSD and if you look at his kind of natural instincts method philosophy it's basically filled with these ideas of relaxation okay he'll say you know he says the temple is or the club rather is a temple of relaxation for him and so that's how he views it he goes to the club and he induces a relaxation response another thing that he actually has is the what is he called the two-hour roll okay and the two-hour rule is basically this to the first two hours of the night when he goes to the club he treats it as though it doesn't count at all like the first two hours don't count why the idea kind of behind it being that although stranger things have happened generally you're not going to meet a girl within the first two hours of the night and fucker okay she just got there she wants to hang out with their friends so do you she wants to relax into the night herself okay now yeah obviously I've had poles at like 10:15 but they're few and far between generally you're not going to pull in the first two hours of the night so this with this hole the first two hours don't count it allows him to relax into the night okay it goes into the club there's no outcome dependence whatsoever he's not expecting anything to happen so it really takes that burden off of his shoulders and he says for the first two hours I just you just get to relax into the night and again the underlying thing here is generating a relaxation response now when you look at Alex when I'm winging with him or you watch his videos is infield one thing that you'll really notice is is the guy's extremely creative I'll be hanging with the dude winging them in set and some of the shit that comes out of his mouth it was just absolutely hilarious like where the hell's this guy getting this shit from right and it's because he's unstyled himself he's letting his mind flow freely that relaxation response allows him to be more creative and flexible in the field all right now so again this is how optimism and you know having a generally more positive outlook can have a very tangible effect on your game and field I mean let's look at the opposite I see students who are stressing balls and they they could those get blown blown out all night now one caveat here however is that this optimism needs to be tempered with a healthy dose of a realism you're not just throwing on the rose-colored glasses and you know blithely going about thinking everything is perfect you shouldn't ignore negative feedback to the contrary you should carefully examine your bad sets or the mental issues that tripped you up in the field looking for that relevant information that can be used to avoid similar situations in the future all right now I've always said that it's the man who's willing to put himself on the cross and be honest about where he's fucking things up that's going to actually get good at this if you're just going out and banging your head against the wall in some misguided like blind faith attempt that if I simply accrue enough approaches then I'm going to get good no matter what okay if that's the way you're thinking well then you might be languishing in that particular pickup purgatory for a very long time indeed so anyway the takeaway here is train yourself to and interpret ambiguous situations in a more positive manner but at the same time be honest with yourself about where you're screwing up and take pains to address these areas as you discover them so now the third point here might seem a bit obvious okay but hitting the gym and working out can also make you a more a tougher more resilient person now a lot of times people see that all the ins pretty much all of the instructors and RSD are pretty fit and work out regularly modern nutrition etc etc work out we hit the gym and so people see this and they jump to the conclusion that we recommend working out solely for the improvement that you know the the concomitant improvement in your physical appearance so they'll be like see I knew that looks matter they go to the gym okay great you know look I know it's fantastic to look good naked okay and I know all about it but ultimately the benefits of working out go far far deeper it really has more to do with the energy that you bring to the interactions having that vitality just kind of adds to your Nimbus now remember whatever you feel they feel and so being fit it's going to just exude a positive energy that people just generally want to be around and over the years I've noticed that the guys on boot camp who are more fit tend to do better and not necessarily because of appearance reasons but because they're better able to weather the storm of going out night after night just the physical toll long-term okay working out protects you against the negative effects of stress all right exercise boost levels of endorphins it boost levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin that can reduce depression and elevate your overall mood working out it also improves attention it improves planning it improves decision-making and improves memory and all of these things are of course going to be very important for effectively managing stress working out also appears to activate genes for certain proteins that promote the growth and repair of neurons so there's again tons of tons of really tangible benefits now for years personally I sort of and this is kind of like a related but tangential thing here for many years I kind of just flailed around in the gym with this idea that you know more is better and I sort of indiscriminately threw the iron around kind of haphazardly choosing the weight for a session a given session with apparently no rhyme or reason to it like I just be like oh this seems heavy let's just do some of this okay so um so after like the first couple years right I saw those beginners gains happen then I kicked around for a couple years just sort of like plateauing around like not really just going kind of spinning my wheels not really getting stronger okay but once I started incorporating an actual programmed progressive increases in the resistance my strength began to show distinct growth again very slowly but surely and personally I use a modified version of the gym Wendler program five three one if you're curious you can check it out basically kind of based on just compound lifts with assistance exercises and high intensity interval training but anyway you know the same principle applies to pick up if you want to basically you want to carefully calibrate your exposure to the stress in a way that is known to increase resilience okay so on a bootcamp while I'm committed to push pushing the student far beyond where you push himself I'm also cognizant of this whole idea we want to we want to keep the bar high enough so it's challenging but not so high that's going to be a possible forum okay so I'm encouraging the student to celebrate small victories in the field and at the same time lean in to their edge alright just leaning into their edge leaning beyond slightly beyond their comfort zone okay so the whole time I'm just constantly gauging where your comfort level is and so over the course of the night I'm pushing you slightly beyond that bit by bit okay this is called stress inoculation and it means accepting increasingly difficult challenges so you gradually learn to handle the higher levels of stress now if you followed rst for any length of time you've most likely heard me describe my journey of learning pickup as a process of progressive desensitization alright so for example when I first started out one of the exercises that I did was to walk down the street just make eye contact with people okay because I had problems doing that I just walked out and make eye contact with people and then I started saying hi to people that I'd pass on the street some will get annoyed some would actually stop and talk to me they'd be like oh hey how you going but the vast vast majority would simply like maybe glanced up maybe grunt something back and then continue on their way alright just continue along so I was like all right oh shit like I'm still here I'm not vaporized great let's move on step two challenge up so that I started holding brief conversations with people extending those conversations injecting more my personality and humor into the conversations starting to escalate things physically getting kisses getting numbers getting dates and getting same night legs then you know increasing the difficulty mix sets hotter girls threesomes yada yada etc etc I mean hell this weekend up in Edmonton I hooked up with twins which was a first for me at this at 11 years deep a goal that I didn't even know I had until the opportunity presented itself but anyway so progressively increase the level of stress alright so you get used to it and as you gradually acclimate to more and more stress you're going to need more recovery so this goes for the gym and pickup okay one of the more important skills in this game is knowing when to take a break and step away from the whole pickup merry-go-round for a while and after a couple weeks off you kind of D load your system and you come back stronger okay okay now another extremely effective way to toughen yourself up is to cultivate strong relationships with like-minded individuals and having a solid group of friends you roll out with a crew you know that we're hitting it up with this guy should blunt your stress response and increase your confidence in tense situations okay there's strength in numbers now your wings when you're out can serve as sort of a safety net for you to kind of go back to after a particularly harsh blowout or maybe even just an aggregate of bad nights out you know you just go out and just kick it with them and this is of course one reason why we will create on boot camp something that Julian calls the hub okay and what we do is we'll gather in a specific area like say off to the side of the dance floor or something and we'll spend some time just opening girls any girls are passed by and it's the Yankee mate of the group and then opening more and then merging these sets together until we've kind of formed this super set of people just like partying off to the side of the dance floor or whatever okay now at this point we can open hot girls as they pass and pawn off these ones in the hub or we can venture out into the club and you know go go hard for a while if we get tooled or blown out or whatever head back to the hub for a little while you know get a little little recharge your social batteries and then pull them back to it so biologically I'm from a biological node social ties are known to stimulate the release of oxytocin which is like the love hormone okay and this is known to reduce anxiety by counteracting the cortisol response to stress so and furthermore yet you know oxytocin also generates feelings of trust and empathy which can be extremely helpful when you're when you're trying to do colabro pickup now a lot of guys then say well you know Jeff I currently don't have a strong support system I don't have a network of wings a crew to roll out with okay well this is obviously where an organization like RSD can come in handy to provide a like a kind of lifeline to that network of like-minded people we're going to be supportive of your goals to improve your skills the opposite sex so you can join the rst inner circle you go to the rst free tours there you'll find many people who share these goals and who are actually taking action okay and these are going to be people that you could potentially go out with another thing might be to mentor a guy in your area who's just starting out guy who's at a lower skill level than you okay so hmm finally the last way to increase your resilience is going to be to model other tough motherfuckers in your social circle okay and this could also include of course your family your co-workers your teachers or you know even historical figures or fictional characters when you're attempting to model somebody who you look up to in the game first you want to analyze their specific attitudes or behaviors that you want to imitate by breaking them down to come to their their constituent parts breaking them down into segments and then from there establishing rules for yourself based on these that you're going to adhere to going forward so if you've seen the DVD program the Jeffie show which we put out in 2007 you might recall a story I told him that about a taking his girl home after just like epic tug-of-war battle with some other dude okay and at the time this girl was probably the hottest girl I'd ever hooked up with and I've been bullshitting with her on the phone for several weeks try to control her to get her to meet out with me not having much success until finally after weeks of fucking trying it hitting it up she finally agreed to meet me out so I'd meet her at the bar everything's going great I'm like kiss and earn everything it looks like it's totally going down when all of a sudden she sees some dude she knows and so she she pops up and she runs over to this guy okay oh my god this guy's much better-looking than me quote unquote he's taller than me and he's also confident as hell so I kind of just sit there like what do I do her butt Derby until my buddy Christoph comes up and he's like he's like he's like what are you doing this segata said she's going to fucks you tonight I'm like yeah but now she's with this guy he's like what the fuck are you doing Jeffie he's like fuck this guy go get here go get ya right there's that whole lock cultivating relationships with like-minded individuals bid it play but so anyway I'm like all right yeah so I swoop back in get the girl's attention and for a while I have her but then poof she's back on him okay I bust out some joke get her attention back back and forth you know finally he pulls her down onto his lap okay I'm like fuck what do I do so I try one more time outside the bar I wait for her to come out that as she walks out I grab her I pick her up a spinner around as she's leaving the bar then the dude comes out right after her kind of grabs her hand and they started walking off they walk off down the street and kind of over her shoulder she's like we're going to the phone booth you should come with and Chris looks like alright let's go let's go out to him and I'm like dude fuck this shit you know I'm not chasing her down I'm not gonna be like her little puppy following her and her little a mug around okay so he's like sigh Kota it's uh I guess to see you next time you know and he fucks off into the night so I started walking home from the El Rio by myself and hasn't walking home I'm fucking I'm fucking crying okay now I'm also wasted in high as fuck but that's neither here nor there I mean I'm all these thoughts are going through my head like how could you do this how could you just go with that guy I thought she'd like me we have such a great you know rapport together and we talk on the phone all the time like she's totally into me I don't understand how could she just do that oh I actually sit down on the sidewalk in the darkness and I'm like just having some pity party for myself alone and on this darkened Street crying now no to that the previous week I had been down in Los Angeles at the project Hollywood mansion and I was rolling to the clubs with all these amazing players that resided in that storied mansion from the the book the game and and as I'm thinking there as I'm sitting there I'm kind of remembering these experiences and I'm I'm remembering how badass some of these guys were okay and in the midst of this little pathetic scene I think to myself what would Tyler do okay what would Tyler do on a true because I remember seeing him do this in the club like some guy would fucking take his girl BAM he'd find a way to make it make it happen to get her back okay so as I'm pondering this it came to me like a vision I see like obi-wan Kenobi in the street I see Tyler there okay the shimmering apparition of Tyler Durden ako and cook looking down at me with a stupid smirk on his face and he says yeah he's like is that yeah yeah he's like a man you know you have to do yeah it's like March back to that bar blow that motherfucker and pull that bitch back your house and fucker yeah yeah right and and I'm saying I'm like yeah yeah and so that's exactly what I did I picked myself up brush myself off marched to the bar engaged in a little more tug-of-war ultimately blew the dude out went home with the girl so long story short what happened here well as I thought about winning with Tyler the previous weekend I remembered again all of those specific instances in which he did encounter the setback and simply go back in and handle his fucking shit he'd shake off the emotional upset swoop back in and make it happen win lose or draw he wasn't gonna quit tryin till the either the chick was gone okay other guys cut him out of set like cut him out he'll go around he'll just go around I mean it was unlike anything I had ever seen before and at that moment in my like darkest hour so to speak I remembered his actions and so I modeled them and further I resolved that going forward this is how I would conduct myself in similar situations in the future now that was in 2003 but you can kind of see the same rule today with Alexander's four times rule right you can do something four times if you attempted more than four times you may be a sociopath less than that it's simply not due diligence so anyway that's about it for today I just wanted to you know talk about this because I feel that the ability to persevere through hardships is one of the main characteristics or factors that resulted in my overall success and I'd even go so far as to say the success of anybody who achieves mastery in the game so not everybody is born with a high level of resilience but anybody can improve it through the practices that I've mentioned here those are again number one regulating emotions number two realistic optimism three hitting the gym for progressively increasing the challenge five having solid wings and six modeling other Brazilian TV and facial fission and fusion and fission fission and fusion and fission and fusion and fission free

yo yo yo what up it is I your proverbial boy Jeffy and in case you've been paying attention you might realize that I'm not in fact a boy I'm just a proverbial boy I'm not a boy I'm a old-ass man I'm a 42 year old man and so the topic of this video might seem a little bit unusual considering that given that but what we're going to talk today is about high school game how to do game if you're in high school another reason that I am even doing this video despite the fact that it's been like 25 years since I was in fucking high school is that I see kids who are in our sto watch our videos and who asked how can I run game if I'm in high school now again I don't really have personal experience cuz I don't really start doing game until I was 26 years old in earnest and when I was in high school I was actually I wouldn't say a nerd but I was very academic and then transformed into like a delinquent maniac I kind of was had my feet in both of those worlds but I was never like popular per se in fact I did my best to appear invisible so it has to that was my strategy appear invisible so you don't get fucked with and that was a pretty good strategy but if I could go back in time and do things differently knowing what I know now which you know knowing what I know now about social dynamics knowing what I know now about attraction and stuff like that there's definitely a different approach that I would take now again like I said I wasn't popular in high school but I have friend of mine that I knew in junior high he who was not popular he actually became quite popular going on in high school to the point where we kind of drifted apart and the way that he did it was in eighth grade like he had again we didn't have many friends but there was this one kid he hung out with who was actually um quite popular he knew a lot of people so he asked that one friend he said hey man you got to start introducing me to some people so he actually kind of used that guy to leapfrog his popularity so that guy started introducing him around to the point where he started meeting a lot of people and then by the time he got in high school he knew a ton of people and he actually went on to become part of the clique that was actually kind of run and shit okay so I'd say though um if you're a kid in high school you know the number one thing that I'll always say my flippant answer to like how do I run game from high school it's like don't you know you're you should just be fuckin studying so you don't fuck up your future and again I do believe that that is true to an extent but by the same token you do want to have popularity to teach yourself those social skills that are going to serve you well when you get older when you get into college and it becomes more of like like kind of a set more of a sexually charged environment if you will you know in high school I know a lot of my I didn't get laid until I was 19 in college a lot of my buddies we're getting laid in high school but again the focus of high school is building basic socials because I think that should be the main focus you know if you get an actual romantic relationship out of that that's great too but again you're you're sort of building those foundational building blocks of social skill that are going to serve you an adult life I I did have kind of like a little clique that I you know sort of a localized popularity and a lot of that was in due in part to me being funny right and trying to be it like a funny guy and in class and and generally you know at lunch and so forth now there's a difference between being like funny and being like the so-called class clown and you'll know you're doing it right if even like the teacher is laughing along to your jokes right like what's an example like just doing outrageous stuff I remember one time I didn't do this but this struck out in my mind a friend of mine he there was a substitute teacher in the class and he came in a bit late right as the teacher was calling for a tennis and he had his hand up and he said raise your hand if you're here because he was about to you know do the attendance so my friend came in and he came up from behind him and he like high-fived his like a hand that was up really hard and everyone too started cracking up at that so again like little things like that in class just to get you being funny hue and outrageous stuff weird stuff I remember some of the popular kids they used to do stuff like they would wear they live like coordinate outfits and wear like weird shit to school like this one guys came to school and they essentially had like daisy dukes on I mean it's just like totally ridiculous one of them got sent home because the principal said I can see your balls right I mean but it's harmless stuff that's not gonna get you like suspended or anything like that as I go harm spun right so again cultivating that humor occulting that sort of class clown image can be very helpful to build your popularity and sort of book you know burnish your your reputation around the school another thing that I think would be very helpful and I heard I you know I've talked to people who were popular in high school in researching this and it's like just try to make one new friend a week and buy a friend I just mean somebody if you see in the hall you just pass by and give them a pound right you should you're your goal to be popular in high school should be to have as many people that you can just say what's up to in in the halls and stuff like that do you can just high five give a pound to etc so hang out like by your locker between classes and just post up just don't go straight to class that's lame like hang out do retarded shit just shoot the shit as much as you can in the hallways and like again your main goal should be like to slap hands with as many people as you see as you're walking through the halls that's just it's again it's part of the high school culture from what I understand from what I remember and it just makes you seem cooler and again memorize people's names this is one of those things that's so basic to game period right is membrane the girl's name when you're in set remembering people's names and so when you see them in the hallways like hey what's up bill hey what's up you know Sarah etc etc people love the sound of their own name now here's the thing you want to do this quickly at the beginning of the year especially if you're going to like a new school or it's like just if it's the beginning of the year make sure that you get everyone's names as soon as possible because several months in it's gonna be already kind of like established and you it won't be it won't have as much of an impact for you to be doing that and again just little things like when you talk to people literally talk to them they like they're the most interesting person you've ever taught you like genuinely pay attention to them like one of the things that made you hear talking about Bill Clinton the ex-president one of the things that make him so charismatic is people say when he's talking to you you feel like you're the only person in the room show a genuine interest in other people ask him about their opinions ask them what they like to do etcetera etcetera don't just talk about yourself all the time beyond that I'd say that you want to have diverse interests as well like one of the big things like that can help you cultivate a broader popularity or even niche popularity that can be sort of parlayed into a broader popularity is joining clubs joining you know playing sports things of that nature now for me I only did a couple of things in high school I was on the journalism thing and I was an academic decathlon so but you know just being even being in those groups exposed me to different people and don't just join the groups like the theater group the music group whatever the the football team or what have you don't just join the groups that have your friends that you already know in them get outside of your comfort zone be willing to kind of to kind of spread yourself around it be a little more diverse in your interests so you meet a wider range of people because like I said there's two kinds of popularity there's sort of that niche popular they're gonna have within specific subcultures whether it be like music theatre again the journalism thing your book etc school government sports whatever but then again you could parlay that into a broader popularity as well by again not getting not restricting yourself to just one niche I was just trying to be invisible so I wouldn't get screwed with now I would do the opposite and try to be as like trying to stand out as much as possible because we're ingrained with that social conditioning that says what the tall poppy gets cut if you know if you stick out you're gonna get slammed down right the bucket of crabs mentality but you've really got to understand that is mere social conditioning and the earlier it is that you can internalize that that that's a bullshit way to think the better off you're gonna be long term so for example if you're in gym class that you know just be in you're played sports be loud be ridiculous if they're like okay today we're gonna play kickball be like yeah like everyone else is like silent you just like scream like it's the most hilarious thing you've ever seen in your life or you're you're you're super excited for kickball like you're kickball master Z whatever that means you know again it's just gonna help you stand out tease people that you're playing on the team with if girls are on the team and they suck like tease them of course like good-naturedly and everything but but again don't be afraid to sort of be a little bit more boisterous another important thing and this goes for like just with venues in general when you're you don't you're in a bar or any place you're going to with regularity you want to get to know the people who work there that means get to know the teachers get to know the staff that work in the cafeteria get to know the janitors get to know the front office administrative staff alright because again it's all gonna contribute to this feeling of like an ecosystem where you you belong you're a part of it and then if there's a very high issue they're actually gonna have your back because you have that personal relationship with them you know looks money sad it's all that stuff it's not the ultimate determinant of attractiveness but it certainly doesn't hurt so again don't just show up like looking like you know you're wearing a potato sack that you found at the Salvation Army to make sure you're like you're you're actually putting some effort like a modicum of effort into your appearance right you know comb your hair brush your teeth make sure your hygiene is good all that stuff work out start working out early if I could have gone back in time it started like actually participating in athletics and becoming more fit when I was younger I'd be much better well much more well positioned you know in my adult life as far as fitness is concerned it's you know I don't think it's ever too early to start like taking it interested in nutrition fitness it's and and stuff like that and start to think about how you're presenting yourself from a from a fashion standpoint as well right again make it as easy as possible for yourself and last but not least you want to actually take the initiative when it comes to like socializing meeting people interacting with people don't just sit there and think that somebody's gonna take it upon themselves to put you on like oh this poor little guy he should be popular I feel bad for him let's like put him on and make him popular nobody's gonna take that initiative I hear all the time even in an adult life people saying oh nobody invites me anywhere it's like when was the last time you invited someone anywhere right so you've got to actually take the initiative to be sociable and go out and you know invite people to stuff if you see a new kid at the school go up to them and say you know introduce yourself say what's your name you know stay tuned and find some commonalities so I'd say again that's another that's one of the biggest things is taking an initiative to socialize to you know making an effort to include other people and not just being the solipsistic person that thinks that people you know the popular he's gonna come to him out of the black a bolt in the blue just because you're so awesome and cool and you deserve it right entitlement is it is not there remember people other people are insecure too so go out of your way to make them feel welcome and actually invite them to stuff as well okay now the bottom line too is of course ultimately you are there for your edge so I stick to my previous statement stay in school do your fucking homework you know follow these little tips to kind of try to make your social circle wider learn those social skills that are serve you better in your adult life when it starts and you start going out to Beast of the clubs and so forth and you'll be weird to be very well positioned to learn this stuff once you get out of high school anyway this has been Jeff II hope you enjoy this and I'll see you next time I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that completely automates the process to get any dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do this is execute the program version 2.0 the ruthlessly efficient highly repeatable system for the modern day online gangster it's over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of the infield footage broken down case Network and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you polar that night  I covered the exact repeatable pattern takes to take a girl home nearly 85% of the time she agrees to meet up with me this is my online masterpiece at bottom line - just plain works now you have a choice to make keep using the Internet to beat off or use it to have someone else speed it off for you so decide Oh faster wanna start getting laid and execute the program

welcome aboard for the third installment of the resonator preview series so in the last video I talked about how I worked with a professional classically trained vocal coach who has over 40 years of experience to develop the curriculum for this program and I really wanted to bring together the best of both worlds when it came to mastering vocal projection right the academic knowledge as well as the raw pickup game experience so when yesterday's preview video I showed you how Suzan walk me through a very comprehensive examination of the topic complete with interactive exercises that address every angle every minut detail of what goes into having a powerful voice and in the next section of the program I bring my own pickup experience to bear as we discuss the ramifications that each new discovery has for pickup and share that with a live audience with resonator first you learn the science of how to project and then we get into the art of how to use that new power to express yourself in such a way that the girls become immediately attracted to you as opposed to fucking disgusted where they want to get the fuck away from you all right now before I show you today's clip I'd like to

list so again sign up at RSU resonator calm then sit back and enjoy this installment of the resonator video preview series and in this clip we're going to be back at the mansion with Owen and we're going to get into the nitty-gritty details of exactly how and why your voice makes the girls attractive or fucking repulsed and from day we're going to see some clips from the program as well as some excerpts from this insane event we did in Los Angeles where we brought guys up we're fucking hammering with this stuff on them relentlessly onstage breaking them down brutally until we're able to pinpoint their issues and fix them in real time and it's a it's a pretty insane show I'm actually just laughing just remember remembering some of the antics lots of weird stuff going on so check it out what's up its own in Jeffie and what we're going to be talking to you about today is how to use your voice in a way that gets massive massive attraction from women and this is going to go beyond to even just say vocal training because we're going to put an emphasis here on being a guy who's picking up girls now in this I'm going to focus a lot on the elements of pickup artistry and Jeff is going to focus a lot on the elements of technique and actually that's an area where I tend to fall short like my my understanding how to drive a traction using the voice is really good but Jeff is actually dealt with really really deep on technique that's why a lot of time you hear my voice is kind of messed up from all these seminars that I do in videos that I do where Jeff is always really crisp right so I'm going to hammer in on how to bang create massive attraction using your voice and then Jeff is also going to pipe it on that but then he's going to really zero in on the technique and the reason why is because Jeff has a new program coming out on this topic so this is going to give you a lot of preview of those ideas which are ideas you can implement right now get massive massive change your results and then from there if you want to go deeper you're going to check out his program now right off the bat I'm going to lay out simple principles that you need to understand in order to get attraction using your voice and I want to be very clear as I said in previous videos I'm not going to belabor it but my major major weapon that I have to control energy and the major weapon that I have to get above better-looking guys or more successful guys is my voice and my voice isn't even very deep or you know like sexy or anything like that well depending on your your outlook but I want to beat on myself there but you see my point it's not like the traditional like very what like hello or anything like that but again even in spite of that my major weapon is my voice now what are the ideas of this first of all what are you trying to communicate in your voice and what techniques can you use so off the bat the major things you want to communicate our first of all hi status that's got to be clear second of all you've got to be communicating the emotion that you want that woman or group of people to experience the next one is that you want to be communicating that you're the guy okay and what I mean by that is like it's sort of this like there is no other option like anyone else that you look at it's fucking stupid and they're like not in like a win-lose way but just in a way where they would draw that conclusion themselves and lastly that you're already in their head and that it's just assumed that familiarity is there that you're leading it's all built into that so this is really got to come across in your voice okay you got to be sharp as a tack and they've got to really feel that male right off the bat the first one will say its dominant so you want to kind of break down the old school community idea of you know dominance and how that's a swing there's an idea of different types of tonality that you can employ this is related what we call tone production right because there's several parts that comprise vocal projection but tonality is obviously one of them so back in the day we made a distinction between a neutral tonality which is kind of like almost monotone like hey how's it going how are you doing today good to meet you versus what we call for a trying for a poor tonality we're like hey how's it going like it has a tendency to Lil to up at the end how's it going how's it go how are you right versus a breaking rapport so now they're worth almost goes down at the end looks like it what's up what's up right so we said back in the day that you know the conventional wisdom is you always want to err on the side of breaking rapport I guess that's why we used to say because somebody who has high status they're not somebody who's trying for rapport right so say that you have too many friends you're dating too many girls there's just too many there's all these people coming at you all the time well you're not going to be like hey like hoping they're going to like you so think of it like this right hey how's it going hey how's it going hey how's it going now me growing up my tonality always went up up up and the reason why is because I grew up just desperate to get reported people which was because I had no friends or at least not as many as I'm probably too light so that being the case you got to look at your voice and I'd like you to record yourself right now and say how is it going how's it going how's it going okay and notice for me actually by the way you do the down better than I do because my tonality is not as dominant as yours is actually funny enough so I tend to be more towards neutral you tend to be more towards down or and here's where it gets even crazier though by the way at a certain point when you've reached a certain status even if you try to do the up it sounds kind of fake yourselves neutral right yeah like if you're like like hi what I'm trying I'm trying for rapport it sounds neutral mmm so so it's funny like as you shift internally even if you do that you know trying for rapport thing like hey how's it going like that like you could almost tell that it's you're still that dominant do so as you become better to use your voice you get better responses which then shifts your inner game you become more dominant and then funny enough you don't even need to worry about it so much anymore so don't panic you're not spending regressor life worrying about it yeah it's interesting too because a lot of times you guys may hear what they're you know you want a breaking report finality so then they go in and then but then they're just they take it almost at extreme where it's like it's almost like aggressive and frightening we want you to be aggressive but again what most people think when they hear aggressive scary yeah right scary so but when we're talking about aggression we talk about expressing that in a fun and cool way as opposed to a scary way so when you bring those two together you get what's called a positive dominant tonality so if you think again how would how would you say the word hey an extremely positive way like hey right and then how would you say an extremely dominant way like like a cop you know they're like all right freeze motherfucker right so you combine the two and that's when you get that positive dominant so it's like it sounds like a coven a cocky frat boy type of tone I was like hey what's up good evening it's a pleasure to meet you allow me to introduce myself so it's kind of like it's got that fun edge to it as well but it's not seeking rapport so even do that right now as an experiment trigon hi how's it going hi how's it going hi how's it going then try try being then take the positive neutral and then say negative light like like you know so take out the inflection and just be like hi how's it going hi how's it going hi how's it going so you see those that right there okay and actually pause the video and do this right now again we said the first one is dominance the next one is the emotion that you want them to feel so if you want the girl to feel positive around you you add in that positive emotion so now you have the dominance and now you're adding in positivity so hey how's it going good to meet you right so they're feeling a happiness coming from you but it's a happiness where you're not chasing after rapport and what you want to do is go into your body and remember this thing called mirror neurons and so what you do is you go you feel good in your own body you set the tone and then you also have dominant tonality sort off the bat now she's feeling good and she's feeling this a high value dude leveraging that emotional contagion effect you're going to draw them into that emotional space if you will and then with your vocal tonality you're getting the dominance and that's positive about me it's pretty simple yeah now from there what you got to do is you want to be right in their head so the way that I would imagine it is almost as if like like what I'm speaking you right now in my mind I am your thought there's not this question mark of whether or not like in my mind you're already thinking what I'm saying it's already there it's like we're one mind and I'm speaking right into your minds almost like a leper and right brain and the right brain is speaking so that the whole brain can hear it so you might have seen exercising we've done like that it's like I'm in your head and literally it's like I'm in your head so I want you to feel dominance happiness and that I'm in your head now as soon as I'm questioning whether or not you'd want to hear what I have to say it I'm like so so say I even in the positive dominance I'm like I'm like hey like it's not it's like this like like it's kind of hard for me to even do it like this but I'm going to try to question myself hey what's up it's Owen like you said there's does that hesitation there right where I'm not sure if you've let me in or it's almost like when you feel like a kid trying on his dad's suit or something it doesn't fit right you don't I mean there's something slightly off about it you know it's like that uncanny valley almost when you have a guy who's Walker's I guess talking the talk but not internally walking the walk right because he's like do I want to communicate with him he's not even sure there's not even sure if he wants to get in their head like when we're speaking on to the camera or we're speaking in front of a crowd or when we're approaching a woman in a nightclub or on the street or what-have-you I'm not like do I want to approach her I'm like no I'm going to speak to her and and she's going I am going to be the thought in her head why not because I achieved it and I won but rather because I'm just again it's just I'm seeing it as a collaborative it's a win-win for her to speak with me right it's a win-win her day is going to be enhanced by that and that's what enables me to have that kind of rock-solid unwavering conviction behind the tonality so made okay so we would say the start is dominance the second is emotion and the third conviction you know I don't know if you call that enough that could be a good work now the next one like I said is that idea that you are the choice and this is actually a an underlying frame that you have in your head but this is actually going to come out through your voice so if you look at a guy say Anthony Robbins Whitney change yourself development there's something about the way that he's speaking or you could just feel this is the best guy it's just like I could look at another self-help teacher and maybe they'd be like a cool niche to look at maybe they'd be a little different but when Tony comes out he's the guy and there's there's an underlying frame that's there and when you look at that when you combine the dominance with good emotion with assuming that you're already in their head there's a conviction there there's something that comes across where the underlying frame in your voice is sharpest attack and it's just clear this is the guy to listen to and I would like you to watch even say the video is Tony beside Gary Vaynerchuk and you can see two different guys that are kind of like the guy yeah it is interesting to see what's going on there right because Gary fucking well believes he's a guy and Tony believes the guy and Tony was probably a little bit more cocky when he's younger but he's tried to grow in a humble and it's like as he's got older so he's he's kind of trying to be humble and then Gary's kind of just going for it but to a certain extent Gary's kind of dominating with his voice but then to another extent I think because Tony is actually a little more humble that people that are a little bit more refined can see that maybe Tony's actually you know he might have had a little bit more life in fact you're watching that they both have that sort of mellifluous quality or their voice that again you could tell they've got that conviction yeah so now going past that you also have things like cadence and this is where human beings we don't want to hear a monotone sound for a long period of time people zone out so as you're speaking you feel the different emotions and you produce that in your body and that's going to come through in your voice so that can be done with extensions like that's going to come through your voice oh and from real social dynamics it's Owen and Julian wrong oh look at that okay again that long Jewish sound you edit the in block like that right so in my body I feel the Jew and then oh like that and like that bang like spit like bang and you're speaking hey how are you doing I want to really connect deeply with you here maybe we go down in volume maybe we get aggressive so you're you're lining up different sounds with cadence and drawing it out or compressing it combining again with dominance the emotion the conviction the underlying frame and then you can actually assume like this is what I'm doing I feel into my body of when I'm getting borders hear myself talk and what I'll do is I actually kind of just entertain myself like what I'm like I'm going to entertain myself that they're like I'm kind of like yeah hey hey and what's happening here is like this really even feeds into humor if you want everybody to laugh like I've done it before I've been like all these improvised additional speeches and people are laughing the whole time just put yourself into a funny frame of mind like put on your funny glasses and just feel the humor of life if you want to get serious put on your serious glasses in your mind and to get serious if you want to be like just positive and chill just think to yourself about everything that you're grateful for and then you can share that and these are tools in your in your arsenal which essentially are used to have a controlling of groups to stimulate amiss compete stimulus and really just to connect to spiked emotions to get laughter whatever it is that you need you can use your voice for that I think learning to change the cadence learning to change the the toad the the pitch the tonality all of those tools in the vocal toolbox that you can use to create a kind of compelling pattern if you will compelling flow if you will were talking the girl those are great and but those are contingent upon the guy even being able to produce a quality tone in the first place and that's what I notice and we we talked about this in it you know in a previous video how so many of these guys when we see them at the event so when they come on to the the boot camps they're simply unable to project loud and and it's very straight at least loud enough to be heard or taken seriously for that matter and I you know it's it's very sad often times when I see these guys on the bootcamp and and they're going to the girls and the girls literally are not even looking at them they literally aren't even looking I can even give them some hilarious opener that I know everyone finds awesome it's field-tested to work I might go up and say this they're like dude it fucking ignore them like they're like they're like they're literally like a plant like they're like this tree like they're not even war they're not even warranty acknowledgement as human being and I was like what is going on here because you look at these guys and you realize we're not exceptionally huge we're not Tony Robbins when I some six foot five giant who could like oh holy boob out the boys yet we're still getting it done so I really wanted with this program to dig into the the science behind vocal production and what I found was that it's quite easy for guys to fix this now granted there are some social conditioning aspects to to people not being able to talk loud you know you've been taught ever since you were young it's rude right it's just it's rude to talk loud well you know what it's also kind of rude to talk so low that they can't hear you and sometimes it's more appropriate to speak to speak quietly so you can get people to like come in sometimes it's necessary to speak aloud but the point is you want to have the options right you want to have the option so what I found as I dug into this like I said will work for the professional vocal coach that they're doing for Oh for years you know dyed-in-the-wool professional and so I just went through this program where she taught me everything about it there's five main points okay number one is actually posture and alignment most people are walking through the world in a state of low-level stress and startled at all times right you know goes back in the day you'd want that in case like some predator came you be like this you can get the fuck out right or you could hide even be very still and they wouldn't see you so we don't have predators stalking us in the wild okay here we're gonna have like a coyote or two on the up in the hills here but aside from that ain't no predators up here but again you've got all these other issues on you know the bills are coming up this that and the next thing and then that those are the normal things now you would put you in a club now we put you in a nightclub and be massively over simulated map deliver simulated and not only that did these like me here will they do they think I'm sexually attractive and you go up some girl and you get a rejection you gets even more and then the next thing you know you're like so many of these students that I see whether they're simply walking there's kind of like shuffling through the club and it's this weird like super tense you're not going to for one you'd be able to have quality vocal production in that state and to again you're just not going to be in the state to draw her into anything that she wants to be around so with the Alexander Technique we learned ways to release these holding patterns and it's very simple and something you just engage with every day and you're immediately you're going to feel stronger literally you're going to your vocal production is going to be much clearer you're going to feel taller literally taller because your spine going to straighten out you're going to feel more confident etc etc so that's where it starts that is the foundation of vocal production is having a confident relaxed upright posture it's going to burn less energy etc etc so it has that has a myriad of effects it all starts from there so in the second step up built on that foundation is we called breath management no singers of course know that breath management is essential to to a good singing performance you know we're not singing but at the same time you want to know how the mechanics of the breath work you want to know how to conserve the breath and you want to think of it as like if postures of the foundation breath is the fuel right breath is the energy that must be expended in order to produce the tone right so then we get into actual tone production and in there we're going to want to examine and explore how the actual apparatus works from the diaphragm to the vocal folds epiglottis the palate the nasal cavities how all those working together in conjunction to produce a tone now furthermore we talked about how to find your pitch and that's an that's a thing two guys need to know what's their optimal pitches because once you find your optimal pitch then you can start to play around with and go up and down and start to you know that's the jumping-off point for having that sort of note that melodic element to your voice that makes it more compelling as opposed to just like flat line of emotion right so again we've got posture we've got smash alignment we have breath management tone production then we get into what's called resonance now resonance involves the position of your voice box in whether it's up or down on and so we've got a lot of exercises in there cue determine optimal laryngeal position as well as a lot of exercise to double to articulation because different vowels are producing different ways and again this all bloom I mean I thought I knew about voice and I did it's funny because we know about it from up from a pickup an interaction standpoint from the trench thing is this is like a whole other level that you're hitting into which is like that's why I'm so excited about this program yeah it's really help course to be fair by the way I'll probably always have vocal issues and then now because of this people be like thought you tell Japanese remember I'm not there's we just push it so hard speaking like all day every day running the business doing seminars etc etc but yeah if I can be gently it's like it's like yeah it's like you're watching this and probably like driving like a Toyota Corolla like five miles every day we're like driving like some dune buggy through the mud every day basically you know to use a little vocal analogy there but as a side note just saying that I just made a decision yeah I'm getting a fucking dune buggy I swear to god I don't know how to do money you not get ATVs okay well a second bar but it goes on it's like for offroad okay I don't know when a guy in a knobby tire okay but we need to have one of those Aarthi dunebuggy calm and videobloggers cruise around there so yeah we got a lot of our exercise for articulation and then finally get to what's called ring which is also known in musical circles as singers form is this what gives you that ability to project like if you heard an opera singer like Pavarotti or something right that guy he when he would sing he's not using any amplification he doesn't have a mic yet he can be heard in a giant amphitheater over and granddad are great acoustics in there but still he's singing over an entire Orchestra and like what enables these guys said to have that well it that's what that's a ring is so all five of these elements come together to create a nice solid tone that's also going to be healthy long term yeah that's really good and so just as just a conclude so get an attraction we have dominance okay hi hi hi we have the emotion hi hi hi okay there's a motion we have conviction hi hi okay like swallowing your words so to speak and beyond that I think the major one is like and this is what your technique gets at which is projection which essentially is most people are speaking in pitches to avoid being seen whereas in projection you're actually speaking freely and what that means is that there's a way of speaking to where it's clear that you're not afraid of being heard because you have status it's no different than you know if a guy sits like this versus like this right I mean this is a bit you know but she's mode you know like all that but somebody willing to take up space versus hiding they're doing the same of their voice or in their style and fashion like you know if you dress in such a way that you know will get attention it's the same thing as taking up space and it's the same thing that's using your voice so these different elements are coming together to generate and fuel attraction and that's why your voice is your major major weapon now like we said could we just review or the the techniques oh yeah yeah the big the big five that we talk about and we how about these exercises for that you can engage with daily our number one posture right that's the basis posture alignment okay number two breath management number three tone production number four resonance at number five arena you bring all those together and it's R it's very very powerful I mean honestly and this is no boast in your no exaggeration I believe that if you are having difficulty hooking consistently like that's your problem that's your big problem you just can't get past the hook I would say 80 percent of the time it's this it's vocal production its vocal projection that's preventing you from getting that hook it's very easy to learn this stuff because it's not some esoteric inner game stuff I mean there is that element to it but in terms of the sheer physical production it's pretty easy because you talk all the time anyway so the neural pathways are there and you disengage with these very simple exercises that you can engage with daily even on in like the car what waiting for the bus you know in spare moments and you're going to see rapid rapid improvement I mean I've been engaging with these things pretty much every day since I learned this stuff and I could feel the difference in how I stand I can feel the difference in how it just has more energy it's just easier to project yeah I think also that as far as inner game it's very very important study inner game as far as perspectives as far as your self-talk as far as where your awareness rests like being present but also realize that hard skills like this actually fuel your inner game like me knowing that when I walk into a room I can control energy that makes it ride on out to that just love yourself just be present hub good self-talk it's like no dude just go fucking talk and you're and you know it's going to go awesome so so they feed off of each other that's why I'm always saying 50% in our game 50% out our game they're a loop that's feed into each other so this year is something that actually feeds your inner game but also something that feeds off of inner game and it really it's just kind of like a nice entry point into helping yourself so again we've gone through some foundations here okay and funny enough like you know you had your technical aspect so I kind of just tried to like think off the dome of the attraction aspect so that's actually my first time teaching this much in depth and it will probably some seminars together what kind of even like the zero in aren't further and then Jeff will also be doing in much much deeper in his actual program but also you're going to even be seeing many of those techniques talked about in future videos as well you could enjoy here so you're going to see more don't panic it's going to be good there's something that I'm very very very excited for you learn more from your sequence sequence from some fucking the Pharaohs yeah I ran out of shit figured to the Pharaohs it's fine okay we're seeing figure I've got to say something it was like there was so many fucking funny things in my head it was like special I just sounds like I don't know iPod so you got me so but you see the general idea I hope that I hope that if there's something that you really got from this video it's like oh that's why hundreds of thousands of people watch their videos oh that's why these girls fuck them in a van oh I see the gap now I notice as I'm speaking to you right now I got a bit of dominance any motion and then conviction and projection and assuming familiarity with you and assuming that you want to hear it and being in your head and projecting to where you are okay so notice that you know the cadence the drawing out keeping it tight making it nice and tight speeding it up slowing it down connecting deeply I mean it's that heart that old aphorism really is true like they say you know the actual content of what you're saying is only 7% of communication the other 93% is this stuff mm-hmm you know so important so important why wouldn't you master it why wouldn't you master it especially if it's this easy to do so okay so what we have is dominant emotion conviction what do we want to do it kind of fuckit it so I think those are the kind of innovation I'd also go on projection I'd also say assumption of familiarity and I would say change in pitch okay so with it so basically all those exercises that we did before we were really digging into how to produce the tone now we want to learn how to manipulate it to get specific types of responses again you can't micromanage responses to you but in general certain types of communication are going to garner tend to garner a certain type of response so there's really two slip sides to the same coin okay so on the one side you've got kind of like the quote unquote inner game stuff which is what what do we talk about the very beginning the ability to recognize when society is having an undue influence on you when you're in that sort of protect the little me do I look cool and again you're in that protective intent and learning again install tools that will help you to sort of start to push that off when you see it happening that's the inner game of it what we were talking about before he showed up going through all those exercises that we did for like an hour basically is that that is the technical side so if you think of it like this it's like on this side you've got like Eckart Tolle right like the inner game like Eckhart Tolle's like I mean you have some queer little smile right that guy told Larry if you've ever seen him in person that guy's he's super fun he's like he's like a silent comedian or something it's fucking hilarious so then I'm so that's a car he's like you know inter games so then on the opposite who do you have who is the exact opposite of Eckart Tolle in the self-development community Anthony Robbins right Anthony Robbins like achieve destroy okay with you light well get your dreams yeah guy uh yeah so those two guys like the ones like inner game the ones he's also giving it's more like technical more like hands-on right practical stuff you can do so again you need to know how to physically actually produce the tone and then you've also got to start to deal with the blocks and stuff they're preventing you from actually projecting okay so you want to hit positive dominance that's the first one the next one you have to get is conviction the most guys have a massive lack of conviction in their voice it's very subtle to scare skulls kills you it fucking kills you this will destroy your whole life your life is being limited by this the lack of conviction your voice is destroying your entire life that's why drag guys up in front half the videos it's ruining them they're making less money they can meet girls they're not making the friends they want they're not getting the outcomes they want they can't pitch anything okay thanks for example at the very beginning when I came out here what was I talking about my contingency plans to defeat the team members of rst issue they turn evil or become brainwashed using a combination of sorcery vampire magic and nunchaku skills now again this is just nonsense but it's oddly compelling because like where the fuck is this guy going to go with this for one and then the variants again there's a lot more going on than just the toe impression so you've got to also take into consideration the tempo sometimes you can speed up something to slow it down inserting pauses for effect okay and more importantly than anything I'd say is burying the pitch because a lot of guys are just going der der der I had this kid recently and he was up it was here in Los Angeles it was actually on a bootcamp and we're out in Santa Monica somewhere and every time this kid would go up I mean the some people saying was okay but he was just so monotone that you could see them like initially he'd go up and I tell him to say something and like say some funny opener or something I'm like I feed him a line they go up the girls like ha ha ha ha ha and then he's like so the and you literally see their faces like initially like excited they're like and then after a couple minutes they're like oh oh okay I see what's going on here okay all right well hey you know I got a nice to meet you and then it just kept happening so I said I'm like look you need to I want you to go in to try to various the kind of the melody the pitch even if you're in like a business situation though too for that matter you're not trying to subtract some dude again really yeah your presentations got to be on point you got to have a good plan and all that but if you can't step to them and actually deliver this with conviction and charisma you might as well not even come out you know come out to play so again get in your head though when we're out there tonight it's not the content it's the vibe that she's attracted to right this is why I can go up there and say hi I'm my name my name is vampire Potter or whatever the fucking nonsense is like spring into my head honestly when we're out there I I do use a lot of kind of prefabricated um lines and stuff to move things forward you know but generally for the most the in-between stuff it's just like I'm shaking a magic 8-ball and I'm just like letting it bubble up I'm just letting it bubble up them like that that that that that now granted beyond that as we just said you need to be able to project that in a proper way modulate the voice correctly and beyond that there is a grammar to humor and storytelling this there is a skill set around storytelling and humor that you also need to kind of be aware of and work within those parameters to make it more punchy to know the timing etc etc etc and there's a whole again a whole host of information that we gives you on that the key here is that like half of my boot camp is guys just saying I can't believe that's all you did I can't believe that's all you said they can't but they but here's the keys they're unable to see the gap between themselves and what we're doing they're like but I said that yeah I didn't work why are you able to call that girl over from across the room why are you able to make out with that girl that you just met I'm doing that why doesn't it work so we're showing it to you now look we'll use your mic Luke now what we're going to do is we're going to bring guys the front and actually test the principles oh because I don't like it I don't like you when we learn some shit and then guys walk away they can't remember so who wants to come up and do a test alright get up here try yourself how you doing guys how you doing guys you do it how are you doing guys you do it how are you guys try it it came again okay show me the high one show me how are you doing guys show me do troll I do it guys show me down how are you doing Gus okay so he's almost got it and that there is a reflection of it's it's sort of like your body will resist those tones in order not to draw attention on you okay now show me okay show me - hi how you doing guys neutral how you doing guys show me the down how you doing guys how are you doing guys how are you doing guys okay you're now you're going low early go low on trail on it low trail low how are you doing guys how are you doing guys okay decent kill me now altering are you doing guys how are you doing guys hey how are you guys doing okay so he's getting it can you see that they actually have to go out of there come out of the comfort zone and stretch to produce the more dominant sounds and catch a nap okay Mike back to him tell me it's really positive and then show it all cranky kind of a lies down so show fought like right now I'd be stretching so I'm positive I show me show me positive hi guys hey guys the showcase now show me show me a bit not happy hey guys and show me like sad hey guys okay good okay show me conviction hey guys that was kind of weird one but for me show me conviction though hey guys I choose we'll do something a bit longer I'm really happy to be here that gives you a second to kind of ease into the conviction of addiction of it does I'm really happy to be here okay show more conviction like like imagine right now that you're some crazy fucking maniac running for president guys I'm really happy to be here show me right now guys I am really happy if you're ready presidency bro okay show me guys I'm really happy to be here stretch it out okay draw it out draw it out okay guys I'm really happy to be here okay guys okay guys I am really happy to be here he's not ready to be President okay really so happy in Kenya here where'd your emails where's your emails bro so how about that okay that's it okay more gestures to like just some Trump gestures as well this is a good one I find it big-league yet important okay be like guys let me tell you let me let me tell you no excuse me excuse me let me tell you let me tell you excuse me nobody nobody knows better than me nobody is happier to be here than I am okay believe me no bully excuse me believe me so here are the variables okay number one you got variables in volume you can talk slowly you can talk or low you talk high right so that's one so I want to see variables in volume okay I'm going to see variables in pitch in pitch pitch pitch pitch pitch up and down right so volume pitch okay tempo so sometimes I'll be like good evening my name is Jeff with real social dynamics and today I'd like to talk to you about a variety of things okay so again I start up quickly and then it pause and then draw it out so you got again volume you got pitch you got tempo you got pauses okay and then you've also got level just general level of emotions of conviction so let's like play around with all three of those or four of those five of those we're able to show me deep and angry hi there hi there there you go how are you doing how are you doing okay there's some nice change there you got to give me a hand with that  now okay so that was fuckin awesome by the way so go what's up go what's up what's up what's up you know we were dressing now what what's up what's up what's up what's up what's up with you okay they don't lower like like like just a complete fucking degenerate saw what's up doc what's up no now go now go get lit yes okay louder though louder yeah lit gets it say to the guys in the back get lit okay so look at the dirt so get me saw get it sup your lit do that again you just go get it son so get lit lit okay now that I like it so just a denim I'm extremely happy to be here today I'm extremely happy to be here today don't like your stone or something so here on valium or something like vicodin again more enthusiasm I think we need more enthusiasm just go okay let's over exaggerate it go hey hey hey I mean oh no that's so wrong okay just go hey come on he just died you see this guy right there yeah see that guy right there pulling his arm talk to him over exaggerate it like over exaggerate the aggression over exaggerate you're not going to save this place we're going to stretch you because remember remember when you're like okay if you're do you ever do martial arts or anything like that if you don't want to punch at you want to plug through right so again don't talk here talk to that guy that guy right there hey how are you guys doing today okay just go hey hey louder hey hey you're here okay hold on do you hear how when he does that it starts to get hoarse yeah indeed continues to do that over the course of it four hours in a club you're just going to be wrecked in the morning right so again remember the techniques use your breath management again that's where the power comes from okay okay and then you're going to bounce that shit you're a bounce that shit off the pallet and then squeeze that fucking stinker right in the esophagus to be like hey hey hey hey better hey better hey make it louder more power okay good that's good now I'm so happy to be here right now I am so happy to be here right now it's pretty good actually yeah joke don't you yeah okay so let's do a quickie little breakdown what happened there that would have time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the set that's that set 80% of the time this is the problem hey freeze motherfucker a good evening he doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him so by the find function she this is the roof of the mouth right here right yes smelling something nice touching shoulders ah that's the touchdown right they're not just being loud but being clear so this right sometimes people will say what they heard you they heard the noise  good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps with cheese and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding that was good so uncomfortable you look different ah nice clenching it here in order to yeah and that's what we don't want ok this we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow they're swollen this is probably what my boss's cords look like Island City animated anytime what are you porky talking about oh I'm like literally cringing she was like my voice tone was like oh like average above average but yours is like Asian [Music] yes don't do this no connect sit down shut up blah blah the other begins down you're dumb you're dumb yeah yeah you're dumb your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a to MIT where we're telling stories you want to be more excited or you need to be more like calm and collected and that will change often dynamically during the interaction itself it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn the stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice you're going to be able to go out and take your finger like this and push it push it and then and that weird and so weirdest thing when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I truly believe that it's only a matter of time until they like now Tara bitching about my family gave me a huge awareness of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicality behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling in junior selanne personal go father like hello but all in all I write that you know it's a little act and that's that's mostly quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game concept there's like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve we're so so so long [Music] you  you  Oh  [Music] you,KK2wsYn4IU0
basic principles are going to apply you you go up you talk you smile you keep talking okay you communicate as a man to woman you approach you communicate as a man to woman as opposed to a friend to a friend and you begin physical escalation of course when it comes time to the crucial part which is the what the make-out when you you guys want to make out is that's when you put your mouth you take your face and you put it like by their face like real close and you put your mouth on their mouth and you can you like move your mouth around kind of and if you want to kind of take it to the further level the advance you can actually place your tongue inside their mouth and like kind of intertwine it so and you kind of continue to do that so a lot of newbies in here so I'm just keeping it very basic uh today I'm girl you like the hottest chick I ever seen my fucking life anyway that now the understand when you're dropping statements of intent or you're doing physical escalation there's something that this is very important a very important distinction that a lot of newer guys aren't really they don't get okay say I tell a new guy on bootcamp I'll tell them to to perform a physical escalation move like let's just take for example that that finger interlacing they might say well Jeff what do I say when I do this what do I say when I do this like you say nothing okay much in the same way that you probably would not say to the girl when you're about to have sex and now I am placing my penis inside of your vagina like you probably wouldn't say that right you might I might just cuz I think it's funny but um but but but you probably don't say that so in much in that same way you wouldn't be like and now I am placing the finger on the thing like I said the most the most I'll say is I can say well grab hands like what's mumbled gibberish I guess it's supposed to sound like let me see or something ooh yeah cool so anyway death and that but the verbals keep flowing okay for those of you who have an in a bit like you need to kind of develop what we call a waffle alright what pimps call the the million dollar mouthpiece and that's that ability to just just talk talk talk talk talk talk talk and keep talking now many people have an inability to do this how many guys in here have suffered at one point or another from the I run out of things to say syndrome okay now let's let's let's look at the root cause of that okay what is the root cause of I ran out of things to say thinking thinking about what sex why why would you run out things to say because you care what she thinks about what you're saying okay think about it now I said to a you know I'll tell students on program when you're with your close friends do you run out of things to say and I had a student who's like I don't have any close friends okay well well then um but no when you're like with your close friends you can just banter endlessly because you do not give a fuck what they think you don't care they've already accepted you they're your friends hence you can be unstyled you can flow freely that freedom from outcome that's that sort of criteria for success is independent of the girl's reaction and that's well first and foremost because you're never going to be able to eliminate the element of randomness okay fuckin nerds don't want to hear this shit they want to hear oh I do the special technique that caused me to get all girl alright in fact I do have the special technique in fact it's pretty I don't know I should even tell you guys this cuz this shit is like the top-secret shit you guys know Julian now this is like crazier than the drama this is even crazier you guys want magic pill okay this is it so this I'm going to tell you right now so this is pretty ol into these guys in this room there is a way to avoid getting rejected 100% of the time don't approach don't go out don't talk to girls you'll never get rejected fucking fantastic okay there's not a guy on this planet that every girl likes alright now it's always good people say oh isn't this the numbers game it always was the numbers game okay however in learning to play the game we can stack those odds significantly in our favor certainly far far more in our favor than the average douchebag in the populate in the gen-pop do you guys know what man to women communication looks like yes you're like I may have seen it once or twice uh yeah I mean it's honestly a lot of guys they hear this and they think that it's it's kind of this very aggressive thing it's really not it's quite subtle in fact there's an element of aggression to it but it's more it's more on the level of sub communication so again and this is in you guys want practical stuff this is a very practical thing I see this on bootcamp every single weekend every single weekend okay the guys they simply don't get in front of the girl in fact can you stand up for a moment so I can demonstrate for this I'm not gonna do anything weird just it's okay at least not that weird so so okay so I'll see this now they'll go up now here's here's one thing that they'll do they'll do this hey like girls are talking here and they'll be like hey so dude like I swear to God how fucking creepy does this look and they'll do this they will do and the girl won't looking they do not command attention I've seen shit where the girls the guys talking at the girl she's not even looking at him and he's continuing to blather his River like she's not even looking at him okay the girl look at me excuse me hey excuse me excuse me I'm trying to talk to you yes thank you and continue like that but these guys will be like this or frequently they'll be like this more often you know this is an extreme example this like creeper mode shit but but but more frequently they'll kind of be like this okay to be like yeah so do did you do yeah huh cool right yeah right i'ma get in front of them in fact I was screaming at this dude last weekend in Calgary I'm like kid in front of them and he like he's like okay and he do it again and I'm like do you understand what the word front means do you know what front means you're fucking like a midget is it like going apoplectic about have an aneurysm it means this hi how are you standing directly in front proximity not necessarily like that you've got to calibrate it a lot of guys here like beast mode they hear this beast mode and they think it's like you're like some rabid dog on the end of a chain looks like foaming and like spraying foam interface or something but you know it's kind of like it's like this at least you're up front you're like this like hey what's up this makes you cool so anyway my name is Jeff I really enjoy the Twilight film series there's a new one coming out it's called what it's called Breaking Dawn or so it broke I'd love for you to accompany me to it you appear quite fashionable this evening deadener de der der der der der der kind of a rhythmic in and out and then bam bam bam maybe maybe go a bit like this there's a rhythmic aspect to it okay but you have to gauge that by her her comfort level which happens through a process of direct emotional stimulation alright I can get into that at length but thank you very much but you see the difference you get the fuck in front of them and it's the eye contact it's the way you look at them as posed like this hey there's a lilting vocal tonality we're like little sup at the end it's like a yeah blood Twilight yeah cut my own hair while I'm drunk derp right like I play the kazoo I studied that conservatory I went to Juilliard Murch right so and then it's and then I start dropping in statements of intent and then I dig in the physical escalation that's what constitutes man to woman I want you to view every interaction we have with girls out there wherever it is through the following lens again was I a trying to weasel my way into their party right like they're out there having fun and then this like guy comes up like excuse me ladies may I join the fun and they're like yay and then they're like God another fucking loser we have to like politely humor until he leaves okay or are you already having fun and then you're just bringing that that's why you'll see if you see us in the club you know instructors or you know any guy who's who's good frequently they will be bopping around they'll be doing shit like there because they're not going to be standing up against the wall like leering like doing King Lear like fucking holding the drink up against the chest like methodically value scanning the room okay at bear MIT or or even worse just got like what I see what I see more frequently sometimes I'll be on bootcamp we'll have like three guys on bootcamp Oh coach these guys I'll be alright where's bill I find bill low and behold he's kind of just holding a drink like staring into the middle distance everyone's like partying in shade having a good time and he's like like oh fuck I'm like - what are you doing I do not want to come upon you and I don't want to come upon you in five and five and five you staring into the middle distance there's an old Tony Robinson motion creates emotion so you want to prime your physiology to approach okay so a bare minimum I'll be doing this tap in my toe to the beat ins its moons right maybe a little this okay more likely I'll be doing some kind of fucking weird fucking like like Gangnam style shit like screaming gibberish like whoa uh-huh I make very musical I'll be yelling shit throwing shit around busting out the  I could just do that for like hours I get literally so what this does is it allows me to to bring that party to bring the party so when I go up they're not like oh here's another energy leech that we are going to have to you know float his state up to our level he's already at our level or he's above so he's just adding to the fun you got understand when people go out to the club when the vast majority of people go out to the club they're there to relax really honestly it'll take me like two or three approaches to get into that zone again at the beginning of the night I don't want to do it all right but I think you really need two or three hard fucking blowouts at the beginning the night to like align yourself I'll see myself making the various mistakes okay didn't talk loud enough qualify myself expected them to contribute too early okay and it's kind of like that it's like it like wakes your ass up it's like it's like blue good morning I'm awake and then I go it's like a remembering that you're awesome  you,KKiJE3hiWKw

hey hey what's up this is jeff with real social dynamics and i'm here in san francisco announcing what i quite frankly consider to be the best work I've ever done in the company and I'm of course talking about the revamped Jeffie hot seat transformational experience now let me give a little context here I've been running programs for the rsd for literally thirteen and a half years almost every single weekend during that time and of course during that time I've also been going out myself so ultimately what we're talking about here is tens of thousands of hours of pickup training now I don't even necessarily think I'm the most talented guy to stuff but when you've done it for that long and when for the more you've been teaching people to do it for that long well you're inevitably going to end up with countless shortcuts insights epiphanies and you know nuanced understandings of this stuff that there's absolutely no way that you be able to get aside from actually putting that time in now maybe you know a lot about RSD maybe you just know a little bit but we've taught programs in over 65 countries and 175 cities around the globe and we've taught thousands upon thousands of people face to face our live events and of course millions of people see our videos on YouTube and so forth and to this day I constantly am getting emails texts and even having people come up to me on the street and in the club's telling me about like all the crazy successes they've had as a result of what they learn from RSD you know they said oh I hooked up with a bunch of girls or I got this amazing girlfriend and I've even had a couple guys be like yo I'm getting married to this amazing woman I met her it's all thanks to you you guys changed my life right and I got to say every time it happens it it does bring a manly tear to my eye you know and I'm not lying here that's why I continue to do this you know despite all the ups and downs of the hardships all the travel and everything that's why I continue to do this you know I know I come across a little bit brusque at times in my online persona but I want you to understand that ultimately I am extremely appreciative and grateful to actually be in a position to bring this material to you so thank you now having said that I'd like you to imagine that instead of having to work on this area constantly for 13 years you could instead come to an event and just have it downloaded into your brain in a single day okay imagine I took my best videos and I'm not talking about the most insane stuff where I pulled off some crazy pickup or anything like that but what I'm talking about is the actually the most impactful and in educational videos the ones that are going to show you the most advanced nuances they're in plain sight before you okay furthermore these aren't just little snippets like you see on our YouTube you know these little infield snippets frankly those short clips you see on our YouTube channels they're kind of the garbage clips if you will like the cutting room floor stuff okay we reserved the best stuff for the hotseat program and what we're talking about here is full videos from open to close in high-definition blast it up on a giant movie screen so imagine that now imagine that furthermore you've got me there in front of you breaking these videos down and answering all your questions as they pop up okay again you've got a 15 year veteran of the game and you could pick my brain right there in real-time also I'm not just kind of like riffing and improvising like you might see on a free tour or at a random YouTube video but what I'm doing is I'm actually giving you the full proper RSD teachings I think it's kind of crazy a lot of guys watch our videos on YouTube and they and they don't even realize that we actually have a full paid course with a standard curriculum and that curriculum has evolved over the years to become what we feel is the most impactful and clear presentation of the material okay so now on top of all this we've also added the most intense interactive exercises that you've ever done and you know if you take your time to schlep your ass to the actual live event we're going to respect that by leveraging that live loop dynamic to absolutely just blow the lid off the internal issues that are holding you back now insofar as I'm aware there's literally never been anything like this in the history of civilization you know like the technology just wasn't there so we've got the videos which give you this like crystal-clear view of a high-level pick up what that what that actually is but beyond that you're not just passively watching them so what we do with the exercises is we start to get you thinking about different social dynamics and we kind of play with them almost kind of like a Rubik's Cube right like what happens if we tweak this or what happens if we tweak that and then we examine it through the exercises and what I was a happening becomes like a complete madhouse in the room it's it's almost in a way kind of like a like a hallucinogenic drug trip it's a very very intense experience and it's designed to sort of burn away the weakness to to force you to confront your fears and again reveal subtle nuances of social dynamics that you never you never really get or realize unless you attended this in person so what we do is we give you the experience of being under intense social pressure but at the same time we also give you tools to not only make you able to endure it but also making able to push back and become truly free truly expansive and at the cause of things in your life not the effect so you'll watch the in field videos and you might ask okay how is Jeff able to you know free-associate and beyond stifled right how do I keep a strong frame how do I resist social pressure how do i influence my environment etc etcetera etcetera now it's funny because a lot of times guys don't understand why I'm getting results when they don't because they watch the stuff and they're like well you know he's really not doing anything that differently than what I'm doing you know in a lot of cases it just looks like I'm going up and saying hi it's because I not only understand the techniques and tactics but I'm also hitting that sort of sweet spot that comes from having internalized the principles okay ultimately this is about principles not about the techniques themselves any technique that you could possibly learn falls under the umbrella of one principle or another and if you understand that principle you would oftentimes arrive at the tactic of your own accord without even like realizing it right so at this event what we're going to do is catalyze change we're going to take it from watching the videos and you know understanding intellectually the tactics you see and what we're going to do is want to push you to do it yourselves so you see the videos and you theoretically understand what's going on but it's like learning about math or something like I want to say I want to teach you about the quadratic equation so I ride it up on the board and I explain what it is and you understand intellectually but then what I do is I hand out a worksheet with a bunch of problems on it I'm like okay go through these problems and solve for X so again you're going to see the videos and then after that we're going to get you to do the equations yourselves and by the end of it you're just going to be sweating you're going to be absolutely exhausted at the end I always M personally at least I know that so the point is if you want to create change that's going to take exertion now obviously you're not gonna walk out of the events like immediately transforms decades of social conditioning fixed and you transformed into iceberg slim the pimp from beyond history you know that's not realistic but what we're going to do is we're going to plant the seeds at the event and then over the next subsequent weeks you go out and practice and then you go into an upward spiral and I really want you to views this as like the change the cutting point where you decided to change and by doing this you'll know exactly how to enact the principles and techniques that you see okay even if you don't remember every single little tactic from the the event itself you'll still be able to go out and execute right how to free flow how to use your voice how to use humor how to control the frame and more importantly go out and do it that very night okay look there's no denying you're influenced and shaped by society okay it's pushing you into a box now let me ask you this have you ever had the thought that perhaps you are not even you now what I mean by that is what you think of as your personality is in fact simply a collection of various influences accrued over the years as well as you know biological imperatives so what we're trying to do here is get you to the root of yourself okay we want to get you at the cause not the effect where you're the cue ball in the billiards game not the colored balls getting knocked around and to do that we've got to scramble the patterns first I'm keenly aware of how social pressures are limiting me and furthermore I know how to break them off when it happens now for me I've done that over a period of many years but what we're going to do is we're going to use the group environment at the live events to actually crack those patterns off okay now furthermore I've gone above and beyond here and I've created my own Jeffy centric exercises at the event now a lot of times at these events and just in general people come up to me and they say Jeff I love your stuff I love your game and it seems like you're you're exceptionally good at telling stories you're really good at like you know humor being humorous and set and you've got a you know a bit of verbal wit about you how do I get that so what I did is I dug down and I developed a variety of exercises that are designed to teach you how to be a good storyteller that are designed to help you cultivate verbal wit that are designed to get you thinking in ways where you can be humorous on the fly when you're interacting with girls and just have them absolutely love it check it out let's say I want to tell a story about taking out the trash so this actually happened the other week I came back from the club and it was a Thursday night and Friday morning is trash pickup in my neighborhood so I open up the garage door and I take out the rubbish bin boom I take out the recycling bin boom and then I live in San Francisco so you were I know if you knew this but you probably here - I'd imagine you're legally obligated to compost as well so I got to drag a fucking third bin out so I dragged out the green bin boom they're all lined up close the garage door look what I have done I saw it was good and that is how I took out the motherfucking trash y'all okay now look it's a stupid story about something dumb a chore that took me fifteen seconds to complete yet it's oddly compelling why not only because of the color I put on it the enthusiasm which I tell it sometimes I'll interject pauses for effect sometimes I'll change the tempo of my voice the volume of my voice facial expressions hand expressions etc so again when you're telling a story and a lot of people say well Jeff how do I become a good storyteller well it's adding that enthusiasm to it so people are compelled by remember what's number of a rule pickup whatever you feel they feel to make sure the narratives like compelling and watching people remember part of it is seeing when people are getting bored with your bullshit do you understand so if I'm telling like a law wit story and I see people kind of like you know looking at starting to look at their phone or something like that I will cut to the chase right quick because part of its being empathetic right that's a part of being a good storyteller communicate with people so it's narrative its color emotion all these little things are what go into actually making compelling furthermore again removing or I guess divorcing the emotion from the actual content of the story itself so now what we're going to do I want you guys to get into like groups of fours just describe your commute here today okay and I want to be like a one to two minute story just like that now here's the twist at any point other guys that are listening can tag you and they can ask for either more emotion they can ask for more color or they can ask for more narrative meaning again what's narrative described more action describe more environment or bring more emotional punch to it if they feel you're not hitting it on one of those levels okay all right what kind of car do you drive she's driving a Volkswagen was like an uber right listen to videos  during this part of the big talk louder big growl road your vibe is what the girl enjoys not the content so when you divorce the content from the emotion your entitlement comes in line because you don't feel like you're wasting your time make sense you got to give yourself permission to be kind of silly essentially and then of course know how to learn how to like again tell a story in a compelling way etc etc so  cultivating that ability to tell a story to have it be captivating to have humor and wit to come up with funny stuff on the fly is that a skill back in the day Tyler was not funny at all you know what he was like it was like fucking dad jokes so then what happened was Tyler and I've taken these two I've taken a variety of improv comedy workshops and stand-up now when I took the stand up I was the best guy in the class by like a large and obvious margin but then when I took the improv my fucking sucked because it's like a different thing you know what I mean stand-up teaches how to be up there how to structure things so there punchy how to have good rhythm timing stuff like that but improv you're on your feet and let's face it that's probably more like what you're going to be encountering when you're out there talking to a girl so when Tyler he went to like the big I figured what it's called but the one in LA like the the basically the UCB exactly UCB theatre and he took all their levels of improv and now he's actually funny I'm still funnier but he's actually funny you know but he's actually fucking funny now and you can see a market improvement so yes this is a skill that you can in fact cultivate we can do a couple little exercises here right now to kind of get into that so these are some classic ones and these are kind of kind of train you to think on your feet and come up with fucking shit with witty shit and by the way like I said it's not necessarily going to make the girl attracted to you but it can and it can help that old Voltaire quote I don't know if this a lot of people are treated this to Voltaire I don't know if it's actually true but what did he say you know give me ten minutes to talk away my ugly face and I can bang the queen of pants so again there is value to this so what we're going to do let's get into the groups and we're going to do two different exercises and the first one is called sex with me is like so okay I like this because it's taking things sexual and it's also making you be creative so what's going to happen is you're going to take turns and then one guy's just going to say something he'll be like he'll be he'll be like chocolate milk and then the us the others have to come up with the best one for sex with me is like chocolate milk because it's creamy and black okay or so or whatever or whatever you know so so again let's just do this one for a couple minutes and then we're going to take it further okay so again yeah we're gonna take it further so get out and we'll do sex with me is like one person comes up with an idea and then it's open season for the other three to come up with the best okay so you can be like turtle sex with me like turtles because it's really slow and I don't conversant you know whatever or whatever you know so okay so we'll just pop in here so uh okay so let's start let's do uh section me is like a Ford Focus top there Wow because because my black helmet because I'm because of my black phallic helmet what doesn't even make sense  do you feel how that like forces you to start to think in creative ways you know what I mean so when you're in there with a girl you can just spin shit that she says a lot of what I do in my vibing I just free associate like I take some shit that she says and then I spin some weird fucking shit that makes little or no sense out of it and then take it sexual so that's why I like that game now what we're going to do we're gonna take it a little further and it's a little more in-depth rather than just throw out a word and associate with it what we're going to do this one's called the good the bad and the ugly so one guy and you're gonna take turns one guy is going to be the guy that has a problem or a situation that he needs advice about okay so you could be like yeah my wife's having an affair what's the what should I do okay then you're going to go and the other three guys again there's groups of four so then the guy immediately to your left is going to give you good advice the guy next is going to give bad advice and the guy next is going to give the literal worst fucking advice you could give in the world okay okay what's your what's your scenario  okay food poisoning  what is it you should okay here's what you should do first you should write a scathing yelp review indicating how disappoint you were then gather the following materials you're going to need a bottle you're going to need some gasoline you're going to need a rag and you put the rag in the bottle you're to set on fire throw it through the fucking restaurant so you're going to burn the restaurant down call the cops on yourself and then when they come to arrest you cut your own gig on there you go all right so you're next so okay  these are just little things that are designed to kind of get you thinking creatively outside the box and absurd you know because here's one of the biggest the most concise descriptions of game that I've heard recently and this is from a student of mine who one of my best you know most proud proud of this guy like he was a kid he had had sex with five girls before the boot camp in the year after he slept with ninety two girls and I told him move to Vegas because he had like his little small town I'm like move out of that bullshit mood to Vegas get a job in the industry go out every night for a year and you'll never have to think about this bullshit ever again he's like and then he calls me like a month later he's like emails me is like I did it I quit my fucking job I'm like oh no like but then I see him later in like a year later at the summit I'm like how's it been going he's like I'll dude pretty good he's like check it out at my company gritty things like 92 and it's it's like stripper hottie go-go dancer bartender like not it's not like hover hand either it's like his face bother pussy and shit my god I'm like holy shit I'm like that the student has become the pastor holy fuck take me out with you please like his name he goes by danger and he taught me this this is one of my favorite new openers because we were hanging out the other week his opener now as he goes up goes good evening my name is Satan I'm a professional mermaid that's the opener my name is Satan I'm a professional mermaid okay so the thing is I said like why do you think that that's so good it's like everyone's fucking bored just give them something different and then make it easy for them to suck your dick I was like wow that's like the most concise description of game I've heard in a while everyone's bored give him something different and then make it easy for them to suck your dick so again just start thinking outside the box light light shit doesn't need to make so much sense have fun with it play around they get a little absurd you know get a little absurd you can always dial it back so no matter what level you're at this program has something for you if you're a newbie you're going to get a crystal clear understanding of what pickup actually is and furthermore you're going to see that it's fun so you want to go out and do it more and more you know if you're intermediate you'll see you know I'm not really doing anything that you couldn't do right now and in fact you probably are doing a lot of the things that I am but just not as consistently so what we want to do is get you to that place of consistency now if you're advanced you know you're gonna have the same shock as the new guy obviously you've seen it all before pickups pickup but what you are going to see are the most detailed nuances of social dynamics you could get anywhere and furthermore you're going to reaffirm and cement things that are absolutely going to change your life so personally myself and Tyler we had to hunt and peck in the dark back in the day to learn this stuff you know there was no infield footage back then it was just where on Usenet and these like walls of text and you had a kind of suss out for yourself who was full of shit knew wasn't you know you'd be like Oh mr. sex 1 2 3 seems pretty good I guess I'll try his stuff and you go out and try it maybe it worked maybe it didn't and we learned that through a process of trial and error so that's why we made these programs to be entirely honest almost kind of as a love letter to our past selves like this hot seat program is the program that I wish I had when I was coming up now look could you learn this yourself could you go out and learn this stuff by yourself absolutely I'm living proof of that but at the same time you could also walk from LA to New York City or you could take a bicycle or you could take a car or you could take a private jet so don't be arrogant about your time you want to learn this stuff from professionals not from like your brother-in-law ok look like I said before I want to give back what I've learned but the other half of the equation is you so you got to empower yourself and that comes from education and if we can do it then you can do it and it's reproducible okay this isn't luck it's not magic it's reproducible if one man can do it another can and quite frankly this hot seat program is the quickest vehicle by which to do this so look man if you know RSD and you know me we don't make hits we make classics so every time you put something out we want to put something out that years from now people are going to be talking about it you know as that's the day that's the program that changed their life literally alright this is not a program for people who take the shit passively heard a blurs or just want to sit back on the sidelines and watch stuff okay people who want to like watch stuff and be the spectator they probably think this is stupid right they've actually watched us doing these exercises and it would like trigger insecurities in them and be like that's stupid I don't fucking need that even though at the same time if you take a look at their life it's fucking stagnating and it's just staying exactly the same so again just to review we've got hidden camera footage okay the best of the best the most eye-opening of the most eye-opening all the secrets revealed but then from there we're going into the most subtle social dynamics exhibited to you and the power of a live event where you just go fucking crazy and we work together with the people of course who want to go fucking crazy so what's happening here is you've basically got a full-scale event where you can ask questions you can see exactly how success with women social dynamics and of course the self developments of that are done but then you also get to do it right then and there so this is a course that's not only going to completely transform your results with women I mean shit that's going to be basically an afterthought but you know the icing on the cake if you will but furthermore this is actually a course that's going to transform the social results that you get in life okay you know I say this without a hint of irony your life will never be the same again okay the fundamental focus of this course is to take you to a place where you are at the cause of things in your life you're not going to be a piece of driftwood getting knocked around in an ocean in the rapids okay you are the swimmer you're in full control of your life so let me ask you this and I want you to answer this right now do you want to wake up a year from now and feel that you're in the same place you are right now or do you want to wake up a year from now and you know experience all the power that came from making a slight orientation change and staying on that path as opposed to staying on this path again it doesn't look like much but down the line it's dramatic okay and think of this winners will do the most productive thing in any given situation losers almost never do so if you want to attend this event go to Jeffie have c-calm okay don't waste any more time on this if you wait till later you might you know get caught up with other stuff and you forget your life continues to go by you're doing the same stuff you've always done you're getting the same results you've always gotten you're just kind of stuck in this holding pattern okay and instead you'll be making massive changes and catalyzing major improvements in your life okay so look as I've said before I'm extremely proud of this event I'm very very excited to be bringing this on tour and most of all I'm excited to meet you at the Jaypee hotseat transformational experience,KSgNgMK9bUE
proverbial boy here and today we're gonna get to some black magic fuckery okay now these days I know that our SD we're all about the the positivity okay we're all about the high vibrational energy but back in the day we were like bitter devious little nerds who were essentially learning to subvert to the social order and you know with these tactics that we sort of reveled in often we're kind of angled at getting revenge on the jocks that used to get the girls back in high school and in our minds we were on some kind of like Sith Lord type of shit nowadays obviously we're on the path of goodness and light however let me assure you that we still retain all of that arcane dark knowledge and I'm very very aware that there is a certain subset of the fans who absolutely love that shit so today what I'm gonna do I'm gonna take it back how far we going back way back and I'm going to talk about boyfriend destroying tactics [Music] before we delve into that however let me just take a quick minute to remind you to LIKE and subscribe to this channel smash those buttons down below to keep receiving these sacred texts every single week so anyway like I said back in the day we developed all kinds of these devious tactics okay including how to do so-called a Hmong battles where you essentially tool the guy out of the set nowadays we'd probably just ignore the guy because giving these guys any sort of attention and potentially gives them a sort of like hand hold or a foot hole to foot in the door to get in so like I said now we'd probably just ignore but again we do know how to do it likewise back in the day we would take Glee in stealing girls from their boyfriends okay nowadays I you know I'd most likely just find an actually available girl just to avoid all that drama but again we still know how to do it so today as a little blast of the pass allow me to present our potent boyfriend destroying material and all of its evil glory so like I said back in the day I used all of this stuff and I saw it worked very effectively from what myself and four friends who asked me to like destroyed the boyfriend on chicks that they wanted to get with as well and this works on all form of commitments from you know marriage engaged boyfriend etc any essentially any guy she's attached to and this stuff is more geared towards prompting an actual breakup okay so if you're just trying to like make yourself sexually available to a committed girl who would you know sense that you sense that would want you regardless well this stuff is hardly necessary but having said that let's get into it so a few things to remember here number one when boyfriend destroying you're essentially walking a tightrope between evoking too many bad feelings and having them essentially anchored to you in the mind of the girl you do want the girl to dump the guy but essentially your end goal is to hook up with her not break her up with the boyfriend for some other dude to enjoy okay so that's number one number two it's preferable that and this is very very important it's probably you don't appear as though you want her to dump the boyfriend okay rather make the idea appear to be something that she came up with of her own accord kind of like a you know Socratic method if you will now number three while doing this you must direct the conversation to make her prompt you to tell her how you would treat a woman okay so make her kind of work it out of you because you know she's kind of worked up over this situation and she wants to know if she's gonna get a fair deal or not if she were to go with you next you must refrain and this is kind of the key thrust here you must reframe all behavior on the boyfriends part to appear like insecure nice guy behavior even behavior that like players would use on girls such as like not agreeing to a relationship it must be reframed as being nice guy behavior okay like for example someone who's like too afraid to be decisive and go for what they really want you know little fray of the loser emotionally or something like that right so all behavior can be reframed now by making the guy look like a nice guy you're essentially making him the most sexually unappealing guy conceivable and once you've done this there's essentially nothing that this guy's gonna be able to do to get back in her good books okay you put him in this predicament where literally anything that he does will be interpreted by her as being insecure so for example if he's too distant and let's say then he wants to make up for it by buying her flowers well guess what he's insecure okay if he's too needy and he makes up for it by getting a little bit like you know putting a little distance between he's insecure okay so what you're trying to do is defuse defuse his like outer glossy shell and give the girl a window into his inner working so that he no longer appears mysterious in any way at all okay you make her understand him so well that she likes him more as a person but no longer has any sexual desire for him at all so another thing to remember here is that if the relationship was that good in the first place she would not be out with you okay so this is obvious and really needs no comment all you need to do is tell her how you treat women making it the way that she would like to be treated so you got to elicit her values okay and this is her to make this is to make her realize that you are the one subconsciously so now having said that let's get into some of the tactics so what you're looking to do here is again tear the guy down to be a nice guy while making it look like you're actually sticking up for him okay so your goal is to make him like you know one of those guys that a girl would you know go out on a date with like like is a person then feel bad for saying let's just be friends at the end of the night so how do you do that well almost invariably relationships are gonna have certain problems almost invariably and these are some of these just some of them off the top my head jealousy okay little jealousy based spats and this is a key one meatiness failure to commit or being too distant abusive behavior whether it's physical physically abuse physical abuse mental or emotional views psychological withdrawal sort of to gain certainty in the relationship right in other words what I'm talking about here is like sometimes in relationships the guy will like withdraw a little bit just to see how the girl reacts to see if the other person will pursue them and people do this periodically to kind of reassure themselves that the relationship is solid and this is just basic dime-store psychology here and very very easily observable and pretty much any relationship another one being irresponsible okay like for example if they live together he's not doing his share of like the household chores or paying the rent or anything like that not being assertive enough in bed this is a very fucking common one or conversely being in like freaky sex shit like he's into like weird being BDSM shit or like some kind of kinky stuff that the girl might think is too far out another one would be like getting angry or maybe frustrated when he initiates sex and she's like tired or not in the mood this is also a very very key one being too predictable okay not passionate etc etc so there are some like very basic ones so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna break these down to now show how I would actually reframe these you know complaints in a way that appears that I'm actually sticking up for the boyfriend but I'm inadvertently destroying his ass okay so mind you this is not like the sum total of all the routines but simply the raw fuel that you are employing while you're using standard tactics okay now remember you may not actually want to start escalating the the sexual state with a girl until she's convinced that the guy is lame as fuck okay otherwise she might potentially realize that you're actually trying to pull one over on her so again if you're talking shit like or you're like sticking up to the web you know he's a great guy it just sounds like he's insecure or whatever and then all of a sudden right then you start to let go for the make-out again she might realize that you know you're trying to you're trying to pull the wool over our eyes and fuck the guy over now again this is not a hard and fast rule but it's definitely something to be considered based on your evaluation of the circumstance as it unfolds okay so let's just take jealousy for example if I listen from the girl that she feels the guy's jealous I'll say something like you know well you just gotta understand you know the this guy really appreciates you because let's face it you're probably the best girl he's ever got with or probably the best girl he ever will get I know that you care about this guy but there's just a certain equilibrium where you know if you've essentially done this guy a favor by being with him you know he's not equipped to handle it okay again like I said he's knows he's never gonna get a girl like you again so he's constantly frustrated he's constantly panic that you're gonna leave and it's just not his fault okay now if he is a needy guy I'd be like yeah you just gotta understand you know for this guy you're his entire world you know he cares about you so much that literally everything else in the world is meaningless to him okay you're like to his only source of pleasure and without you he knows that he's essentially nothing I mean shit can you blame him right I mean he doesn't have anything else going for him so for him he needs you it's just saying this shit it just sounds so evil as I'm saying it okay what's the next one failure to come in okay he just won't commit to the girls like hey look it's just it's not that this guy doesn't love you you know he does it's just that deep down he's got the fear that you're too good for him you know and one day you're gonna realize it and you know it's gonna be like you know you just have to dump him and then he'll be just left emotionally destroyed because he made himself vulnerable and put himself in that spot like obviously I know you wouldn't do that to him but he knows you could get other guys right I mean like me I just think that he's not that emotionally secure okay he's got to cut this guy's to cut him some slack man just cut him some slack okay so let's take for example the next one irresponsibility right like not doing chores or just being a general like grown-up fucking manchild slob or whatever right so you frame it like this it's not that he doesn't want to do these things it's just that he feels so overwhelmed by all the things that are going on that he just like you know he can't keep up with his responsibilities I mean look I know that X Y Z whatever thing he's not doing I know that's I know it's not that much you know but he's not in an emotionally healthy place right now and you know he just can't handle it so mirror this of course then against yourself right as the as the image of like the real strong company guy basically making him seem like this like little child okay this little boy then the next one was not being assertive enough in bed okay and by the way this is key and this is very often the best one to use because it's very very common okay so you say something like you know look it's not that it's something he doesn't want to excite you you know it's just that he's so overwhelmed by being with a girl like you that he's not equipped to actually handle your sexual needs you know it's like the look it's like the typical case of like the rich daughter who marries like a blue-collar guy right at first the blue-collar guy is like so ecstatic to have this like gorgeous girl who was like you know who's actually into him but in the end basically he cheats on her with some fucking white-trash fucking trailer trash mullet hair girl okay and because he knows that's who he actually belongs with okay that's who makes him feel good about himself actually so again you shouldn't hold his like lack of assertiveness and bet against him because it's just a reflection of his insecurity you know with the right girl any guy can be like a total stud in the sack it's not that hard you just have to take control you know it's you know then essentially here you kind of like are insinuating that you're the guy that's gonna take control and then maybe transition into some kind of like sex talk where you kind of inadvertently spit how much you need to take control in bed or something like that now the converse that we discussed earlier was like the guy who's into weird sex shit like SNM or whatever even when she actually like hates it close like it's not that this guy doesn't love you it's just that he uses these things to objectify you because he knows that he's never had a girl like you you know and he probably will never have one again once you're gone so you know he doesn't want to make actual love on that level like you know that soul love because he doesn't want to make himself vulnerable right he does want to make himself in that emotionally vulnerable space but he's sex obviously so he has to turn it in this like perverted game okay to keep his like insecurities from overwhelming him okay so what's the next one when the guy gets angry because he initiates Saxon for whatever reason the girls not interested and by the way this is another very very key one to peck at because it's really extremely common so you say something like you know the thing is that this guy loves you and he's just exasperated that he's completely impotent to turn you on and you know he just can't turn you on and he knows that so he gets frustrated you know it's like when you wanna have sex with me it's like I know that it's my job to get the girl turned on right girls need a man who knows that what they want and knows how to get it and when a girl says no but at the same time she like loves this guy you know it often means like please turn me on okay please I want you to actually be more attentive to my needs it's like geez you know so this one totally mine fucks the girl because it's extremely it's an extremely common part of the long-term relationship cycle in other words like one sex becomes stagnant for play nearly ceases to exist okay so I mean that that's just a truism throughout you know for any relationship so eventually most women will kind of like start to get bored of sex once it like degrades for that lack of foreplay however most relationships will eventually have this problem so you must exploit it okay what's another one being too predictable okay okay not passionate enough so it's like look it's not that this guy doesn't love you you know he does it's just that he's so comfortable you now and he feels so close to you that you're more like a sister to him you know like you know a special sister but someone he doesn't feel he has to do all these things for anymore because you know the relationship is just so secure and predictable there's no need for all that excitement because he knows that nothing's gonna change right so you know this is a lot of like a lot of guys end up like this right so you know if you if you really love someone you obviously got to do X Y Z and you know to keep it fresh to keep it keep it going etcetera etcetera right so those are just a few examples of how I would do like the major issues that come up in a relationship while still appearing that you're sticking up for the I but again remember that you are focusing on destroying the guy's sex we'll appeal by making him seem like very too familiar ok very easy to understand people generally get one itis for those who are like challenging ok for those are hard to understand who are mysterious so by making this guy seem like both easy to understand and very insecure very nice very bad aiya in the in the meantime the the relationship will likely not last the week ok now of course we're assuming that it's already built upon this you know insecure foundation because again she probably wouldn't even be engaging with you with you on that level if it wasn't already kind of to the precipice if you will but again remember not to be the orbiter whose counts by counseling her on the problems ok instead you're constantly getting her worked up by listening her values and then feeding them back to her so ideally she should be both getting turned off to the guy that by what you're doing and then simultaneously getting turned on by you and the conversation that naturally leads to how you're different okay and how your ideal for out she actually wants so the natural flow of the conversation must indirectly lead to exposing your highly desirable qualities but it remind you indirectly okay so again she's getting turned on by that direct contrast between you and the boyfriend so again here's the thing you don't want to offer these qualities directly but you want to kind of highlight them by pointing out that you understand where the boyfriends negative qualities are insecure etc etc and you're the opposite that that should all be implicit in that you're recognizing those problems right the very fact that you're recognizing the problems implicitly kind of Sates that I'm not like that so again getting her to sort of almost beg you to tell her how you treat women is all the better and if it's going well it can likely be expected of her to do that right at kind of reluctant to tell her okay not to the extent that you're like sending a signal that her getting with you is not a program that you're down with by the way but you know be like oh yeah yeah you know and kind of like let her like kind of get her to sort of tease it out of you okay so after all this once you got her worked up then you just use standard material to move in and then it's a done deal okay and what are some of the standard material you know just a standard material just like escalate honor if she does bring up the boyfriend well I feel bad about the boyfriend you like look you know I know he's a really nice guy in fact you got to do this for him you got to do this for the boyfriend because you just got to get it out of your system and then you can fully commit to him otherwise you're gonna be thinking about it all the time and again you won't be able to fully commit you know I remember one time I was out in Miami on world summit and I was with Julian I was ringing with Julian on these two Swedish girls and mine was like extremely prickly at first like classic Swedish you know behavior but then eventually we hooked up and then but Julian's girl she was actually at a fiance back in in Sweden and she's like you know didn't want to hook up then it ended up and so I pulled it I took her aside I'm like look you have to hook up with Julian because then you could fully commit to your fiance you know I you know we probably cheated on you I mean you'll be on you'll be on par etcetera etcetera like then you could fully commit only then you had one it's out of your system will you be able to get married and ended it out so then eventually she ends up hooking up with Julian now the interesting PostScript is that I actually saw the girl like my girl actually lived in Miami and her friend was visiting from Sweden but they were both from Sweden so I hooked up with my girl the following year at and winter summit and then I was like so what happened with so-and-so like back home did she actually end up getting in you know married her fiance she's like well yes you know now she's married to the fiance and after she fucked Julian then she feel like she can finally commit to you the fiance because the fiance had cheat on her before which I didn't even fucking know I was just like making that up and she's like and now she feels they are equal and now they're very happily married and I'm like dude so it actually worked it actually worked to make the marriage work out so anyway there it is okay it exists do what you will with this fucking knowledge this information maybe you'll never use it okay but maybe you can glean some lessons about psychology from it that'll help you in other areas okay other areas your game maybe you can use this knowledge to recognize when someone's doing it to you and try to defend against it sort of like a defense against the dark arts I mean they even teach that at Hogwarts okay so it's got to be legit cook or maybe just maybe you're an evil little bastard who's out to cause as much fucking mayhem and you know that's up to you okay that's on you the Karma's with you you just gonna have to live with that and live with the drama that ensues but any case this has been Jeffy and I'll see you next time  we created the hot seat because we didn't want to do

"- Hey, it's me. Your proverbial boy Jeffy and Julien Blanc, and we're coming at you today from Miami, Florida. The home of Florida Man, that wonderful person you see on Reddit doing all those wacky things and eating people's brains while on bath salts. And, what I wanted to talk to you about today is something that's near and dear, really, to get serious now, it's something that really kinda hits close to home for both of us. Something we both struggled with, or grappled with, or come to terms with, or accepted as an important part of our lives, is how what you might think is the worst event in your entire life can ultimately become the most transformative and the best thing in the longterm that could've ever happened to you. If you're familiar at all with any of our trivails, our backstories, our journeys. - Scandals. - Our scandals, if you will. We kinda wanna delve into that and talk a little bit about how these things shaped us and how our perceptions of those events changed over the years. Now, with Julien here, he was actually embroiled in a bit of a scandal, as he said, a couple years ago. - A small one, a tiny one. - I think that you're ready to talk about it, are you comfortable with talking about this? Can we kinda delve into this? - I'm ready to open up. - Ready to open up? Okay, so, cool, yeah. Because it seems like, when I approached you, to actually do this topic, I was like, how's he gonna react to this? Is he gonna wanna be public with this? About his inner feelings on this? And, so, essentially, just to kinda recap what happened, you had a period, a bit of darkness, where you were engaging in some very troll-like behaviors, I guess you'd call them. - Yeah. - And the chickens came home to roost, if you will, and you were put on blast in the global media and censured by several governments and the like. Would you like to kinda just tell my subscribers a little bit about that? - Yeah, so as you mentioned, I was in a tad, small little scandal a few years back and if you know what this scandal is, once more, don't believe everything you read online. A lot of it was complete bullshit, exaggerated, taken out of context. However, it was accurate on one point, which is, I was going down this really, you could call it a dark path, of just chasing more and more validation. And what basically happens is, I felt like shit inside, as most people do due to the way you're conditioned, and you try to fix it by chasing the external. And I thought in the beginning, you know what, if I got a girl, it might fill that little void. And then you get the girl and you realize it didn't work. If I get more girls. You get more girls, it didn't work. If I make more money. You make money, it didn't work. If I get more fame and success. That didn't work. And I literally reached a point where, right before the scandal, I had everything I thought would fill that void. Like, traveling the world, all the travel, cool friends, access to really cool things, more money than I could possibly spend, so much validation from girls, been with every type of girl I ever dreamed of getting, validation from guys cheering me on for getting those girls. It was insane, yet it was still incomplete inside. And I was like, fuck, I need more, more, more, and then of course you start chasing more intense reactions and you start kind of like trolling, putting shock humor out there, (Jeff laughs) and things get out of hand. And it's crazy, I went from having all that to just losing it all at once. - Within a period of weeks. - Yeah, it's like you're walking down the street and get hit by a car and your legs fly off. - Like the rug just pulled out from under you. - Yeah, and it was by far the most horrible experience of my life. So traumatic, horrible. However, looking back at it now and the lessons I got from it, the most life-changing event of my life. I will never take it back and it's what filled that void finally. - Yeah, interestingly enough, and it's crazy 'cause at the time, could you ever think to the future and say, well, this will actually turn out to be the best thing that could've happened to me? At the time, there was no conceivable way. Maybe as an abstraction. I remember laughing with Owen at the time and saying, you know in 10 years we'll be laughing about this like, oh that silly Julien, that time you almost destroyed us all. Lol. But it was just an abstraction at best. Friends were jumping ship. It was the fucking end of days. The apocalypse is upon us. It's like, shit, I guess I gotta get a job now. I'm gonna go work at Starbucks. Hi, my name's Jeff, can I take your order please? Oh, tall mocha, grande latte, perfect. Duh, spills it on myself. That's what I was envisioning for the future, and for you I was like well this guy's done. It's like the scarlet letter followed him. - I can't even hit Starbucks. - Yeah, he can't even get in, see he's not even gonna work at Starbucks. You know, the scarlet letter, branded for life, he's done, the most hated person in the universe, or in the world at least, that was the headline. And then now, looking at you today, it's such a dramatic shift, and I think it led you down this path. I see on your videos you're getting commentary from literally some of the people who spearheaded the campaign against you back in the day, and they're like, wow, look at the transformation. This is real, this is legitimate, it's so inspiring to see that this man can be better and all that. And now some of these people are even attending your events. - Uh huh. - And getting inspiration and getting help with their own issues from you, this villain who they reviled back in the day, and it's just crazy to see that. And the number of people attending your events is higher than ever, so you're more successful than ever financially, but also on a personal level, because I gotta say, beyond even the whole company and the business, I was like wow, Julien is going down. I knew even before it happened, I'm like, wow, man, he's getting out there, he's going, this is a dark path. - Yup. - And you know when Jeffy's saying you're getting a little too mean and outlandish (laughs). - You know you measure it out. - That's the barometer. That's the canary in the coalmine, if you will. And so it's been really cool to see you kinda transform, if you will, and take this more... Where do you think you would be if that hadn't happened, is I guess, the thing to look at. - Well, yeah, what I'll say just in terms of how you can apply this also to your life, is don't be so quick to judge a situation. When things don't go according to our plan, it's a life crisis and we hate it. So my plan was, I'm going down this validation route, and when it happened it's like nope, the universe, the world, God, whatever you believe in, was like nope, you're going this way now. And it's horrible, 'cause we're so stubborn, but don't be so quick to judge. How do you know this is something bad? Maybe, if you actually kept going down that route, and that thing didn't happen, you'd be fucked. You might go through a breakup, you might lose your job, you think it's bad, how do you know? That's the question. How do you know? Maybe you stayed in that job and you'd be miserable the rest of your life. Maybe because you got fired now you found a better job and you're extremely happy for it. - Or the relationship. You found the person you were really meant to be with later. - Exactly. - Et cetera, et cetera. - So you never know. So when something doesn't go according to plan, how do you know and then be open to the lessons. Look for the opening, and that's something I'm still so thankful for to this day. It's like 99% of you is just stubborn. I'm like fuck it, I'm gonna keep hanging on to going this way, and it would've just ruined me completely. - Yeah, where do you think you'd be today? Probably very poor health physically. - Oh yeah, if I kept going down that validation route, I would just be even more miserable than ever. I'd probably be extremely obese, really dark, just this heavy energy. - LV. - Yeah, extremely negative. - Low vibrational energy. - Just dark and heavy. That's what I'd say. - Dark and lovely. - And it took actually, I'm really thankful that I even saw the opening going through it, 'cause again, 99% of me was just like even with this life crisis, fuck it, you're going all the way down. Fuck it all, and I'm like no, look for another way, look for the opening, look for the lesson, and that's what changed my life entirely. And I'm like, holy shit, thank God it snapped me out of that route of validation. Once more, if you're reading about it, don't believe the headlines. And that's another thing, people who come to me now, literally recently had an event that was someone who was one of the main people on the hashtags in Germany who hated me, and she came to my event now and she was like, ""Thank you so much, you changed my life."" And she\'s like, ""I\'m sorry for posting all that shit."" I\'m like, ""Don\'t be sorry, if I read ""the stuff that was being said about me ""without knowing me, then I\'d hate me too."" It was horrible what was being said. Not true, but completely horrible. And now, I mean, fuck, that's what got me out of this chasing the external, forced me to confront my demons, to let go of a lot of the baggage I was carrying. And now I'm like ah, I finally got what I was seeking all those years and it's true, it's crazy how a lot of the people who hated me are now the same people who are coming to my events and getting so much out of it. - Yeah, I think the biggest thing is what you said, look for the opening. Look for the way, when you're in that dark place that seems like you're up against the wall, you're cornered, there's no way out, how are you gonna thread the needle? You know what I mean? How are you gonna get through the eye of that needle? Where is the opening? And get through it. If you read my book, you know when I was 15 years old I was this honor student, straight A student, white class, middle, cul-de-sac, suburban upbringing, Dad's a corporate executive, never got a traffic ticket, all of a sudden, he goes to prison. Some crazy crimes, I'm like, what? I couldn't even believe. And it was like, again, the rug had been just yanked out from under me. I went from this straight A student to a straight D student in one semester. It's like, homework, are you fucking kidding me? Fuck off, none of this shit matters. Putting my head through a wall just to make it hurt less. 'Cause it felt like being on fire all the time. Making bombs in the garage. Dude, honestly, if social media existed back then I'd probably be in jail right now. It was an extremely fucking dark time, but you know what I thought back then? It was like, this is awful. This is like I'm in hell, but what's the alternative? What other choice do I have? Give up, kill myself, commit suicide? Take everyone down with me or whatever, and look, I gotta say, I'm not gonna lie, I probably entertained those thoughts on some level, but the thing is this, man, I kept going, I was persistent, I did not give up. And that's really been, in many ways, the defining characteristic of my life ever since then, is persistence. Right? Do not give up. And I see people and I've had people come up and thank me for writing that book because they're like, I've been through similar hard times and it really gave me the inspiration to not give up. I saw how you went through it, you got through it, you made yourself what you are today. I had no idea back then, and again, let's always kinda do the Dickens pattern if you will, where you see the ghost of Christmas future or whatever. What would've happened had that not happened to me? I'd probably be living a very normal, middle-class existence, like a professor at a community college or something. Not the wacky Jeffrey that you know and love today. Or, know and despise, or maybe a little bit of both. I wouldn't be the person I am today, and I'm extremely pleased with my life at this moment. The lessons that taught me about not only perseverance, but figuring out how to be self-sufficient. I'm also inspired by people who were, say, unfairly sentenced to prison and stuff like that, and they're able to come out and not be bitter, and not be ruined. They spent like 10 years in jail for a crime they didn't commit and they were able to come out and use this to actually transform other people's lives. Look, I'm not a religious person, but there's that old saying, God works in mysterious ways. You don't know what's around the corner. That financial disaster that befell you, you lost everything, that might be opening the door to an entirely new life that's more enriching in many ways than the previous one. So, no matter who you are, no matter what circumstances have befallen you, don't fall into that trap of pitying yourself, woe is me, and I know it's easy to say that in the moment, I know you're like, well, easy for you to say, but again, we've both been there. In the extreme dark, the extreme, extreme darkness, where it seemed like it was a nightmare, it seemed like there was gonna be no way out, but again, you never know what twists of fate will come. And oftentimes, that awful thing that happened can turn out to be the best thing that ever, ever happened. So this has been Jeff... - And Jay. - This has been father Jay and Jay, your two gay dads, your two Jay dads (laughs) and we'll see you next time. Now, Hand of God, the reason we named it Hand of God, you know why? 'Cause God always wins. Because they're not filled with enough conviction. The feeling they're giving off, it's permission seeking. So, you wanna have it more of a expectant vibe, like you're expecting, like of course you're gonna take it 'cause everyone else does. You're almost confused and shocked when they don't. Like you really wanna get that in your head, like I said, like excuse me. (soft music) Who are you? You're amazing. I love you. Your voice tone now is gonna be very, very powerful and that is what is going to enable you to open very consistently. (glass breaking)",Kiqyawc-oIg
what up what up your proverbial fucking boy here in that I'm here in the museum district of Amsterdam van Gogh Museum around me we got some luggage to the lab slip the fungus even if oh that's not a bit of it Evie da ba dee da and we're gonna kick right now into a free tour video that I shot here this week in Amsterdam now I'm going to apologize in advance there's some audio issues so we only have ambient audio but the content was good enough that I decided to go ahead and release it anyway because we need kind of deep one guy asks me at a certain point what my biggest revelation in recent in my recent life has been and I get kind of deep on that and so I wanted to include that so I hope you're going to enjoy it despite the audio issues having said that I'd like to remind you to shoot over real quick to our SD resonator comm to check out my upcoming resonator program what I'm calling the closest thing to a magic pill in the game and that sounds like hyperbole but the reason I say that it's as follows I notice guys saying the same things that we say instead is you know myself Tyler Julian instructor's but not getting the same result again and again and again I notice guys that are relatively good looking guys normal guys and they just can't hook the set I really wanted to dig down and figure out what was going to fuck on here and in 80% of the cases where a guy can't hit the set it's because his voice sucks his tonality sucks his expressiveness sucks and he's not committing to the interaction there's a lot of other great stuff that I folded into this product storytelling the grammar of storytelling humor the structure of humor how to develop humor as well as some in field coaching clips some other interesting stuff so check it out rst resonator calm so anyway let's crack into the free tour did right now and I hope you enjoy it [Applause]  no no I'm all business here man I'm not I'm not I'm saying that I don't suggest the temples of girl but how do I get it constantly dislike okay sing line up so he's like he's I kinda like how do I have a consistent improvement look your is long as you are intelligent about the growth and you're like on it you're being honest about where you're fuckin up and again remember there's a lot of different areas and you get you're going to have times this game is cyclically in nature do you understand cyclically nature you're going to have times where you're doing fucking awesome and then you're going to have times will you fucking suck and you have like a dry spell for like maybe months and you're thinking to yourself holy shit maybe I'm done maybe it's over maybe I can't do this shit anymore maybe you have a breakup and it really affects you and you're down in the dumps for several you know several months maybe again you've got some issues like a health issue or something like that but here's the thing you've got to really stop being so myopic about it or your life focus in on the present you really start to need to back off and think about the big picture and not look at these peaks of value so much and be so obsessed with those but trust your faculties and trust that again if you keep going out your gig reference experiences your brain is originally going to interpret all those and basically it's if you do that zoom out over time it's not going to look like this for medication values it's going to be like again a gradual increase in current and you guys trusting them your father is judging the vector like what about 20 so my dad so again you're a Spears beginning it there's nowhere to go but up for you in the back room yeah oral sex to a stranger to a man's atomic lorry home I'll call the jewelry home how come you don't have a glory hole for pussy unweight again here stop talking I can hear what the fuck good thing okay unwanted opposed to want to disease I found a bug chamber subculture called bug chasing where they try to get dick never understand that shit but uh look man I I believe it's not a politically correct I believe STDs or myth I've never caught that yet night I use your dog on the cotton oh don't laugh I think it might be a bit overblown but I know it's not true deters my buddy he's like literally a walking zoological garden of FTD and idea you told me the other night I got the clap again I'm like motherfucker we've got the claps to what they call that shit applause and he goes any was more like standing ovation when I fucking die but um honestly you know I'm a big fan of the proverbial eating the pussy however you know it depends you just want to give it a visual inspection you know kind of give it a sniff test although to be fair I told this girl the other week and that home and she's my father very very tragic I was like damn she was like saw blah like very much my type now we all have types of it yeah this girl I like her facialist facial features and serve so I was it yeah boy yeah boy and I get her home and I take your panties off and it's like a giant like 70s fucking bush and I'm like wow old school anyway and so I start going on it it smells quite poor the smell is quite bad I like some sort of like pickled herring or something and I'm like and coconut but she's so hot then I'm like signing my mind to like freak myself away again you liked it I'm doing a few more you know what I try to like in my mind like strict myself a month yeah you loved his nasty looking for some I definitely but but even then I couldn't do it I'm like no who do like it's not that chance again so I go up and I start kissing her and then everything was funny I'm a killer and she can like smell it it's like on my beard and she's like damn its sting I look at her I'm like yeah every summer again unfortunately oh yeah that was a bit disheartening but yeah those visual inspection it's up to you so that's a wife - yeah you know this is really weird and I want to know okay I demand answers I want to know what the fuck is going on guys like I remember in rap in hip-hop culture even like 10 years ago it was considered like weakness to keep the pussy like real motherfuckers don't we put it that's the fucking bitch nage motherfuckers that is enough and now you're all eating ass how the fuck did this happen how did you go from it's not obedience look now you're eating ass how does it happen it's great  all right I'm going to try it tonight that okay I'll probably like like what was been your most nuanced idea that you've experienced in the clouds like a paradigm shift yes okay skinny little heaviness um so uh in October of last year my father died and I haven't spoken my father in 26 years because he was 15 years old he committed a very heinous crime against my mother he kidnapped her and her boyfriend at gunpoint and he tortured them in a room for a period of two days I was an honor student nurse and my life was completely destroyed it was like I went from a straight-a student to a D student in one semester because look like school are you fucking kidding me fuck this shit homework walk out of here bullshit nothing matters and nothing matters anymore and so when he died so he was convicted and he was in prison for like ten years and I never caught him after I made I made some attempts to reconnect with him but he never really took responsibility for anything says that extraneous this magic doesn't hurt preponderance doesn't against him and you know he abandoned us you abandoned me and my sister and I you know honorably as it was weird because I felt he was just like fuck I felt relief because on the one level it's like you can't come back to fuck with us anymore you don't I mean but I was very conflicted about so anyway long story short in this January I went out to his home where he had been living in Illinois and so I clean it out and the scene where you live your birth dad he's like this dad will subvert in like home and you living there with some girl woman that was just like obsessed with the odd day but I read from his like journals and shift and it was crazy it's like when that happened it was like that entire time the family died and you didn't talk to them either like all my grandparents outside they died as without me even knowing about it my cousins and my aunts and Kate never talked to me and it was just like that whole chill Tom and when I thought I reconnected we got out there and they said to me that when asked about what happened she just fucking lied he lied about the whole fucking thing to them and they were like what and my dad this is what happened oh it's all these fuck and shit I'm so sorry been talking about Lala and I feel I destroyed people and I thought he was a steel monster but then you know I read his up he wrote like this girl of his life I guess is here to end it from all accounts of my cousin stuff she basically hasn't given up by the end gives us given up and I read it to her home and like in the part where not all that shit happened back in the day but ever in his life you wrote about his life up to that and then at my file not found and then after that but it was like it was this black hole and he like had this elaborate fantasy that he had created in his mind to avoid the cognitive dissidence that would have come from confronting always you know and you could tell he really felt like he fucked up he thought this is fuck of his life you know and he's given up at the end he's just given up and so it was really I guess the big revelation pretty that seeing that I was like holy fucking shit I had seen it as if I monster but at the end I just felt bad for him  I felt like I never I thought it made me think I never want to be like that and so when I see my friends like making randomizes we all reservations right like about you know a little blind spots that we have of our shit we've done should we regret it or shit we maybe should be doing the arms like I know Fran seemed like our alcoholic like straight up AHA so if you gotta stop this shit it what is it yeah yeah yeah and they do the same fucking shit I have prayed to do other things that I've watched on but you know what when I see this shit it doesn't make me think that these people suck you know what my go-to is where am i doing that where the fuck am i doing that and so it's interesting because you get one you get one life right like my dad fucking shot and it's done it's fucking done you can't make it back so that's the thing for me I just don't want to be I want to be brutally honest about what I'm fucking up and I think that for me is like a big again the biggest revelation I have and so you know all of these people that I have like kind of ex-girlfriends and I had like some abilities and like renautas we fucked up in the race shift you know I kind of moved back to contact them and a lot of them like fuck you and I want to talk to you I'm like that's fine nice wannabe else I just wanted it for me really so fuck you ha but security like I wanted to make her and so going forward I mean like I said it had been Edgar but one thing I like about games this game forces you to confront rationalization there's no room for rationalization and games like you get away again I could have done this or done that we just did in motherfucker so again it shines a light and all the little cockroaches go scurrying for cover the rationalization so again that's kind of a big takeaways that I would be you guys where is that so as you know be brutally honest about where you're fucking up and endeavour to be at the point where you're not you know you're not gonna fuck your pipe up and of course your bigness there's a million ways to be a fucking idiot right I got every relationship I'm like okay I fucked this relationship laughs and here's what I did I will never do that again again there's an infinite number of oils to be a fucking moron so you know it's a learning experience for entry okay one more okay thank you and now it is time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the sets that that's at 80% of the time this is the problem Hey please motherfucker a good evening but the way he said it was it lacked that conviction he's like you're hahaha it has is wavering totality the voice this is the roof the mouth right here not just being loud but being clear [Music] that's the touchdown right there it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of a long-term health for your voice you're going to be able to go out and project eternity now you're addicted to my family  you,KmIicY8Lb_U

what's up guys this is Jeff I'm coming out today from the world famous well maybe not so world famous Eaton Centre in Toronto Ontario Canada I know it's not actually called the Etan centers pronounced - Eaton Centre but when I'm out at night and I'm telling the girls I'm going to take him on a romantic dates to the Eaton Centre they always correct me in some dramatic fashion drama is kind of a buzzword on our sea nation these days as popularized by my good buddy Julian the king of drama the aka Damon Salvatore from Vampire Diaries so that's gonna be the topic of this little this little rant I'm going on here today I want to say Rance you know I know Bradley did a little rant in Times Square and it's basically The Times Square of Toronto the difference is my ranch is actually gonna be based in fucking anger I'm really pissed at this whole drama fucking crazy in the forums now you know I look at the forum and it seems that the main page of the forum every single thread is some newbie basically coming in his pants and Jaclyn himself over fucking Julian's drama OK at how awesome it is all right and you know people like ooh Jeff he's mad Jeff he's mad do I sense a little professional jealousy here professional jealousy or your fucking mind people are digging Julian shit great we groomed this guy for two fucking years trained him up to be the next instructor obviously we wanted to succeed a rising tide lifts all boats if people are digging his shit I'm fucked I think that's great I think it's fantastic awesome what I don't like is the misapplication of the principles he's putting forth now look Julian when he creates this drama and he used this tactic basically what it is it's it's kind of like a glorified push ball not even a glorified push ball more about personal taken to an extreme like an extreme push pull right like Julian in one of his videos he mentioned how like one of the old push pulls was you you have like a good girl face but every so often you make bad girl Rizzo's he's like this is bullshit I'll tell her I'm gonna fucking gut you like a pig and drink your entrails over my shoulder like a Miss America sash and like walk back and forth on the lawn until the cops come and they're like oh I'm sorry baby I love like that's the kind of drama he's employing now now it's great tactic it works oh where it's great but the thing is why are these newbies like again like falling all over themselves are drooling all over themselves about how awesome this is okay and I think the root and the reason it's making me angry is because this mentality it's it's the same mentality that make people want to gravitate towards the magic pill okay and this is something that you know they look so iam uses this stuff okay but Julian has put in the work to have consistently good game okay how did he do that from two years of going out seven nights a fucking week and applying these principles putting himself through the fucking ringer okay so he would get the the basics down and be able to be consistent they're been plenty of gimmickry like gimmicky things before it that people have gravitated towards I mean back in the day it was in like 2007 2006 it was the the apocalypse opener which is basically you know you'd go up and say something like hi how are you would you like to fuck right basically or no like hey how's it going so what are you doing later do you want to go home and me I believe that was the exact apocalypse opener and if people liked apocalypse apocalypse apocalypse it's all over the fucking forum it's completely ridiculous you know because guys are thinking that that this is going to be the the magic pill that get some 100 percent improvement of their game you know before that back in the days of ASF it was like the October man sequence game is not about dislike finding the tactic that's when you improve your game by a hundred percent okay in reality what it's about it's about doing those little 1% things all right it's like the devil is in the details okay it's about doing all of those little 1% things dot and executing them dynamically on the fly infield right internalizing all of those things I'm having the ability to execute them dynamically and feel it and it's the aggregate of a hundred of those 1% things that is gonna give you the hundred percent of proof in the game you know again if you have put yourself through the fire and you're able to consistently go out and get results if you add in something like Julian's drama yeah your rittle be amazing you know shit like I said Julian put himself through the wringer he got good at game and then he started adding the stuff in why not as some like magical pill thing but because he likes it he thinks it's funny right in fact I was talking to Tyler about this earlier but why does Julian do this this drama stuff and Tyler was like well you know I think I think at the end of the day he just he doesn't like sex that much and for him the drama is the sex on my plow that's kind of mind blown right so but again you know that's just his personality everyone has a different personality and but again the underlying principles being executed like if you look at the our ski instructors the the personalities are wildly disparate right you got me who's kind of like this verbal is very verbal guy you got Tyler who's kind of like more of a brute force approach these days you've got Todd very chilled out not flashy at all you know Brad just kind of like supreme narcissism assume assume attraction alex fun fun fun you know so again these personalities are wildly disparate but the underlying principle is being an executed are the same and I that's kind of one thing I like about artist II is you have all these wildly different personalities but when you see that they're all executing the same underlying principles it gives you a better idea of how to integrate these these principles in your own personality you know you see you can kind of gravitate towards one or maybe a couple different instructors like I kind of you know identify more with him or him and I see how he's doing it so it gives you an idea to how to integrate these principles in your own game but again the end of the day if you do not have any basic principles down all the magical fucking genie shit in the world is not going to help you you're gonna make a fool of yourself and you're gonna hinder your development long term right so that's basically it a little rant and you know just to summarize here again good game as it were is really about dining the eyes and crossing the t's to go the Devils in the details right so I said that thanks for watching see you later,L9j0VYlGggY
"whoo whoo what obvious your boy Jeffy I'm here today in Stockholm Sweden and just cracked out from the wonderful free tour phenomenal very high-energy astiz uh as Trump would say high energy tremendous energy love the crowd best crowd at Sweden ever tremendous let me tell you believe believe me believe me okay so when anyway in this video we're gonna get into a couple of interesting questions particularly a young boy who seemed rather rather frail in his ways he indicated that he has an ongoing problem with aggressive dudes trying to clown on him trying to a mug him so we delve into that topic as well as a couple of others anyway about to crack off to bootcamp now just want to do a quick little intro here check out the video hope you enjoy [Applause]  okay first of all this being recorded so I'm not going to games now because it's quite crude and it's quite shameful and basically I would say you just use profession yes and don't get into a situation where you have that happen yeah use protector get a fucking vasectomy that's part of your best bet I'm gonna get a vasectomy too because of Trump I swore that when Trump won I would get a vasectomy now because I not because I know all my children to grow up in a Trump world or any bullshit like that but rather because his record appointments will likely make it illegal in the future next question okay this isn't the interesting how small to see here we're talking about your hundred thousand people yeah um okay do you want like the feel good answer you want the real answer do Rios the real answer is you fucking move and your fuck sorry no I feel like that sounds like this flippant answer but it's legit it's like dude look let me tell you why guys are so focused on the ship and guys tend to gravitate towards one and pick up what are the tactics that guys tend to gravitate towards what are they like multiples or something Laura welcome some of the most famous tactics that you've heard about from pick up and approach the spam approach the hand of God and of God's actually amazing because you know why it's called the hand of God right because God always wins so but seriously  Julian drama number one Julian was doing all that wacky trauma shit while back that was really popular the apocalypse opener that well that tinder opener I was hating on guys love that back in the day was called the October man sequence you know with all this like these flashy things but guys they like those why because it's flashy right and they're looking for the magic pill that's going to get them the fuckin amazing result and they think it needs to be flashy you know gives you an actual result the fundamentals fundamentals will get you the result not the flashy shit work on the Mel's eye contact sexual line contact no one no one's interested in that it's not sexy on contact I want to say some shit on a rape a black man so what's another one vocal tonality that's not sexy at all fact it's so unsexy that when I said I was gonna do this is a product oh it's like I don't think that's sexy enough people don't want to buy that you're like well we have a frame it right obviously and then once I started bringing out this event where we kind of rolling in Los Angeles been there's 500 people in the room we're bringing people up and like running them through these exercises and it's becoming so apparent that 80% of guys can't even fucking do this shit you ever seen those videos where the guys are standing up at Golan's like yelling at them talk louder talk louder I even did this past weekend in Copenhagen the guy he wasn't projecting good so I'm like talk ladders have all this shit like it like it's a thing it's like a known thing why is it a known thing because it needs to be fucking said what's another one logistics logistics if you know all the fancy tactics in the world but your logistics are garbage what's the point going to show up I would say this a guy with an advanced guy with shitty logistics will not get laid as much as a newbie with perfect logistics this has got him this just a flat-out truth okay let's say you have a newbie who lives across the street from the club across the street versus a an advance guy who lives in like some fucking shithole that's 40 minutes away by car  did you see why the newbies gonna get laid more all he has to do is it hey Mario Kart it's right there that door let's walk over and you'll pull I mean maybe you won't invade maybe you won't be able to close the deal they're not gonna pull every fucking night because if the girl has to get in a vehicle to go to a second location that's a whole nother layer of complexity right so again guys are when I hear this you know I live in this shit town how can I do this sex ain't like I fucking I don't even have you know what I'm saying it's like you don't have a red equipment to learn this shit because the thing is that would be fun if you there 100,000 first town it's fine if your games already tight but the thing is you're gonna have to you want to make an omelet you gotta break a lot of eggs especially in this year so very quickly you're gonna become like the town either a village idiot who was known as this cretin exactly so again the way to go about that is you gotta look either replay a very safe game which kind of sucks that you're in a retard or growth very far their growth in the sense that you're not getting the better as quickly because you're not gonna push the boundaries this is why I thought you guys didn't what's the best city in the world to learn a game lost fucking Vegas and you know why it is literally designed for it is a 24 hour a day a partner 365 days a year okay maybe not 24 maybe there's like a dip there's like a dip at 6 a.m. like 6:30 a.m. time and so like 10 a.m.  all fucking day yes in a given week you might see the same girls cuz they're there for like the vacation remember but come Sunday a whole new fucking crop from all over the country and all over the world ready to party and ready for you to act like a fucking social retard and make fun of your son you're never gonna get a reputation and you're never gonna have to deal with these issues so again it can be very useful so I would suggest at bare minimum a queue if you can't move look I'm getting maybe can't move but at least make little outings possibly to places where you can start to kind of push the boundaries more and while you're there try playing a little safe game I've never received game believe it or not you know and we'll talk about that a bit when we get those some of these videos and stuff but you know a lot of guys they and they prefer to play the wacky game just supers their personality better so what kind of a person was here but I would ever choose like I want to be all gloom and doom like oh you're fuck you're done you are so by trying to get out of there as soon as possible okay what's next yes love this outfit by the way very classy any of his 35 or older first of all you're both projections terrible I can barely understand what you're saying are you very stung right now or something  you're fine  but over 35 years interesting day and I'm talking about this before no I'm 41 and last year last summer was the best year of my life last were the best year of my fucking life I in terms of game maybe money he had the most fucking fun like that it ended I had the most obsessive game every games like banging fucking young girls in a van left and right of all of it I believe that was Jesus at one point I literally believed I was Jesus I actually I knew on some level that wasn't true but on some level I also actually believed me but it was crazy to me to think that that age 40 because a lot of you guys are very young and your eye can see and you're probably thinking Jesus Christ you're probably thinking but I'm 30 like I'll do this and I've heard this before from younger younger guys that are I'll do this till I'm 30 and then all settle down you know that's what all set them down okay well guess what it's not like you turn 30 I'm like some magical clock ticks over wears a tick it's like well don't want to know that pussy no more no hot with no hot gums pussy for me anymore time to settle damn some wrinkly asshole bitches  time to settle down with old dating uterus is about to shatter into a billion pieces okay that's not gonna happen especially if you're actually good at it then why the fuck would I do that like honestly a man's like highest sexual market value if he's staying on his path my new is around 40 you know if you're in shape if you're following your bliss or whatever and you're actually successful that you're doing something you love your task your passion you're fucking up you retain the youthful layer value because you don't surround yourself with old people and bold dressed like an old person again I'm not saying you want to like skate dad like Steve Buscemi a fellow like ac/dc shirt on but but but still regardless like that's what I was when I turned 30 I was like I kind it was a little scared oh well that number down now I'm gonna have difficulty hooking up with the early 20s girls now yeah and so what happened was I have trouble hooking up with the early 20s girls again because what I believed it I like doing on this old motherfucker now I'm outclassed they're gonna judge me oh I'm going on it because I thought that the number one ruling game in my opinion is this whatever you feel they do so if you think you're this like creeper that's getting away with murder by hooking up with these young girls of course they're gonna fucking think however as I you know grew into my late 30s and I started to have more and more success I got the reference experiences alike yeah actually it's just as easy if not easier to hook up with those young girls because my game is better I'm more grounded I know what the fuck to do I'm coming from a place where I'm more like legit really in all ways so I started getting more success now I don't think it's getting away with murder I think it's fucking awesome right and I'm now very routinely hook up with girls who are literally half my age in some previewer man so and it's phenomenal and absolutely fucking phenomenal so again for you dumb guys I want you to understand this this shit never ends it never ends haven't you want to settle down from a proactive place absolutely do that okay monogamy it's not for me okay I'm not judging it some of my best friends are monogamous it's like something every this would say like friends you know but it's not for me but you know if you want to do that then that's fine and honestly I think that learning game in many ways it puts you in a position where you're better suited to be in a relationship because if you are in a relationship you're generally staying in that relationship why because you are proactively deciding to stay in the relationship what was the opposite of that when I talked about at the beginning which is what why did I stay without women for four years cuz I'm scared I would be able to get some as good does that make sense I was scared I was gonna be able to get something as good so I stayed in it out of like scarcity in fear get ground zero back at ground zero them so so again like it makes me more present in the relationship another thing to like you see so repulsion game you become desensitized to bullshit not because like disrespect and perceived slights from people and things of this nature not because you somehow develop a thick skin about it but rather because you will arrive at the realization that it doesn't fucking matter it doesn't fucking matter what those people think it doesn't matter what this and that and again I really have very little consideration for what other people think about me on a personal level unless they are somehow involved in law enforcement they're a judge maybe they're involved with the Internal Revenue Service of the United States but aside from that if you don't like me sorry perhaps I can suggest eating a bag of dicks have the whole bag bitch right have the whole bag so fucking bad but but again I'd say that you've got to familiarize yourself with it just do it and have faith in the more reference experience you get the easier it'll become okay anything else let's do a couple more how do we deal with aggressive guys okay two things number one  I are you getting this frequently right so there's a couple of things here number one generally people okay what will tend to generate an aggressive response two things number one is poor social intelligence like you're approaching in a way where it's blatantly disrespecting the fucking dude and you're oblivious to that fact so look when these guys come in or if I go in and there's a guy there if the guy says like normally I will ignore these guys I will complete ignore but note not complete complete ignore I'm just not going to engage them I'm not gonna be like oh yeah man like lucky and keys what you're saying and respond in a logical fashion and actually give you room to fucking like argue with me about your perfect like no like if the guy says something I'll be like me yeah yeah awesome and then right back out of the girl so the thing is what happens in view of the full ignore it could possibly become anger disrespect bro disrespect so again I will do that bare fucking minimum now can't I verbally to all these guys absolutely I'm very good at I just do it all the time but again anything that opens the door and allows them to get their foot in like look now you 5% of the news I can tool burly just because I've heard all the lines before I had responses for everything as I've been doing this for 15 years and like it'll usually take to back and forth like we'll say something like people will laugh like so many insults but I've heard it a hundred times before so I probably have three different comebacks to it or maybe so they're okay which one do I want to do I guess looks fucking tool and you'll see them as odd so I'll be like if I continue down this road I'm going to look really stupid so usually they didn't they didn't just shut up but I don't even do that anymore because like I said 90% of the time I'm gonna be better than them but 10% of the time I'm not and so why even give them the way I can give them up there hold right you can give something a line so again I'll be like what a little acknowledgement that out now  I'm very able to read and this is something that you guys need to cultivate is more empathy not just to the girls but to the other people to the staff in the venues things of this nature I'm not saying you should be concerned about micromanaging people's perceptions of you but you should be aware on some level don't take them to heart don't take it personally but be aware of the dynamics of the situation and understand what you're doing so again a lot of time these guys would like to go just sucker punch me if I'd like if I want to have seen the set he probably would have been acting like some kind of autistic less when Asperger's fucking take doing some retarded shit not even looking at the guy and like the guy was getting mad and obviously posturing and puffing up for like several minutes up to that and the guy's just oblivious and then against this fucking head caved in okay so that's number one the second thing that will tend to generate this is if you're giving off an aura of weakness if you're giving off an aura that you're afraid to get you're afraid or you look very physically frail ok so again if you are very physically frail I would suggest taking steps to correct that in the sense maybe you need to hit the fucking weight room a little bit if you're going to be going out and stepping to fucking steroid cases and I try to rip it or yank three girls off of them again not just for not for the girls but for your own personal health as well or even that I'm not the biggest guy I know nothing about fighting nothing about fighting you know several times I've gotten into fights I've always started it okay and I'm not very good at it I was a girl right it's real are separated okay but again I'm not like afraid because I've been punched in the fucking face before I guess what it's not that bad doesn't even hurt that bad just you see a little white light light on your face looks weird for a couple days fuck off thank you so I get like you can open the set better probably with a black guy Yanis peacocking  fact when I've never back in the day one time we probably would style he has to be applied like discard you might like this movie scarf might be as good went out like that so again like getting to the point where your frame is stronger like look you heard that phrase you learn how to fight so you don't have to yeah right so if you get a guy who a see anyone here tape leg martial arts so when you do like if you take a lot electric Jitsu or boxing or whatever you do get some drunk guy come in - he's got a posturing you can tell you is an action officer fighters wants the same face or whatever you guys look man sorry I offended you okay there's no to to visit you book I apologized do you want me to apologize again or are we good here and a lot of times like again you know you can look at your eyes and see that you're not afraid to go they're gonna smell the weak isn't jump on you don't be bullies look for that bully bull he doesn't wanna get hurt bull he wants an easy target so again number one becoming more aware of the dynamics that play and kind of noticing when guys are starting to go up like that and then secondly getting yourself to a headspace where again this is happening a lot maybe you need to again work out a bit maybe need to take a couple of rudimentary boxing classes or something like that so you have a better idea that you can handle yourself now the second final thing is this regardless of all that maybe you're the best luck at most socially calibrated person on earth maybe you are human you take you're a black belt in three different disciplines of martial arts but some asshole still fucking wants to square up I mean sometimes you just get a drunk fucking asshole who's out of his fucking mind there was no provocation he's looking for a fight that happens here's the thing though that happens so infrequently that it really doesn't even warrant generation it happens so infrequently that it's not something you should be worrying about it's like Muslim terrorism or something it's like oh the Muslim oh my god it's like if you have more chance with you might even buy a fucking shark okay so again I wouldn't waste mental energy on that shit but again you're getting a lot those are the two main things to look at am i provoking it somehow and do I have an oblivious what is my awareness of the situation not good and by the way if this is something that you're uh you're interested in a really good book that I've read a lot of books on this subject from former law enforcement guys about like the interview process that happens they come to interview process when they're sizing up a victim whether it's a criminal or whether it's one of these drunk assholes wants to fight again they'll come up and they'll do several things if you're interested in reading more about this I check out the book the little black book of violence I forget who it's by that's a really good one author Rory Miller's another really good one it's got Kane I forget his first handbook but again there's a lot of interesting things out there you shouldn't just be walking around in like whites mode like there's white mode yellow motor revs mode and red mode like bikers oblivious like it's Disneyland birds are chirping nothing bad can ever happen me you know then like yellow is again you're aware of what's going around right by the way you should be in yellow all the fucking time maybe not here you know how do you tell the council something's gonna happen here but still like just walking on the street you should be aware there's like some weirdo following you like trying to square up on you ask you for the time in a weird way Asian of that nature and by the way in a game situation you should be aware of what's going on the periphery always because maybe it's not a guy that wants to fight maybe it's the fat friend who's talking to another fat friend and their third they've been watching you pick up the friend for the past five minutes and they're going like this oh my god yeah you know they're making like these motions to the girl but here you are and your happy ass is even fucking realize come on come on sterile let's go yeah and they'd blown away what happened daddy came out of nowhere no motherfucker man he has been talking shit for five minutes and you're so locked in here and you didn't notice so again let's see I'm doing that I see Fatih fucking doing that what am I to do I'm done as your friends I live a bit skeptical okay let's go meet them good evening I'm Jack your friend and I love one another and we hope you approve of our union I'm gonna fuck that shit off the fucking packs I prevented the whole save her response right then and there so again I'd say the number one we're proactive without being aware of what's going on the vicinity and then taking pains to make sure during the headspace where you're not like present yourself as a target okay anyone else yeah front again yeah okay how could you convert beacon group with escalating yeah argue what is your sexual orientation so that's how you can ruin this plane because you want to fuck your girl I don't understand the question what does that mean oh I get you get a boner right yours is yours with blood when you meet an attractive ones you're interacting with an attractive woman yeah that's how your control that's where the congruent comes from does this make sense Yeah right again good but I think it means like  and now it is time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot hook the SATs at SATs at 80% of the time this is the problem hey but the way he said it was it lacked that conviction he's like you're hahaha it has this wavering totality the voice this is the root of the mouth right here okay not just being loud but being clear it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of a long-term health for your voice you're gonna be able to go out in  my family  [Music]",MuGQSGwvTq8

"- Yo yo yo, what up it's your Proverbial Boy. I'm coming at you today from some kind of hill or something and today what I want to discuss with you is an issue that was brought up by someone on the Facebook Execute the Program group. About some issues he been having where he's just kind of feeling over a game. He's kind of tired of it or he's having a depression when it comes to game, and let me read what he actually sent. He said this, ""Hey guys, ""I\'m not sure what the hell\'s up with me right now. ""I broke up with my LTR back in July. ""I\'ve been doing ETP and some IRL games since then. ""I\'ve been going on dates but I stopped ""a couple months ago from lack of interest. ""I\'ve been feeling less motivated to do anything game wise ""and I have a large backlog of messages ""that need to be cleared, even when I\'m out. ""I don\'t even find women hot or attractive, ""it\'s more of a meh! ""Maybe I\'ve caught the game. ""I say this as someone who\'s been involved ""with game for nine years and has had some incredible ""relationships from it. ""I\'m not really sure what to do ""or if there\'s an underlying problem I need to address ""or if there are residual feelings between myself and my ex ""and yes I\'ve done the whole stop jerking a thing. ""I can step away from it without issue ""but just end up unfocused and slightly irritable. ""Have any insights or do I just need to stop being a chode ""and slam through it? ""Thanks."" Well the first thing that stands out to me is he said maybe this is me still having feelings for my ex. Now that is a very, very common thing to have happen when you have a breakup. I mean I don't care how tough you are, if you've been in an actual emotional relationship with somebody for a while and then it's broken up it's gonna feel like an amputation. At least for a short period of time, right? So that may very well be the case. Having said that the old adage, go sleep with 10 other women is very sage wisdom and definitely holds true today. I remember after I broke up with my last LTR. My last long-term relationship, the first couple weeks after I just went on like this fuck spree. I guess you'd call it for lack of a better term. Where I did like 10 girls in a couple of weeks just to be like, you know, okay you can do it. You can you can still do it, right? Like it's still, the magic still there, you still got the mojo, but after that I was like, I got sick of that. I was like, ""Well you know but it\'s not her, ""but it\'s not her,"" and then I went through this concomitant period of you know several months where I would, I was just kinda in this funk until I just started deciding to just date around more casually and then eventually I got to the point where I no longer wanted to replace the girlfriend. Like I got to get a new girlfriend, right? It was just like I'm just casually dating around and only then, and Julian said this to me, he\'s like, ""Only when you no longer ""want to get another relationship ""that\'s when you\'ll actually get it,"" right? It was at that point that I was actually able to be open and for more healthy place where I was able to actually be open to that, and where it wouldn't be like every new girl I was dating I\'m like, ""Are you gonna be my new girlfriend?"" It's like off-putting. You know what I mean? She\'s like, ""Whoa, step back Jack. ""Like a little too early for this shit. ""You know aren\'t you jumping a few steps here, right?"" So and then finally I found someone new, and but again that may not be what's actually going on here. It could be actual depression. Now as I've said many times to a variety of clients over the years, you know RSD, the instructors we are not licensed mental health professionals by any means and you know I've had students where I'm like, ""Look I just can\'t help you. ""I believe that your issues here are beyond my can,"" if you will. Like, ""This is beyond my ability to fix. ""You need to see someone who can provide actual ""like psychiatric help."" Depression is no joke. It\'s not just, ""Oh I feel, you know, I feel kind of down."" That's not what depression is. Clinical depression is where just everything not only doesn't give you joy but feels like actively painful to you and in that case you should probably be seeking like professional medical attention. Beyond that this could just be a variety of other health issues like physical issues. It could be, you might want to actually go get blood tested and get your levels tested for hormonal endocrine levels. Like see if your testosterone is low. I don't know how old this this guy who wrote this is but you know once you start to approach that age of 40, like myself, you get into what's called andropause, where testosterone drops off rapidly. You start losing motivation. You start losing that ambition to go out and achieve and succeed and do stuff and yes, have reproductive sex time, right? So that might be the case. Might have a deficiency and again if you are approaching 40 I think there's nothing wrong with looking into testosterone replacement therapy, at, you know, not these crazy super physiological doses. Like Ronnie Coleman or something. Like injecting yourself like five grams of fucking bull semen in your neck. Your carotid artery every morning. But rather just getting it checked out. Getting your levels like to a nice baseline or it could be even something less serious than that. It could be just like vitamin D deficiency and that's a serious issue as well that can cause a lot of problems with just your general sense of well-being, and additionally it might just be poor nutrition. Poor nutrition especially as you get older it can make you feel very sluggish. You won't have a lot of energy to actually take action. So one book that I found was really good for this, just on the topics of not only nutrition but supplementation is the UltraMind Solution by Dr. Mark Hyman and he addresses a whole host of issues in there. From like possible blood poisoning from heavy metals. Chelation therapy stuff like that but that's yeah, that's an incredible book that helped me a great deal to get my nutrition dialed. Again The UltraMind Solution by Dr. Mark Hyman. But I think ultimately you can have your nutrition perfectly dialed. You could have, you know, the the most, you can be a young man Hale and Hardy at age 25 in like the height of his sexual prime and you could still have these issues, and I think and I've said this many many times. To be successful at this endeavor and to be you know motivated to actually go out and kick ass whether it's Fitness, whether it's your finances, whether it's pickup, you need to get emotional leverage. That is the bottom line. This is a concept I've talked about in many, many videos and the reason I do talk about it so fucking much is because I think it is fundamentally one of the building blocks that's gonna 'cause you to be motivated and 'cause you to take action. Tony Robbins this is a concept that he pioneered and or at least talked about a great deal that helped me in - and I have a quote here from Tony kinda describing what emotional leverage is. He\'s like, ""To access leverage ""you must help someone associate ""massive pain to not changing right now, ""and massive pleasure to making that change immediately. ""The motivation is based on both."" So it's based on both avoiding things that are painful. You know avoiding the the pain that's being caused with that and moving towards the pleasurable aspect. So to get out of apathy you either increase the level of pain you're associating with not changing or you increase the goal that's associated with changing. I think the whole like no fap, the not jerking a thing, I think that works on the pain side of things. Like I got obviously I can't get off any other way. So I need to actually go out and handle my fucking business, and by the way with the whole no fap, I mean I've I've stated before that I didn't like it and so on and so forth. I thought it was kind of goofy, but I grew up in a different time. The time that I grew up in was when we did not have internet porn. If you wanted to masturbate, when I was a youngster, you would have to like open the JCPenney catalog to like the bras section or some shit. Like literally. Now these kids from age like ten can like be like midget fisting porn at the drop of a hat or you know whatever. Like all manner of like myriad perversion at their fingertips. So again I think maybe that has changed things a bit. So again I think there's a benefit to that in terms of getting you to associate pain with not going out. So that might be helpful, but again this guy said he's tried the whole thing and it didn't work for him. Just kinda getting brain fog but it could work for others. The thing is if you aren't excited by these girls that you're seeing out, if you're not excited by the girls that you're approaching, then the bottom line is you need to go after hotter girls. I mean look, I've been doing this for 16 years and I've hooked up with girls on all ends of the spectrum. From one to what I consider to be a 9.5, seven, eight, two, three, and I can tell you going through the motions of hitting what you consider to be like average girls that can feel pretty soul-crushing after a while. So I mean obviously it's easier to go out in real life and find hotter girls. It's also possible to find some very hot girls on the internet too. It just takes a little more time and if you aren't getting with the girls that you want off the internet, then you either need to work on your profile, you'll need to work on your texting or your messaging. You need to work on your pictures, but it is possible as well. I mean some of the hottest girls I've ever hooked up with, my last like three girlfriends, were actually were girls I met on Tinder or like okay Cupid. So the hidden gems are there but bottom line is you need to start going after girls that like light that fire that kind of grab you by the boo-boo and make you be like hmm! And give you that motivation. The thing to understand is that and the RSD lifestyle, Like the going out and beasting. It is in some ways inherently short-term if you will and the reason I bring this up is because you know this guy he said he's been doing it for nine years, and if you think about it this going out, approaching a lot of girls that's designed to build the skill set. So a lot of times guys when they get the skill set they're like okay what now? And then they can kind of hit this sort of like almost existential crisis, like plateau type thing and oftentimes this manifests as what this guy is actually describing and I think professional athletes experience this a lot too. When they actually leave, they retire from the sport, they're like kind of like what now? You know what I mean. They've they spent all this time growing up probably like training obsessively. Getting all this adulation for it. Enjoying it immensely that becomes kind of like tied up with their identity. So now when it becomes time to move on to the next stage of life they're sort of like aimless and confused. So once you've acquired the skills to like the degree that you're actually comfortable with, because everyone's got different goals. Like not everyone wants to be this like, crazy pickup superhero that like lands in the club in a puff of smoke and like pulls the girls and like flips on double back flip onto a motorcycle and like pulls them out for like a foursome every night. Like not every wants to get to that level. Some guys just want to get to like a level of comfort but they're like okay I've got the level of confidence that I desire, it's like now what? Now how am I supposed to like reconcile this like crazy going out lifestyle and seeing a lot of the things about how like attraction works and how people often react to different sorts of stimuli and it can be almost kind of like I don't know demoralizing and you're like, how can I be in a relationship now having seen what I know? You know stuff like that or how do I transfer this kind of like crazy going out lifestyle and shift it into a more like sensible kind of settled down lifestyle if you will. If you want to have like meet the one, have the family or what have you. I can seem kind of jarring to do that, right? The thing is, the game is cyclical, and even if you get into a relationship it doesn't necessarily mean that, okay that that's it forever. I'm in a relationship forever now, right? I mean things change, people change. You have a breakup, you might have to come back. You might have to go back into the dating game and the great thing is once you learn these skills it'll always be there. I've always said the game is fucking eternal like motherfucking Eazy-E, and what I meant by that is the game will always be a home for you once you've learned these skills. You can always go back, you might have to shake off some rust, you might have to pick up some of the old rhythms and stuff like that but my experience and I've had many times where I've had like down cycles and stuff like that it might take a couple weeks to get back into it but once I found that emotional leverage to really go at it hard again, I\'m like, ""Oh, yeah, right,"" and it comes right back at my fingertips, and the great thing about game too is even if you are in a relationship and you get out, like I said you might you're going to inevitably experience like what I described earlier. Like that whole feeling of amputation and these like stages of grief and stuff like that, but again once you get back and you find the the next girl or the next girlfriend. The next relationship is always going to reflect your increased level of social skills, your increased level of game, your increased level of pamperee if you will. Like every girlfriend I've ever had has been hotter, has been more in line with the type of girl I want. I am like it just like ratchets up. So in a sense you should be excited to look and get out there and meet new people and find that new person. I get it when you're dating it sucks because a lot of times when people you meet suck but there's a lot of really cool people out there too and it's like an infinite array, an infinite mosaic if you will of humanity and you got to like find what you want, and the more you date around the more you're going to know what you want, and on the flip side the better. Like the more relationships you're in the more you do game the better you're going to be in the relationship because for me I know every relationship that I ever had. I've looked at both what about her resulted in us breaking up? Like personality wise what was the conflict? But additionally I also looked to see like what the fuck I did wrong and I resulted never engage in those kind of behaviors again. But here's the thing, I\'m like, ""You know what I\'ll never ""do that dumb shit again,"" but guess what? There's a million ways to be a fucking idiot. (laughs) But at least I won't do those behaviors anymore. Like I'm not gonna like communicate with her in this way or put ultimatums and stuff like that. Those are just a couple of examples of things I've learned in relationships over the years that contributed to, it's sort of like the entropy of the relationship if you will. So you learn both on the flip side it and back. The thing is again that's what you can expect. That's one of the benefits of like learning this stuff long-term. Like you carry it forward with you. I mean look at the counterpoint. I'm sure we all have a story of like that friend we knew in high school who - or college who kind of didn't really get laid very much and he finally found one girl when he was like 22 who was into him and he got laid and then he end up getting married to this girl essentially for sex, and now that guy's just locked into this relationship he may absolutely despise 'cause again he has no - he knows if they were to break up, he would be completely lost he'd be adrift at sea and it's a terrifying aspect for him. So he just has to cling to this relationship out of like desperation, and then if he does break up he's, it's gonna be just probably like some acrimonious divorce. Take half as money et cetera, et cetera. It's just a terrible place to be coming at this from. So when you are in the relationship as a guy who's learned this stuff, when you're in there it puts you in a much better place because you're gonna stay with her out of choice, not out of scarcity and again because you've had these experiences. Like someone wants like on the on the ETP board, like going and doing a bunch of like pickup. It's versus like getting to the relationship. It's almost like doing a bunch of like online poker hands all at once versus actually going to the casino and sitting down. When you're going and you're doing that online poker stuff and seeing all these hands in rapid succession, what you're doing is you're learning pattern matching you're learning pattern recognition. You're learning how it operates and the rhythms of it and stuff. So then when you actually go and played the real game for real stakes you're much more well positioned to be successful in that. The bottom line is this, if you don't feel like going out and doing this right now, then don't. Like don't try to force it, just allow it to come naturally and understand, like I said before I've had many of these cycles and sometimes you're just not feeling it. You know focus on other things, focus on yourself, focus on your health and wait till the inspiration comes naturally. The most important thing is that you never give up hope. You have to understand there's a cyclical nature to game, there's a cyclical nature to life. Like for example back in October, November of 2017 last year I actually quit drinking for two months because I had let myself go and I had become quite rotund. Quite voluptuous if you will. Not quite to Owen level. Oh no he didn't, but you know what I mean I had gotten pretty fat. Like my clothes, even my jeggings were getting like kind of bulging and stuff and I\'m like, ""What the fuck!"" You know and I've had, if you followed me over many years you probably seen like I've had times where I was like in very good shape and then I kind of got fat and I went back and forth. So in my mind I'm like this has happened before and what, in this case what happened my cat died. You know R.I.P young puff. My cat died back in June of last year and so I kind of went to this depression spiral for a while and I was like shoving my face and drinking a lot, which of course contributes to the fatness. So I was like look here's the thing, I know how to do this. Here's how I handled the nutrition, here's how I do the gym, here's how I like handle this and sure enough in a span of two months I lost 15 pounds. They're shredded right off and guess what you know I'm in decent shape now. Of course the holidays came and now I'm somewhere in the middle. So I think as I know this is probably gonna happen again, in the future and I'm cool with that. Because again I accept that it's that cyclicals nature of life, but here's the main thing. This is something that I learned when I was a young kid when I was 15 years old. It's like I you know I had some terrible problems up with my family. My dad went to prison et cetera et cetera, and I felt like I was in hell. I felt like I was in, if not depression some sort of like living hell, where I felt like I was on fire all the time, and you know what came to me it's like I'm strong enough to get through this, right? And I'm just gonna keep going. Like what's the alternative. I'm just going to keep going. Like there's that old saying, when you find yourself in hell keep walking, right? So keep going don't ever give up that hope. Trust in the cyclical nature of the game. Look into some of the stuff I discussed earlier in this video and again just wait for that inspiration to come naturally. The game is never over until you're in the ground or your dick falls off, whichever comes first. This has been Jeffy from some kind of hill and I'll see you next time. (upbeat music)",N3JIP707e4E

when I put up its ya boy here and today I want to talk about what it actually takes to learn game at a level where it becomes simply who you are as opposed to something that you have to conscious now this is obviously what everyone's striving for but few people actually realize what it takes to achieve this kind of transformation now during my tenure as a real social dynamics executive coach I have met a lot of guys I've been running live in field boot camps in cities all over the world since 2002 and in that time I've literally worked directly with thousands of people helping them to take their success with women to the next level and that's obviously a lot of experience that are bringing to bear in these videos so if you're interested in real talk okay as opposed to that BuzzFeed pick up advice then take a little moment here to LIKE and subscribe down below to get new content coming at you every single week so one thing that's really important to me when I'm running my programs is the idea of effecting a deep lasting identity level change in the students right that's the phrase that you might have heard in our marketing copy etcetera etc but it's really something that we really want to bring to the table now look it's really not that hard okay I'm gonna tell you straight up it's not that hard to take a guy out pump the hell out of his state and you know give him a little bootcamp high for the weekend and you know if you're really good at it you might even carry on that little boot camp I into the next week you know the last four he'll have a nice little boot camp glow for a week when he gets back home okay woohoo yay but again at RSD were not interested in that okay we are shooting for nothing less than complete transformation now it might not happen immediately on the course of the weekend but that's the the longer-term goal after a boot camp our intention is to take a guy from whatever level he's currently at and take him at least one level up over the weekend and this is not an unrealistic goal right because I see this practically every week and I'm actually doing it I'm actually achieving this now of course at the end of the day well it's gonna be the students responsibility to take what he's learned on the bootcamp and you know bring it to bring those lessons to bear on his everyday life and some guys do struggle with that concept and it makes sense okay because what we're proposing here is nothing less than a very dramatic overhaul of their very concept of reality so one thing that will often tell students our bootcamp is this your identity as it were if that's a very fluid concept okay your identity is fluid now it's a very slow-moving fluid like say molasses or honey or something like that a viscous fluid but it is fluid nonetheless now I had a student a couple weeks ago and he asked me we're sitting in the van doing debrief and he's like Jeff I noticed when you're not talking to the girls you know you're very voluble you know you're very confident you're very forward you're very outgoing were you always like this and I said no I was not always like this if you were to have met me 15 years ago I would be a very different person so he's like so what made the change what made you change your personality from that to what you you know for how you're presenting yourself today and I told him I was like well I saw that the I was doing didn't work right the way I was behaving before it didn't work and that is what actually gave me the emotional leverage to let go of those certain disempowering identity and behavior patterns and that can be kind of difficult even if you know that these certain characteristics or these ways of presenting yourself are not serving you it can be difficult to let that go why because even though you know it's disempowering it does feel kind of like a little bit of a death because it is you it's how you identify as you it's you know when you think of yourself that's one of the aspects but once you do resolve once you decide to change however you arrived at that decision well from that point it's only a matter of time however that does not mean that the process is going to be easy necessarily it doesn't mean that it's not gonna be challenging so the first and the possibly most challenging step is learning to trust a I guess a foreign set of bearings you you might call it now as a small child growing up this is something you've dealt with on a continual basis and one example would be learning how to walk okay you get up you fall down okay you get up again this time you stagger around a few steps and then bump into the  table and then fall down again table and then fall down again and so it's through this process of trial and error that you familiarize yourself with those bearings okay those reference points that you need in order to be able to move around standing on two feet okay like if I lean too far forward I fall if I leave too far back I fall etc etc so this is the process that we're talking about when we refer to internalization and it is at the heart of identity level change now there's one small problem with this though as a child you probably weren't all that concerned about appearances okay social conditioning had not yet exerted that pressure on you to look cool to make you know or whatever right to be cool to make sure that I'm presenting myself in these ways that will protect me from the judgment of the group now to be completely honest the kinds of challenges that you face on a daily basis when you were a child learning how to walk upright you know learning how to communicate verbally for example those were far far more difficult than anything involved in learning how to pull girls from a club okay however back then you persevered and you handled it why because failure was simply not an option but now now you're a smart guy now now you're smart now you know better right now you're not just conscious you're self conscious it's a bunch of  okay look if you okay look if you applied this same kind of thinking back when you were a kid you would still be rolling around the ground crying and yelling and screaming and comprehensible gibberish now actually I call that Friday night but that's a different video entirely okay but in any case what's the solution here well once you know what you need to do once that foreign set of bearings has been laid out before you that's when you have to employ your willpower okay hate to tell ya but that's that that's the not so easy solution okay you simply don't resist it and you diligently execute right action until it's all been internalized okay you begin laying down reference points how by means of experience by going out and doing it until that new reality becomes cemented and that is where you move from learning to doing and finally arrive at that state of being that we're all striving forward with you know when you're out doing pickup okay so let me give you an example of what I'm talking about here as it relates to to game to pickup and I remember when I first started going out you know I was I was to the club for example I was full terrified of it like I would literally be walking up to the line the line up outside the club and like I just not even like a good Club like my neighborhood shithole and I would hear the music inside and my heart was our pounding and I would be I would almost have like a I would say a panic attack but I would become uncomfortable okay I did feel a sense of dread I would be gripped with this sense of dread and I would think to myself holy I can't believe I got to go in here and do this right and that was just walking up to the club okay never mind actually approaching girls once I got in so over time my mind learned that going to the club and talking to women wasn't the same as diffusing a bomb and consequently my physiology no longer responded like that okay why because at that point I had internalized the lessons and when I began working with real social dynamics I was then give of course given the opportunity to travel the world and I began to visit some literally some of the hottest clubs on planet earth right sounds like a dream come true right wrong because here I was used to operating in my you know the I had become the big fish in my small pond of San Francisco these are like this little hipster scene or whatever and then when I started hitting these like turbo venues if you will it was a bit of a culture shock I mean back then I would go down and visit the project Hollywood mansion and you know you're going to these Hollywood venues would like the velvet rope you know the fake boobies the whole whole you know or as we say la the city of fake tits and real assholes okay so in other words you in there you'd be in there like talking to the girl and all of a sudden like a literal celebrity comes up and steals her away from you so it was a bit of a culture shock right so when I first went to these kind of clubs you know Los Angeles Las Vegas etc Miami I felt like I guess you've got like I was an interloper that was somehow allowed in by accident by like exploiting a glitch in the matrix like I felt I didn't belong there not not at all okay however as I became more and more accustomed to being in those kind of top clubs or whatever that changed like initially I still felt felt like it was a tough venue quote-unquote but my thought process was more along the lines of like you know I'm Jeffy I've trained for this I can so I can deal with it okay okay so that was the first kind of shift that that happened and later on down the line after clocking even more experience it finally actually began to click and I finally internalized it completely you know nowadays I'll roll to excess in Las Vegas or you know Marquis whatever live in Miami and instead of thinking oh my god you know it's so loud the girls the girls are out of my league the dudes are all jacked and cooler than me or whatever instead my internal monologue is something like this like this is the best this club is the best I am the best therefore this is for me oh look here are the hot girls also for me right and basically when I when I walk into these clubs now I'm like oh like I light up like a kid that got to the front of the line of Space Mountain at Disneyland or something okay like it's like oh yes this is where I get laid and I just have fun there now now another example I see and pretty much every weekend is guys that don't escalate on the girl okay because why well these are often very new guys and I'll say what's your sticking point they'll be like well I can go talk to the girls but then it just kind of fizzles out right and then when I see it like usually the sticking point there is they're not escalating so they'll go in they'll chitchat and I'm gonna get like a nice to meet you and then the girls will leave so the problem here is these guys have two conflicting drives like number one they want to the girl of course but number two they don't want to get embarrassed so why they don't take it to that romantic level out of fear that it's gonna blow the set however you know on a given bootcamp night like if they're playing this week sauce half step or game the nice guy like interview mode game they might get 20 nice to meet use in a row right where it's just again starts out okay like the girl hello and then it just fizzles out so that's at the point like you know they get this aggregate of nice to meet use and that's the point when they finally get the emotional leverage to start embracing the process okay I'm gonna have that process of beginning to start to trust that set of foreign bearings so what happens then well they begin communicating romantic intent to the girl and how do they do that well we teach them how to do it you know through various ways that we instruct them to over the course of the weekend that's you know a better eye contact proximity vocal tonality statements of intent incrementally increasing contact etc etc and yes it is uncomfortable and alien to them it's not easy just too low now Jeff told me this thing I got the emotional leverage like despite having the emotional leverage now they're gonna do it despite the pain because the other pain was like the other pain was real this is a speculative pain but so they're gonna do it but it's still gonna feel uncomfortable and alien to them as they practice it but as they practice it they see that whole lo and behold it actually works better than what they were doing before okay and slowly but surely they begin to move into that place where the Mo's behaviors start to become the default action ok so a big part of bootcamp is helping us push past your comfort zone ok but not so much that it causes you to like have a meltdown and run and cry in the men's restroom ok that that is the way this sort of incremental pushing of the comfort zone that's the way to make a true identity level shift in your reality ok you use your faculties wisely in order to trust in that set of foreign bearings until they aren't internalized so take a look at your game identify an area where you can put this into practice tonight so this is Jeff and I'll see you next time and I'll see you in the field,NNu5GpyuFqM
it's your proverbial boy Jeffy and today I want to share with you some footage from a live event that I did recently for my program resonator which is of course a program designed to help people cultivate powerful healthy vocal projection now in this clip we're gonna be discussing Alexander Technique which is of course a postural technique that were developed in the late 1800s now posture is the beginning it is the foundation of all healthy voice projection so it's very very important to cultivate this not only for voice projection but additionally for just overall confidence the way you move through the world so using these very very simple techniques I might do this is just a tip of the iceberg of Alexander Technique and I will always recommend this to students of mine who have a salon over hunched-over posture and I had a guy recently who was 6 foot 2 and because it was hunched posture I thought he was like my height simply because he's been conditioned from a variety of things over the years to just default to that posture so when you engage with these techniques which are very very simple and can be done anywhere even in spare moments over time this will help you develop a general better posture and you'll feel more confident you might feel taller and generally it just feels like you're communicating with your entire being as opposed to from behind a blocked wall so let's jump into the video before we do that though like to remind you to LIKE and subscribe and I hope you enjoyed the video let's check it out [Music] you guys do you follow Tyler on you know YouTube like Tyler hey guys yeah right so if you listen to Tyler's voice if you watch his Instagram stories nine times out of ten he looks like he's about to pass out and his voice typically sounds quite hoarse and Scratchy and that's due to him pushing himself very hard you know oftentimes walks on stage talking from like noon to like 9:00 p.m. and then straight out to the club for like a 16-hour day of screaming of people so literally by the end of that weekend I used to get in the cab to go to the airport on Sunday and like the guys like where do you want to go I don't know what accident that is but I'm sure it's offensive to somebody but uh okay he's like where you want to go I'm like uh like I literally couldn't even speak dude and I'm an addict like pantomime and airplane like it's like oh I take you Airport right and it would take me there literally we cook we come home and like all the instructors have struggled with this and we would come home and you know have to be on several days of enforced vocal rest where we literally can't speak I have a whiteboard I'm like writing shit on it like some sort of mute and my girlfriend at the time she would love this shit she's like this is fucking great normally this motherfucker never shuts up you know now yeah it's like peace and quiet you know I'm not saying that that's something that you guys are gonna deal with like you know because you're probably not putting your voice under that marathon stress however you know I'm sure that we've all felt a little hoarseness maybe at the end of the night especially in a loud venue if you've been out of Vegas Miami even the latter venues here you know you know I'm sure how many guys go to like temple that's pretty loud environment you know and you gotta strain your voice to be heard so I this was kind of a near and dear thing to my heart so I started to investigate why why this was happening and then secondly I noticed a lot of times students would come up on boot camps and they would be saying the exact same shit I was saying we'd like okay go say this and they'd say it and like when we said it like myself Julian whoever the girls would get a you know we'd get a good result they'd be like laughs they turned to us they'd pay attention these students go out and often they're not even getting looked at like they're going up and they're like hey excuse me in the grocer's ignore like full ignore like they're fucking like they're this thing like a fucking chair a piece of furniture and just full ignore and like that should just happen to me back at way back in the day obviously you know what else we're starting out and I don't think there's any like worse rejection than that like even like go fuck yourself midget you suck your old well you know whatever you're fat you're old you're dumb you suck your game of shit like whatever at least that they're acknowledging you as a human being you know I mean like okay they're acknowledging your presence and it's like treating you like a piece of furniture it's quite dehumanizing it's one of those things that if you get it enough like guys are like you know what this shit is dumb it doesn't work I'm big town now good ma'am a man going my own way pickups bullshit you know and and it's it's quite sad so I went to and no so by the way so when I had the idea for this program I I started kind of floating it around on you know my channel and around the boards and so forth and people are like well this sounds like a good idea but you know how the fucker are you this a joke like how the fuck are you qualified to teach this shit like you're not a vote voice coach so they were right and so what I did is I paired up with Susan Nance who's a vocal coach who lives here in San Francisco I basically went through an extensive course with her not for singing because she does vocal coaching for singing but I'm like do you work for just likes public speakers she's like yeah I work with actors I work with lawyers who have to be in court giving you know presentations and things like that to develop a strong vocal projection now it was interesting because I have a pretty good vocal projection just just normally from it's self-taught you know from two things number one doing pickup just as we all know women will punish bad gaem ruthlessly like a lot of guys would say how do I get to like I had the student last weekend here in town and he was like he's like you know I get the I get the ideas and he's a smart guy this is one of those smart guys like he actually understood the ideas you say do this and he'd go up and do it but he wasn't really comfortable acting in that milieu I guess of like being a more like outgoing person in a more aggressive person and when I say aggressive not in like a scary way in like a fun and cool way like hey what's up damn girl like you know that kind of aggressive he's like I'm not like as loquacious as you garius remember you want to fucking call it outgoing he's like how did you get like that I'm like you met me 12 years ago 15 years ago very different person I could barely even get a word in edgewise them in my peer group stuff like that he's like well how did you get that I'm like well I went out a lot and I saw girls didn't react well to that and I was like well I have to change right it's like saying you know some guy who starts to learn boxing and he's like you know I want to do this but I just don't like to hit people in the face that's just not me it's like well that's what it is motherfucker if you want to be successful at it you got to do that so I had to learn to be more outgoing I had to force myself to kind of adopt those behaviors until they become the bait that they became congruent and they became quite a cool of me so there's a combination of things like I said I'm a self-taught in those two ways but when I started going and learning the sort of the the science behind loud vocal projection powerful vocal projection attractive healthy vocal projection it was interesting because a lot of the maps that I had invented in my head of how it looked of how like the voice box works of how noise is produced how it how you do it in a healthy way a lot of them a lot of my ideas were right you know the map I created a lot of was right a lot of it was way off the mark so it was pretty mind-blowing to me in a way to learn these things in something like shit you know what this is something that I think a lot of people could learn cuz I got really sick of dealing with this first on boot camps right because it's like before the guy if he I can't even fucking talk like how many guys have had this experience you go up to the girl in the club and you're like hey bub a lot opener it might be like the funniest shit in the world but then she goes what and you repeat it again louder every time even today a lot of times in the first couple of sets of the night I'll go up and I'll be like hey blah blah but it's just not quite loud enough which is like what buck and at that point I know I'm fucked like no matter how good I am after that it's probably fucked because she had to ask what like I said I got sick of teaching guys this stuff first you know I just can't fucking hear you speak up speak up and oftentimes it's interesting because I'd be like opening the bootcamp and we're in like a hotel lobby and we're lie okay so okay so tell me a little bit about yourself name age occupation and the guys like I'm like speak up a little bit I actually can't hear you okay it's like 2 decibels higher I'm like look you got to talk louder so my name is Bill and I can't do it right like look dude if I can't hear you in this like in tiny enclosed space how the fuck are the girls gonna hear you in the club right so and then of course they go up and they're getting blowouts Clause boss so so this is why I cultivated this program now like I said I'm gonna be slamming through this is you have a limited amount of time we've got a couple hours what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go over some of the main principles and this is stuff that you guys can employ tonight go out and use tonight immediately after this right so I'm gonna go over the principles and then we'll be bringing guys up and work with you in real time actually to kind of start to fix some of these issues now here's the the benefits right the benefits that I got from it I don't lose my voice anymore after those long weekends I don't it gets a little scratchy but not not to that point we're gonna go over it in basically four parts there's four main components to this number one is the actual production of noise from your flapping fucking meat hole okay the actual production of resonant attractive loud noise okay that's number one and we're gonna break that down into a couple subcategories number two is your actual vocal tonality that you're employing when you go up to the girl and so that's gonna immediately affect her perception of you right off the bat number three the conviction with what you're saying this shit and number four emotional variants like are you going up and are you like hey how are you doing - doo doo doo doo doo it's like this emotional flatline and you want to hear from the Midwest originally yeah I noticed a lot of guys like from back east and the Midwest they tend to have that sort of flat effect and it's it's really rough to get them to kind of shake out of that and be a little bit more expressive in a sense where even you're they're talking about mundane things the girl will be interested in it simply by virtue of the enthusiasm of which are saying this stuff okay so with Volcom projection there's five main I guess pillars that build upon each other to kind of help you create the tone that we want what do you think the very first one is for the very first found what is the foundation of vocal projection what's that Bang posture exactly so that really kind of blew my mind because I thought oh it's like breath control breathing from the diaphragm something like this but when I started working with this this Susan person who by the way you may have seen in you know the various videos and I know what you're asking no I did not have sex with her now that was like the number one comment on every on every YouTube I was like Gil hunters calm bro like I said yes no but in any case what what Susan basically taught me in terms of posture was using something called Alexander Technique to achieve a confident neutral posture okay now when we say confident neutral posture what is the opposite of a confident posture like slouched you know not taking up a lot of space in the environment just kind of like you know very inward right now the polar opposite of that would be like an overly confident posture so that's what most people think they go from this and now all of a sudden they open it up and it's kind of like this like you know this sort of like like fucking Vince McMahon shit you know like where they're like kind of just throwing around and by the way like is anyone ever here got laid and then going back to the club yeah you went you fucked and you went back to the club okay if you have you know that's like you actually you actually walk back that congruently so we don't want to like go that to that exaggerated possibly want a confident neutral posture and this is going to be the foundation of vocal of good vocal projection now who here has ever heard of Alexander Technique a couple people a few people most people think of it as like a postural technique but it was developed to fix a vocal problem now quick backs when Alexander Technique it was developed by a guy obviously called Alexander and he was an Australian actor like Mel Gibson I don't know how anti-semitic he was but he he was an Australian actor in the 1800s the late 1800s and he would do like Shakespearean monologues that was kind of his bread-and-butter and while delivering these loud monologues obviously you know back in the day they did not have amplification they didn't have electrical you know systems to or you know a mic so he would have to project very loud and so what he found what happened is you know he'd lose his voice at the end of these performances right and again he was gripped by the same terror that we feel like holy shit that's my bread and butter I need to fix this shit so I went to a variety of doctors they're like nothing's wrong with you your voice spot you're fine so he started to think maybe it's something that I'm doing there's nothing wrong with me like physically but maybe it's something about my behavior which for the time was kind of radical you know sort of radical thinking because I don't know they fucking put leeches on your asshole and shit like that back then right medicine wasn't it was advanced to think that maybe your behavior was causing these issues so he stood in front of a mirror and he did he like you know contorted himself did different things and what he eventually noticed is that he was um his what he would call the primary control which is where your head sits upon the top vertebra of your neck like your c1 it was down and like back and his whole like shit was starting to like kind of Crouch inward and he was holding stress not only in his neck but in his chest his abs his quads and his ankles so he the first thing either was released when he calls his primary control so if you do that right now like take your head and and don't physically move it with the muscles just kind of make it loose and move it with a finger almost like you know you're hitting the top your heads on a swivel right and instead of giving it down and back you started to move it up and forward almost like you're sniffing something on the air right like like like pie cooking or like some you know some sticky icky icky so to speak right and then he began to release all the other stressors right so all the other I guess tension he was holding so we again to do this right now release the tension in your stomach your quads your ankles and just keep it like that like significant something nice okay so what it what do you think are a lot of things that would that caused this what could cause this well obviously back in the day you know in survival instinct if some animal was stalking you or you saw like some frightening thing you'd be like like to become still and in the hopes that we might not see you now we're not being stalked by animals here unless you're like walking through the Tenderloin at 3m or some shit like you know have some crackhead or something but but you know we have a variety of other stresses work stress you know kids from a young age heavy backpacks you know caught you know causing this physiological adaptation over time bills work etcetera etcetera sitting you know at a computer stations for long periods of time things of that nature so it's very important to to start to develop awareness of this right and that was one thing that she drilled is just develop awareness of this so another thing by the way this a big one is this you know right so this contributes to that that posture which locks in over time your kinesthetic memory and it's becomes habitual right so by releasing the locking patterns we were going to free up our postural reflexes so what are some ways to practice doing this so why don't we stand up real quick and let's try this so we're gonna run through a couple ease and these are really simple exercises you can do them anywhere right and that's one thing that I've been doing in the wake of learning all this stuff just in my free time around in the spare moment you know when I'm like waiting in line at the airport or what-have-you I'll just do this stuff so first unlock primary control just sniff something on the air up and forward now release the tension in your abs like consciously quads ankles and now let's rock kind of back and forth like forward almost like you're going off a ski jump and is back and feel how it feels differently when you're when you're actually loosened up okay so now we're gonna do a little game to lengthen out our spine so what I want you to do is this you're gonna put your fingers down like this at your sides straight fingers straight down okay turn the palms forward like so and now bring them up in front of you like that now this is almost gonna be like a kind of a counterbalance so you're gonna go back on your heels a little bit just a little slight amount and then bring your fingers up to touch the tops of your shoulders now from there we're gonna raise our right hand straight up in the air as we bring the left elbow and arm down okay like that and now we're gonna drop the right arm and when you as you drop the right arm feel that side of your back kind of lengthen out and it's kind of shake it out a little now let's do the other side so fingers down forward up kind of back on the heels a little bit touch the shoulders left arm up and now bring it down and loosen out the other side like lengthen that out so these are like it's a little loop more loose now right so now it's kind of feel how that feels you can rock back and forth a little bit and feel how you're more loose your posture should be a little bit more neutral a little bit more relaxed so as you're walking around now you know as I walk around I feel like a lot more upright you know what I mean it's a lot more lined up okay so have a seat and here's another thing when you're sitting in a chair because how many guys have like day jobs where they say the chair a lot yeah so when you're sitting in a chair in fact it's do right now so sit up sit up a little bit more on the edge of the chair right now you see I'm like this and if I don't met a workstation a lot of times I'll be like  especially for long periods of time for like editing videos or something like that so instead I'm sitting like this rock forward come on your sit bones a little bit like kind of rock forward on those on the that sit bone so you want to sit on the edge of the chair and rock for it and this will kind of naturally cause your back to straighten out and now again your primary control loose get the head going sniff the air a little bit and now think of like arrow is kind of coming off the ends of your knees and releasing the stress right now everything should be like more in line you don't want it to be like like this this obviously looks extremely uncomfortable like some sort of curve right so like lordotic curve here just wanted to be like everything kind of sat right on top of where it should be right so again if you're sitting in chairs for long periods of time from time to time if you catch your your posture slipping like that consciously kind of rock back on those sit bones release the tension get your get your primary control loose breathe it out and kind of try to try to maintain that posture for as long as you can right because again as you do this here's the biggest thing the more that you adopt this stuff the more that you're gonna naturally walk and stand and sit this way in your daily life right so you don't have to think about it right so by the way if also another thing forgot about one thing if you are on the in that seat of position you can also put your your hands on the table in front of you and feel your spine lengthen out like that as well right so that's some different things that you can do so again you might feel taller you might feel more confident you might feel more grounded your breathing is gonna be freer when you interact with the girls just just walking up you're gonna be speaking to them just like when somebody's standing like that it's it almost feels like you're interacting with the whole person as opposed to some sort of blockage in between yeah Uncle Jesse yeah just sit down shut the fuck up don't hit your fucking brother you like it what how does it feel you like that yeah don't do this don't do that sit down shut up blahblah the other but you're dumb you're dumb you're dumb yeah damn drunk you're dumb your clothes are stupid you know all this shit over yours the media act this way this is the way this is the way this is way you're gonna be shamed if you act dismissed now you go into the into the club and it's like holy shit do I look cool stay in my little zone stay in my little box don't express myself stay within the strict parameters that I believe are going to protect me protect me protect me from the judgement [Music],NgUtZvfdC7U
yo yo what up its reverb yo boy Jeffy I'm here today in my home in San Francisco California with my colleague and good friend our SD maze welcome welcome welcome we're here in front of the fireplace for a little fireside chat with Bruce Lee the inventor of Jeet Kune Do the the martial arts discipline that has provided comfort and solace to millions the world over or something I don't know what I'm talking about but I do know what we're gonna be talking about which is what what's our topic today relationship management / staying out of the relationship zone staying out of the relationship zone this is weird because because a lot of a lot of people they want to get into the relationships shift is zone they're like how do I you know make that happen how do I make that ship sale that relationship sale I'm gonna sail off into the night on the wings of love and they want to go there but others who are involved in the art of learning I guess pick up is that a bad word these days can we stick can we still say pick up right if you're trying to learn game you might want to stay out of it until you get more experience and all often tell my students at the end of a boot camp weekend I'll say one thing I would caution you to do is not get into a relationship for like maybe six months just so you can start to wrap your head around how this stuff actually works and to internalize these concepts and they're like well okay you know it seems easy enough but the fact of the matter is especially for new guys like well I haven't been able to get in a relationship I've had much luck getting into relationships in the past I doubt that will happen but it's like now you've been armed with this knowledge you're gonna go out you're gonna practice this stuff and you're going to get laid because just going out there you'll see it is actually not rocket science I mean we can make this stuff complicated we can make it super complicated or we could try to make it as simple as possible and when you do go out and start interacting with people lo and behold who knew as the great philosopher from the 20th century Cindy Lauper said girls just want to have fun so they're gonna hook up with someone and then if you liked her enough to hook up with her once there's a pretty good chance you're gonna like her enough to want to see her again and then one thing leads to another and before you know it you wake up and you're driving a minivan with three kids and you're you know you've moved in together and all of that you're like how did this happen and then we see these same guys I mean it's great for us financially because we'll see these same guys in like a year and a half and I'm like oh awesome ready to take it to the next level I guess huh cool oh yeah and then and then we go out and they suck and then I'm like why do you suck I thought you know you've been doing this like well you see about one week after the program I got into a relationship and now I'm essentially back at square one because they didn't have time to actually like adequately internalize the lessons so for those of you who are in that headspace and who want to learn the stuff and want to avoid at least for the time being getting into relationship gonna discuss some of the pitfalls and and how you can actually manage that in a way that's you know has some kind of integrity to it and you're not you know being deceitful or anything of that nature and you're still managing those expectations you want to kick it off yeah 1% so it's funny too because I'm actually at the point where I'm like should I have a contract that they have to sign though they're getting it in some monogamous relationship at least for a year after the boot camp because it's kind of the same like hand on the heart like oh you will not get into a relationship yeah it's it's crazy because it's exactly as you said like they'll come back a year later a few months later and yeah the game sucks in fact I literally just got last night when we were out at the karaoke bar I got a text from a guy who you know was a student maybe like seven years ago and he had gotten married and he's like I just broke up with my wife turns out she had borderline personality disorder it was like made my life a living hell and you know and again look relationships don't last forever ah you know that's that's true you can't expect that to let you know it's it's not the time of my grandparents who were married for seven years and the game will always be a home for you but yeah I mean it is something we see time and time again and these guys just come back on the bootcamp so great for us from like a work standpoint maybe not so great for the guy yeah well the thing is like you what skis that you choose a relationship out of abundance most of these guys get good with their it gets a decent level on there getting results and they picked the first shiny object that they see without thinking it through and that's that's what the issues lies but just just avoiding the relationship zone when you're focused on game I'm just not over this like I had one of my girlfriends just text me like two we get two days ago I was like hey be on your best behavior over there and San Fran because if not then you know you're you know and I'm and for me I'm just like haha that's that's funny and I just move on with my day because I'm focused on what I want to do I'm like a monogamous relationship is the furthest thing from my mind that's not what I want at all so that's the first thing I would say it's like what do you want be very clear and be very upfront about where the relationship is right I mean I've had that in the past to where you know I had a girl I was kind of seeing and she wanted to take it more serious and I wasn't ready to go there quite yet or maybe not with her ever you know and they would kind of put throw these look there's something that you've probably heard me say before you watch these videos is they'll they'll be cool with it until they're not yeah right and everyone you know every every relationship does have like an expiration date at the end of it and when it's time yeah I'm not gonna be like I mean first of all it's kind of ridiculous to think that somebody would how much how do i phrase this you know like look guys like well how do I let's start at the beginning I guess here like how guys like how do I let her know that I'm not interested in that well it's kind of a weird thing because I've never like actually said that to someone that I just started like seeing you know with some regularity I'm not like I'm just I'm not ready for a relationship right now it's like they to the contrary it kind of just like seeps out of my pores that I'm not that guy if that makes sense like in fact I you know I saw some girl you know I hooked up some girl a couple months ago and as she left as she was leaving I said oh hey yeah you know we'll give you a call we'll go out again and she's like I don't know you don't see like the kind of guide that has a lot of second dates what like you know I think again I guess whether it was just like I was so smooth or like obviously it's not my first rodeo type of scenario very comfortable and in that kind of situation who knows but I saw again I have the opposite problem where even if I'd like when I do want to give into a relationship they can't believe it they actually they can't believe that I would want to do that so I don't know what is some like what are some of the sub communications that would kind of help guys just kind of avoid having to have that discussion in the first place do you think well yeah for one you should be actively gaming and not just dating her right because if you're just dating her and you're spending a lot of time with her her natural response is like oh what is this like we're spending a lot of time together and vesting a lot of time with you so what are we right so you should be definitely actively gaming seeing other women you should be seeing women in between seeing her where that already draws out from you that you know I have options I have abundance and I'm that's not really what I'm looking for right now it'll it'll come through your mannerisms yeah that's a good point so you'll often see questions like this we're guys like well what should i do how should I behave in order to give myself the appearance of having this abundance so well or although say things like you know don't don't like text her back for a couple days so it looks like you have a lot of cool stuff going on you don't have time for it's like well how about instead of trying to like emulate those behaviors you actually have cool stuff going on or you actually are seeing you actually do have this abundance so you're not going to be giving those vibes off so so that's number one is actually walk the walk if you don't want to get into that relationship right right then be walking the walk of the player and go down like truly will embrace that path another thing too and you mentioned this as well I've gotten this in the past to where the girl says something like like again again they're cool with it till they're not and then it gets to the point where the like dude I just don't think I could do this anymore and I've had girls give me like an ultimatum like it's either the game or me and I like I literally said that like it's either the game or me and I'm like well oh I will miss you like oh I'm like I will I'll miss you but if that's what you have to do to feel good you know then that's what you have to do right and you know it sounds like some kind of like jokey line but it's it's not it's like I literally missed her but like that's not gonna happen so I'm gonna let you free I'm gonna let you fly free into the world to find that milquetoast lawyer guy that you can settle down with and have the family with and that's it sounds like it's based on a true story it is you see them like on their vacations in Cabo their kids no no no it's great it's great good for huh and I'm actually in the past I've even done the OP like I was proactive about it when I could I could sense she was starting to feel that way you know how can you sense that like she's like calling you or like a lot more or she's like you know like I had a girl that would she would say things like so I saw you were at the thing like because she saw on Instagram like they're clearly like following me or they're like what are you doing this weekend you know aren't you going to like New York because they're like reading the rsd schedule and stuff like that you know you can tell they're getting like a little too deep into it you know or like you're on your phone they're trying to like look at your phone and stuff like that they're getting a bit too attached at that point you know all either a put distance between it and or call it out and be like you know I feel like you're getting a little too attached here and I'm not there yet you know that's a big thing I used I used to try to just like I don't know I don't wanna say like sneak around but like just like I would never bring it up like I would I would lie would like actively avoid these discussions and like frame control it away in Entourage with uh he says something like um like why would I break up with a girl when I could just draw it on like out and on and on and on and on and never face it at all and it's funny too cuz I used to be like I'll wait for her to bring it up yes all right 100% like I'm never gonna address it I'll just wait for her to bring it up but and I mean I guess I were so certain extent if you really care about her and you see that it's it's going into a realm where you're not ready to go and you know that's what she wants it's I find it respectful to just address it well yeah because you know it is it's it is possible to have those two things to like actually care about somebody and like like them as a person a lot in in everything and having like a great deal of respect for them but you know just not want to move in together you know or not want to be exclusive together and that's the thing so you know like I said number one you got to have that abundance and then it's gonna come through and your demeanor and your personality that you're just kind of guy who has a lot of options and you're likely seeing a lot of people and the I obviously the other thing the other thing so that's who was like maybe you're like well I don't have abundance right now the thing that will help is it won't be exactly the same but that will help in that in a similar way is if you're just taking massive acts yeah and Ward's your goals it's like when we used to say get more girls like it or Max's little pithy answer to most questions on like forums is like go out it's like get more girls doesn't necessarily mean you actually are hooking up with a ton of girls I mean that's like the bet the ideal meaning but just you're are you going out are you talking to a lot of girls are you talking to a lot of people are you actually taking massive action another thing to bear in mind and this is like an old kind of just a nuts and bolts thing is you're definitely going to want to limit the amount of time spent like because the the glow about growing closer to someone is largely a function of time spent together wouldn't you say that's that's the case I think that the old the old advice back in the day was like no more than once a week if you're trying to just keep it if you're trying to keep it a friends with benefits type situation so what's your kind of thoughts on that yeah that could be cool I would say just be seeing girls in between her or again going back to the same thing like just take make sure just taking massive action those who things will help keep the relationship and a space we're just friends with benefits if that's what you want so just take massive action or do you have that bun that's where it's like it's it's just bleeding out of you even texting a bunch of girls helps us shit ton just texting even if you're not getting laid texting a lot of girls at the same time makes you feel as though you're in that bonus that that alone switches your demeanor right so just to kind of recap here number one make sure you're coming out from a place of abundance so you're not giving off these vibes of wanting to go into that into that space number two be kind of cognizant of how much time you're spending and you know kind of keep that limited unless you're you're willing to maybe explore going into that relationship space and then number three when it's done it's done you know understand that that they'll be cool with it until they're not and you have to be willing to let it go right because that's the thing you know what's the what's the song if you liked it you should have put a ring on it as they as this as the song goes so it's like look if you're not going to commit you have to expect that it could you know be ready for the possibility that she can just be over it and bounce so if you're coming down from that headspace I think you'll do pretty well so yeah that's pretty much it just a couple of quick actionable tips for those of you who are starting to go in that direction with your so-called friends with benefits to keep things on the level to maintain integrity and to stay out of the dreaded relationships of the Jeff and maze sit down shut the fuck up don't hit your fucking pussy like it wow does it feel you like that yeah don't do this don't do that sit down shut up blahblah the other big you're dumb you're dumb you're dumb yeah yeah you're dumb your clothes are stupid you know all this shit over here's the media this way this is the way this is the way it's way you're gonna be shamed if you act this now you go into the into the club and it's like holy shit do I look cool stay in my little zone stay in my little box don't express myself stay within two strict parameters that I believe are going to protect me protect me protect me from [Music],O2GpbRrBsWk

what ask you about the yeah okay okay so I think that when I hear stuff like that that indicates to me black and white thinking right like either the girl either I get a you know 20 minutes of nice conversation followed by a nice to meet you or I get slapped in the face and a drink thrown on me right there's no in-between the real man's blowout doesn't mean the girl is kicking you in the gonads and calling the cops that it doesn't mean that the real man's blowout simply means instead of saying humoring you and then saying nice to meet you she says I have a boyfriend and leaves do you know what I mean or she gives you a very very clear I am NOT interested sir right so in other words basically what do we say the real man's blow out I mean yeah I guess the term itself doesn't vite fantasies of you know getting real man's blow out punched in the fucking head or whatever you know but but really it just means you're getting a definitive answer that I am NOT interested in you romantically okay so for like for me real man's blow out again it'll just be the girl will like walk away she'll fuck and leave you know basically to me here's what I think  fake man's blow out I guess that'd be the opposite the fake man's blow out or like you know the pussy blow out or that not blow out at all is where again she gives me the nice to meet you I have to go to the bathroom find my friends go dance kill myself okay so it's not okay let me rephrase this the real man's blowout is not so much what she does it's what did I do did I communicate as a man to a woman so basically what I when I say get the real man's blow out it's more of an exhortation to the guy to communicate as a man to a woman when he hasn't been doing so yet right those are the guys like are you escalating shit right yeah so yeah I've never been kicking that's either but well except I like my friends but my so-called friends but but but you know let me put it this way if you communicated on all five levels of mance all five channels rather of man two women communication and she leaves you can consider that in your head I did what I needed to do right think of it more like that I did what I had to do to step up I stepped up I communicated as a man to woman now what are the five channels five channels are as false number one eye contact right because guys get confused that but I what is man two women communication what is this constitute and you know the first is obviously eye contact so many times and this is like for a new guy that I get a program this is the number one thing that will make an immediate improve in it and like demonstrable quantifiable improvement in their game is simply standing in front of the girl and looking her in the eye that's it it's very very simple but guys don't think that like they think they're doing it on bootcamp I tell guys I say look I want you on every girl tonight to square up and look her in the eye when I say square up shoulders shoulders directly in front looking react are you going to do this they say yes every guy invariably says yes I'm going to do this to every girl and consequently they then go there and then they like say this is the girl like it's like this would be squared up don't stand like this or like this or even like this and they think it's squared up this is not fucking squared up this is squared up this is squared up think of it like this you want to think of it you want to be standing in a way that you can fuck her missionary okay could you fuck a girl like from the side maybe if you're like kicks like that or something if your dicks like fucking 15 inches long and you go like slip it in the side or something but most of you probably don't have a 15 inch dick okay I'm sure there's like one outlier in this room I'm not gonna say I'm not going to say you is that stereotypical eye but maybe even racist but I but but basically so yeah think of it like that think of it like could I fuck this girl now of course what's the OP you can also fuck the girl from behind you don't want to be like hey although although pabbie is a number two is proximity okay so many times I see the guys standing like fucking four feet away like he's leaving room for the Holy Ghost at the fucking junior high dance okay no like get right the fuck up in there I mean again understand there's a rhythmic aspect to this you don't want to be like hey what the fuck is that like you know you want to like go in and out you kind of go in now you'll learn to gauge it you'll learn to gauge it but generally I'd say you want to be kind of about like you know about a foot a foot away and then you go and closer as it dictates and then again as you read those social cues of her like dancing up maybe you like back off a little bit again you you can really get an artistry with this with this rhythmic aspect to that to the proximity you can really develop an artistry with this we're kind of like surfing the wave and the guys who are better who've been in this like a long time sure you guys know you can feel it you can kind of you can kind of get it you really cultivate a knack for it right so that's number one number two number one square up icon at number two proximity number three is obviously physical escalation right physical escalation taking things to the next level and personally I know guys have different takes on this and it's really a matter of personal taste I know a lot of guys like Tyler for example he likes to get very physical off the bat you know that's why I'll see him do those crazy things like pick the girl up and spin her around and if you're gonna do that the most important thing is to make it fun right don't make it like you know you're dragging her off to your little rape basket for for for rape so you know you it's got to be fun like you'll notice in all of this videos it's like we we it's like it's like yeah like it's fun so for my personal preference if you will I kind of like to layer it in you know that's why we I will suggest doing that like seven step escalation stack right the the spin has actually we used to be spin handshake but that's like so lame like now we do a different thing I saw you guys no evil Stifler not evil his older brother well we do this other thing I saw him do this the other night we have we did something called claw 5 where you clot you you basically you high-five them and then you claw the girl in like this well I saw him the other night he combined the spin handshake with the claw 5 here you want to come up well surely does oh yeah anyone doesn't matter so basically it's like this so stand right there so you go to the girl like this will it super slow high five yeah and then you know you shake their hand you do the spin handshake first and you spin them into that okay let's do it again real slow so again his spin head shake yay bang hand on the hip here arm over here okay cool thank you big boy out of applauses yeah so anyway but no I thought that was a shit Maidan that's interesting because it's like the thing I like to do with physical with physicality I love to make it dynamic as opposed to static okay so dynamic as opposed to static so that number one number two is that number three spin hug pick him up spin him in a circle set him down with that I always caution guys to do it slowly and controlled you know I had this dude in San Diego and he would do that like he's like some marine he would do it all fucking spastic he was like blocking like shit off cables and shit like coolly like every time you would do this everyone in the vicinity would be like oh my god oh my god a problem a problem like it's like a problem so like if you watch Tyler or Julian in their in their videos do it you know on YouTube he's like you'll see them guys back yeah and he's got this very kind of calm air to him this very relaxed air to him because I think what most guys do not understand about physicality is this even the scrawniest fucking like 110 pound virgin boot camp student could probably kill a woman with his bare hands you know it's like you're dealing with this unpredictable animal that could kill you so you have to look at from the girl's perspective right so do it slow control like dude look I said to this girl the other night I was at the fucking sandwich shop I was walking home I had like a fucking splitting headache I stopped at Walgreens I struck up a conversation with this girl and I she's like it's like um this is kind of a cup look I want to make you a little uncomfortable but not too uncomfortable right because that's what I want to do I want to I want to push the boundaries of that but I don't want to go over it because I want to display social intelligence right I want to display not only social intelligence but most importantly an attunement to her subjective emotional experience that's the biggest thing I see lacking in in guys well it's one of the biggest things I see lacking you guys is there just escalating and they're doing the shit for the sake of doing it they have zero attuma to what the girls giving them and the girl just thinks this guy is just another dude looking for a meat sock to jack off into you know I'm just another fuckin meat sock to masturbate into right you need to show her like treat the girl like a fucking person man like she's a fucking person the thing about this physical description why I like layering it in like that as opposed to just going ham and again as I said it's a personal preference some guys like it some girls really respond well to go in heart off the bat too you know but personally I like it because it's it ratchets it up slowly in such a way that it gives her the opportunity at anytime to put the brakes on it and then it's like kind of like a no harm no foul thing right oh okay no harm no foul and then I'll just go and what do I do I'll then do of course you know just patting on what kind of know it is if it's like a fuck you get the fuck away from me before I call the bouncers that's one thing if it's a runs away physically that's those are hard-nosed okay runs away physically calls for the friends the bouncers whatever that's one thing if it's just like the giggly push away no no or gives you the cheek that's yellow light and what do you do with yellow light very simple forwards haha yeah so anyway I go yeah so anyway like I was saying did it and I back the fuck off and I just talk normal as though nothing out of the ordinary just transpired maybe something vaguely amusing just transpired right huh yeah so anyway as I was saying she fucking hogs the fucking Obamacare whatever you know like I'll just spit the shit like yeah I just got Obamacare it's fucking awesome I'm gonna have all these surgeries I don't even need you know like that rhinoplasty is up first so I I told this guy like rip this off a movie CK I'm like I'm like I'm gonna get a new dick like you know why isn't that a thing why are like old rich white fucks getting new dicks you know they put so much money in like boob jobs and shit like how come like you can't get like you know like like they're on the golf course like yeah bub get my new dick next week yep this 22 year old Puerto Rican track star died in an accident I'm getting this brown beautiful dick right right on right next to mine I'm keeping the old one keeping the old one for a while like I said this to the chick yeah by the way that's another thing I watch a lot of like comedians and stuff like that and I really like especially like to watch khabees before I go out on a date because it puts you in like the right headspace like before I go on a date I like to do what I'm on what I'm driving to the date the day - whatever you want to call it my mind is blank I'm not like thinking you know because I remember back in the day I'd be like quite nervous I'll shit I hope it goes good you know what am I gonna do what's the plan these days it's very blank for a couple reasons one I I've been on hundreds and hundreds of hundreds of them and again what they say experience breeds competence which breeds confidence so I'm just like driving down the fucking thing singing the Eagles or something down the road trying to lose like sitting to the radio or something Bowl shit and I get in there cuz I know I've done this many a time before and secondly I'm I've I put myself in a good headspace before I even leave what does that mean I like watch comedians to get into like that rhythm you know that kind of rhythm of how they speak and that kind of like tonality of that that headspace of like being funny number two make sure I go to the gym that day so I'm like okay I'm feeling good like physically number three I take care of my shit like my bit like if I have any work to do like edit videos what-have-you I take care of that so I'm not thinking I'm some fucking schmuck who's like shirking his duties you know I do a variety of things like that  [Music],O7L0IdkG4yg
howdy y'all how's it going pardon the cowboy vernacular but I'm feeling a little bit like a kind of a badass gunslinger today this year this year so far has been pretty good to me in the dating Department quote-unquote which at this point for me is of course nothing new was one would probably expect from a ten year veteran professional of the game in fact the rate which i hook up with new girls has been extremely consistent over the past few years I would even say shockingly so how consistently it happens not not the volume necessarily but just the consistency you know I've settled into a nice groove that I feel comfortable I feel it's satisfying it's Kontest consistent and perhaps most important of all is sustainable however I remember back in the day Monroe's first coming up I used to have these really dramatic swings between kind of feast and famine I'd be doing really awesome like Bam Bam Bam several girls in a week and then I might slip into some kind of slump where I'd go like a whole month or two without getting laid now at the time I chocked it up to the game you know just being cyclical in nature and if people would ask me about you know with these slumps and so forth I would advise them to take that cyclical nature into account and not look at the peaks and valleys but rather try to look at the big picture and as long as growth is happening overall you're okay but these days you know fast forward to the present barring major life event like a move or death in the family or something or an injury or an illness these cycles have kind of kind of gone away and my shit is for the most part extremely consistent as I said before and it's times like this that I like to sit and reflect what causes these ups and downs in a person's game how you know how can you go from what for weeks at a time rather and not lay a single girl and then all of a sudden bang bang bang bang bang you know you're get on a roll and you'll pick up several and rapid succession so that's what we're going to explore in this video we shall explore it together how special uh-huh so after a lot of careful consideration I think I distilled it down to two major factors and these factors are discipline and intent it's that simple you can have all the techniques and tactics under the Sun of your fingertips you can have 10 million interactions on your belt you know 5 million lays but if you do not have discipline and intent you're going to be home alone with rosy palm and her five sisters as we used to say in the eighth grade with these two elements however you're going to be putting numbers up on the scoreboard pretty fast I mean in fact really fast so let's get right to it what exactly do I mean when I say discipline and intent so what are these what are these concepts mean and how can you apply them immediately to get the kind of results you want so let's examine these individually we'll start with discipline discipline now one training expected to produce a specific character or a pattern of behavior to control behavior resulting from disciplinary training self-control Thank You Siri that is the dictionary definition of discipline always avoid alliteration it's informative of course yes but it does not really illuminate what I'm talking about now does it so let me give you some specific examples from my own life all right you know I've trained myself to be very thorough about how I practice game right there are certain things that I do on a regular basis even if I don't particularly feel like doing them I am disciplined to an extent that I do them regardless so take my phone game please just kidding so take my take my phone / text game each week I will get several numbers from girls either that I pick up out at the bar or the internet all different sources so these are already you know these are immediately added to my large list of what I would call live numbers and these are of course numbers that I have not taken to some sort of conclusion right whether that be positive or negative so I make it a point to go through my list and hit up all of my live numbers each and every day you typically at the same around the same time during the day and so what I'll do is I'll go through my list and I'll examine each individual girl like when was the last time I hit her up when was last time I text her what was the outcome of that how does she rate in priority to the others in the list how hot is the number how hot is the girl and so on and so forth so I'll go through the entire list like this until I settle on the ones that I want to call that particular day so then I go ahead and I execute the process and this takes time forgot like myself I might want to allocate an hour to go through the whole process the point is it is a bit of a chore but nonetheless I do it every single day generally around the same time discipline so do you see how this sort of thing can really kick your game at a high gear there are there's so many ways to apply discipline to your game and it can mean forcing yourself to go out to the club a certain number of times per week it can be something as simple as refusing to let yourself off the hook when you see a girl you're very attracted to an equal difficult set it could mean making yourself push things as far as you can in every single interaction it's called discipline and it's going to change your fucking life but of course that's only half the equation because I have another little friend named intent and when these two fellows get together well oh boy it is a whole new ball game so let me introduce you Ceri intent now aim or purpose so here we have a very simple definition that belies the power of this little concept allow me to elaborate to me it so far as game is concerned intent means desire so think about that word for a second desire so I personally think of a wild tiger another top predator on the Savannah looking at a delicious gazelle off in the distance and how that tiger is immediately and intrinsically motivated on a deep core and fundamental level to get it like imma get it so this absurd metaphor I employ this because that's the most accurate way I can think to describe the way I feel when I'm out there and I actually see a girl that I really want you know I see her I'm like uh-huh right and I just know that nothing on this planet is gonna stop me from getting together with her or at least trying at least stepping as hard as I possibly can and that's intent you feel it in your bones you feel in your root chakra okay that's intent and looking back at those long stretches of time where I'd be going out but not getting any action I realized that in many cases I was lacking intent so I'd be going out just to go out the discipline was there but not the intent I was just kind of going through the motions out of a sense of obligation it was perfunctory routine sometimes kind of from a different angle I'd just be satisfied with my rotation of girls as it was so when you're seeing several uh friends-with-benefits quote-unquote it's quite easy to become complacent now there's no real reason to go out and try to get more there's only so many days in the week when you when it comes down to it as well but uh but after a while of this you know a month or two something my brain would kind of like click and I'd be like whoa dude it's been a while since you know you pulled any new ass oh yeah maybe you're losing it you know you're going down bro and all of a sudden I have a fire under my ass and the next thing you know another banner week for Jeffy and I'm putting names on the scoreboard like it's nobody's business which it isn't except yours I guess and of course the thousands of other people watching on YouTube but it's cool I trust you but this pattern this kind of cyclic up a turn has largely subsided now because rather than indulging in these wild swings I'm sort of like binging to total complacency I tend to keep things going more consistently I don't feel a need anymore to rack up several new Lay's a week all right just a nice trickle which allows for a balance between dating girls for a longer period of time and then also at the same time interacting with new ones another thing that's going to contribute to increased intent is overall health you know back in the day of course I drank super heavily you know ten drinks a night totally shit-faced I was often sick as fat as weak it certainly didn't help my testosterone levels I would assume at least you know but nowadays of course getting older these things become more dear to the heart and so now I monitor my nutrition my supplementation and I exercise quite frequent you want to keep overall test levels optimized to prevent illness you know more like also proactive to pronounce which of course can result in downtime and a lack of intent as well at the end of the day so it's like this discipline is the vehicle for your success and intent is the fuel one will not work without the other if you have discipline but no intent things are going to work out it's like it's like a poem written by a computer there's no soul to it it's in congruent so you might get limited success but it's doubtful again you're just going through the motions on the other hand if you have a strong intent but no discipline well you know then you're yours all over the place your fucking mess Bruce Lee once said be like water and that statement actually applies here you think about it water has no shape and there's no form without a container but when it's focused it can erode Mountains and blast through solid rock and having a disciplined game provides that focus for your intent so as I said before you might be the most skilled player on the block you know Billy badass with tons of experience under your belt but without these two crucial components you're stuck on square one discipline and they're like nitro and glycerin harmless by themselves I'll mix them together and they're explosive so on that note I must sign off for now and remember we talked about here because it's extremely important in my humble opinion it's what makes the difference between a chump and a champ discipline and intent,ONL6KdnN3oE
"well how's this how's this look yeah phenomenal I'm fucking live so the reason for this phenomenal live event that I'm putting on right now is as follows I just I just cracked 50,000 subscribers on YouTube here and what I wanted to do was have a little bit of a little bit of a thank you to everyone who made this possible first and foremost myself but more importantly the people who are actually subscribed so what max suggests that I do here on YouTube and I'm also running the Instagram live here as well anybody who shares my channel helped get this up a little bit more send me a photo after you share it and I'm gonna pick one guy and I'm gonna give that person execute the program totally free of charge as again thank you for all you guys who have put me in this position of you know 50,000 subscribers a bit of a milestone not massive not huge you know and I ain't it fucking Kardashian level but it is something it's very humbling and I feel very grateful to everyone who's subscribed to me over the years between you support me and support what I'm putting out content wise and stuff like that and so again yeah just to give a little something back execute the program all you got to do to get it for free is share my channel and send me a picture of that I'm gonna pick one guy to actually receive execute the program free of charge gratis for zero dollars and zero cents zero dollars and zero cents and you know that is a big theme I think that keeps me going and and doing this you know after 16 years there's a couple reasons number one you know I am very grateful to everyone to be in a position for you you know to bring this information to you and I used to work at a hotel in downtown San Francisco and then I I got essentially transferred out of that I was the manager of the valet parking department a major hotel in downtown San Francisco you can imagine me in like a like a suit saying good evening sir welcome to the Marriott hotel my name is Jeff Howe hell may I assist you how may I assist you this afternoon sir or ma'am and eventually I got transferred to the airport account due to fucking up how did I fuck up showing up late hungover due to pick up often times I would I'd be on picking up seven nights a week and I would then arrive at work either late or severely hungover from sorta sleep-deprived you know from staying up for 5:00 in the morning you go out you pull some girl back home and you know maybe you're up until 5:00 in the morning you know dealing with the LMR or just the sex itself whatever and then you roll into you know rolling to work all fucked up trying to hide behind a clipboard hope that nobody nobody notices you're out of it well over time eventually they will notice and you get transferred to the Siberia the airport account and then from there you know I just give so little fuck pickup was essentially my life at that point then I started working with artists D and at that point you know they just they just fucking I was showing up for where I supposed to be get it I believe it like seven and then I was supposed to leave it around five seven to five six you know I was on salary out of the manager but it eventually got to the point where I show nothing like 10:00 10:30 I take like a two-hour lunch go to the Taco Bell in Burlingame and just like masturbate in the office play solitaire and Hale computer cleaner again they would butterfly knife I have this butterfly knife and what I did with it was I put a I had a label maker at the office and so I would I labeled the I labeled the butterfly knife let her opener so now I could walk around the office with a knife at it people like why do you have this knife why you know this is an unsafe environment but no that's her opener that's her opener and you know well eventually I got fucking fired so what's the point of that story it kind of long the entering story every time when I travel I land back at SFO when I returned home from my travels you would be free tours hot see spook apps and I can look out the left side of the airplane as we land and most of the time I will see the hotel that I used to work at and I just again I'm so overwhelmed with a sense of gratitude just humility at being able to be in a position to help guys in this way and you know I had a student a couple weeks ago and we were you know this another reason why I do it I was out out front of the club it must have been about 12:30 in the morning and I asked my assistant I'm like where's the student he's like oh he's fucking in the van I'm like oh really okay great cool cool sure enough couple minutes later he walks back with the girl in tow and I'm like oh so what happened did you get it done you know cuz oftentimes they'll go to the van and though they'll screw it up at the band I haven't had one kid he he goes to the van and we've given him the spare key and he pulls a goal to the van and I actually see him arrive at the band I'm kind of like watching like a creepy way well maybe a slightly creepy way but you know from a distance just to make sure he can get in and everything so he goes to the van and then the girls with him and he pulls out you know the key and he's like and by the way look this is the key to the van look at that like elaborate shape essentially it's just like a piece of metal with a thinner piece of metal at it this is the key to the actual van there so you start the van yeah it's not very complex so anyway he's got this out and I see him at the door he's like fucking with it fucking with he can't open it I don't mind what the fuck is this guy doing after about 5 min you know 2 or 5 minutes and there's probably not even for like 2 minutes students like you know did the girl Ashley she's like this is boring fuck this I'm going back and she just leaves and I'm like you'll do what happened he's like I couldn't figure out how to how to open the van and he's this 21 year old kid and I'm like show me you have the key right like show me what you were doing like show me what you were doing is it oh I was putting it here and I'm like that's not where the key good that's not at the actual lock he said what is it I'm like that is a Philips screw he was trying to open the door by placing the key into a Philips screw on the side of the doors and I'm like what the fuck he's like I've never I've never seen a car that you actually had to open it with the key before like cuz he's 21 years old like every car he's ever seen it just has like a remote entry like oh shit so so anyway this kit so this kid I'm like did how did it go daddy's again totally went down you know got it on in the van and I was just like so happy he's like he's like he's like your eyes you have just look in your eyes as though it's Christmas morning because for me and I told him this it's like this guy he essentially was this is the reason why I like boot camp because I'm the boot camp we give it as the experience of doing the impossible at least what they thought was impossible at the beginning of the program you know and I asked him on Friday when you were when you came into the van we were doing the pre-brief in your mind what was the percentage chance of you and actually hooking up in this ridiculous man he's like zero right and then sure enough like he couldn't believe a girl would do this he couldn't believe it was possible et cetera et cetera and and you saw the the the lane open up in his mind you know what I mean you saw the lane open in his mind like I can do this this is real people do this it's not Creed I mean maybe a little creepy but you know girls are in when done properly she had a great time was fuckin awesome for everyone involved and you know he's you saw the the possibilities evolve in front of him you know open up in front of him like I can do this normal guys can do this I can learn this I could see myself maybe not being this you know ridiculous pickup superhero guy cartoon character like like Jeff is but you know I I can use this stuff to actually have a significant quantifiable and almost immediate proven on my dating life going for it and for me to run a boot camp and see that happen it's almost like I can go back in time and experience that feeling myself again without you know having to actually suck but yeah cuz I'll never forget the first time I ever actually pulled you know and actually actually had like my first cold approach pickup success lay whatever you want to call it like walking out of the girls house I was just like it's real I was like this shit's fuckin reals like right like you're a wizard Harry and and so for me that's why I could continue teaching boot camp even though like digital products and so forth are you know much more profitable much more of a better return on investment you know boot camp in many ways it's kind of like manual labor you'll hear oh and always say like it's a it's a bad allocation of his time as the actual leader owner of the company to be doing boot camps you know to be schlepping around doing this fuck yes but the reason we do it a couple of reasons you know number one so I can remain empathetic to the concerns of a kid that's just starting out you know and not getting this kind of ivory tower situation where I'm just like oh you know ridiculous why doesn't you why can't he just be cool why do you just be cool like me what the fuck right tough to stay apathetic and like you know in touch with the concerns of the average guy who's just starting out at this stuff but from a more enriching personal standpoint to kind of again experienced by proxy what it's like to have those first breakthroughs again kind of a funny story after that the kid a couple weeks ago when he when he fucking he cut me so he came back home but he came back from the band the girls there the girl standing there with him and I was talking this other girl and then they those two hit it off and then I was like shit fucking happy family and we had a three-way make out and I told the student I was like hey do you mind if you know we get your sloppy seconds I'm gonna through some your girl with this other girl and he's like I don't get the fuck so so kind of like alright we're gonna pull back to the hot tub and so what happened was the girls like alright let's go to your house and I'm like uh well why don't you over there and all show up and meet you there with the car because I figured because the chick didn't know that I was like even related to the student in any way shape or form so I figured like if we went to the van she died wait a minute what the fuck is this I just had sex and Stan with another dude I'm like oh so much just killing the uber so I told my assistant like look I'm gonna you know can you handle the debrief you know we'll do more thorough when tomorrow I'm gonna go threesome in the hot tub I'm gonna take the damn you say oh you can't take the van but why cuz he's that cuz the other students in there right now getting laid as well and my holy shit so that's that was the first that had never happened completely unprecedented where one student hooked up with a man and then another student hooked up in the band well I'm like fuck least I gotta go get my computer out of there you know I don't - leave that shit here overnight because I figured I can just leave the band get in morning so I go in there and I'm like knock knock knock and the other student at his door were not in there yet so I get my shit out but as I'm exiting they come in and one of the funniest thanks - so I was like oh hey guys so let's we going back at the club and then so the other student handled his business in there but when I notice I expected the man would be like tossed but when I get in there the fucking the previous student has actually like made the bed it's all like cleaned up like fucking housekeeping like addcom I'm like holy shit this guy what a considerate young man and I didn't even see the time usually like you know the like tossed economy or some bullshit like and it got her so I asked him the next day I'm like maybe put the condom he said oh I took it in my pocket I like carefully closed it and took it in my pocket back to the club to dispose of in the rubbish bin I'm like what so let me get this straight so basically you were walking around in the club with a small baggie of your own sperm yeah man I mean fuck you and honestly I just throw that shit in the gutter because I I pay so much fuckin street-cleaning parking tickets these motherfuckers are gonna earn their keep that's just kind of my take on it you know I'm not really big on littering or anything like that but you know they're gonna charge me fucking $73 fucking street-cleaning they're gonna fuckin earth or goddamn money well anyway um like I said just wanted to welcome everyone who's new to this livestream the reason I'm doing it just crack 50k subscribers on my youtube rst Jeffie here pretty happy about that you don't know if you did reason for that I was of a stagnant at like maybe like 45 for quite some time but you know if you've been following for a while I've been very very consistent I'm like I'm doing this whole Taco Tuesday and releases and I've got about 15 about three months worth in the can and I'm recording every day or every week rather and so my intention is to be really consistent with that because like I said you know it's all about staying in touch with people staying in touch like keeping the ear to the ground not being this like ivory tower guy who's entitled entitlement is fucking death especially as you get older you know entitlement complacency and you know I've just been cranking and he's consistent of at least I'd say for about two or three months now two and a half months and just to see in that couple of months just the increase in subs you know it shows it works shows it connects people are into it whatever maybe you're not you're not fuck you kill yourself but okay that's hate speech on YouTube now demonetized but uh why the intention is to keep doing it and then you know back to the first love making these videos if you will sothanks purpose of this for as far as your concern is I'm giving you the opportunity to win execute the program my magnum opus of online game the highly repeatable system that I cultivated over a period of years essentially an algorithm to get you laid off the internet as easy as ordering post mates or GrubHub or uber eats I guess is a hot shit right now so share this channel share my channel on any of your social media send me a pic and I'm gonna select one guy to get the program gratis free of charge and you think max for alerting me to that you know what's interesting to you because max he's uh his brand easily exploded in a really short time frame and that's because you know he's got his ear to the ground near the ground so to speak in terms of social media in ways that said I'm 42 years old and when I started doing this shit you did I was already like well into my pickup career with YouTube started like in 2008 and you know I didn't even really get my channel go until 2010 and so you know with the rise of different platforms you know they give sam chat insta etc etc I just didn't want to be the elder that like you know who the grandpa who doesn't know how to fucking send an email and so I'm interestingly enough like I'm not you know I'm not as so egocentric or arrogant as to believe that you know I'm the old guy know best and so I really went to max and I said yo teach me your ways young youngster young nephew and you know so I'm talking to him pretty much on the daily for the past several months just about this this stuff getting tips you know tricks tips cants to get more engagement and stuff like that and I think it's really important to stay connected to younger people as you get older and not buy into I mean it's good to have like obviously friends your own age you know it's good to have older mentors as well but you've got to stay in touch with kind of like that youthful energy where they're willing to try something willing to try something stupid that seems kind of like dumb to you maybe you've tried it before and you think you know better but you know you know I think that we all remember the story of Owen who had gone to live in Hawaii for several years and when he came back to Los Angeles his game had kind of really fallen off a cliff I remember the first time you went out with Alex go to old Alex he was like Alex like I met I went out with Helen and I think he's testing me I'm like what do you mean what do mean he's testing he's like I went out with him and he sucks like oh no no he actually sucks he was like what like yeah he's just been out of it for so long so what did he do the classic story there you know he hooked up with Julian he found Julian and you know took him under his wing and Julian was the guy that would push him back in the Hollywood clubs back to get his game back to where it was before you know so if you are an older guy and you're kind of feeling that complacency it can be going to connect and and kind of put aside those feelings of superiority mr. know-it-all did there done that and kind of helped yourself to be open at least to the ideas of a younger business partner younger wing to somebody younger who can kind of lend you some of that that energy some of that fresh set of eyes mentality if you will so anyway I don't want to belabor the point here too much for me an or around too much however I got a fucking AC joint separation I know if you know what that is anyone in here is uh into fitness and so it sucks it's another thing sucks about getting a little shit just breaks no fucking reason should just break Sammy's the dick still works right so it's all that really matters so anyway how often a chromo acromioclavicular yeah that's what it is it's called um maybe I'll run through some of these oops run through some of these comments here  should I read mean comments seems to be very popular right  no faff is war against the balls war against the balls okay toss salad I'm nicknaming myself after an air conditioner the the pocket do ya man somebody's story that's another reason why I keep doing this boot camps just like the fucking stories dude like you know honestly like left to my own devices on the weekend I'll be like oh you know just sit around or go out and just get drunk or something it's like I'm boot camp I remain sober ish you know at least I'm getting like annihilated to the point of like incoherence but it's just these crazy fucking stories like who would have thought you know that this shit would what happened I had a uh I had a student in Dallas recently a couple weeks ago last yeah I guess couple weeks ago who uh was like openly ingesting cocaine the entire time I'm like okay I mean probably not the best but what are you notice the customer's always try the fuck dude shit yeah anyway you know it's funny to I'm actually uh I'm actually at fuck Jeff okay that's a good one that's it that's what I like to see honesty boot camp in Portugal am I allowed to come to Canada yes I'm allowed loud knock on wood right  will attract chicks though with the coke well here's the thing about coke you know it's one of its one of like those things where you think gods played a trick you know gods like oh I'll make this drug and it makes women horny but for men it makes their dick not work right so yeah you know kind of one of life's ironies there isn't it ah lordy Lordy lordy Lordy lordy need to upgrade the microphone Burt yeah you know this is just I'm just like doing this really kind of improvisational II it's just this is just like my fuckin iMac monitor like the standard mic and shit like that I just wanted to throw this together like I said I just cracked 50k today also on histogram I think I'm at like fourteen thousand nine hundred eighty two or something like that so I'll probably crack 15k on Instagram today which again now these are like moderate numbers would relatively but you know it's little milestones so again share my channel rst Jeffy on any of your social media send me a picture that and I'm gonna select one guy on Max's recommendation to win execute the program I'll probably announce it over the next couple of days you just set them to me at JL AIX at real social dynamics calm or you could DM them to me  we made a rule no weed before going out because then we shit then we shit oh okay I

neck hair shit I get and it's gotten to the point where it's like not even a beard it's just like a neck like literally like a collar of fur just all around the neck and so yeah you know I was actually at the fucking karaoke bar the other night and this weird dude Yanni who he's like this like flamboyant gay nerd is not Jessie I am telling you this I think he's Greek I want to say Jessie I

starting to get those it's kind of cool you know I have a couple of them and when I found the first one it was like a pet I was like a little pet but now there's a lot of little pets growing no my intention is not to diet or anything like that it could be putting these like chemicals on my fucking face and head so no I'm going to you know retain that little salt and pepper because you know the old saying just because there's snow on the roof don't mean there a fire in the other oh you fucked my sister and I watched domo arigato mr. Roboto Domo hot tub hot tub is very wonderful and I would highly highly encourage everyone to get hot tub they just go right to it man they just go right fucking to it and they just go right to it man provided you have a traction obviously you don't want to just be rolling up and be like hello lady hot tub although that would probably work too to be honest yeah probably that would probably work more than you think actually hot tub sex man I don't even know what's next man what is this granny's and guilt game granny's a GILF case so yeah I did I talked to my buddy James the other day and I told him I was like dude I went out with a fucking old lady the other day and he's like how old and I was like my age so to me that's like a fucking granny GILF shit like no I'm not into a dude fucking gross okay usually I don't like to hang out with them I don't like to talk to them I don't like their mindset I don't like the worldview I don't like their demeanor okay I'm snot into it man you know my wheelhouse is like from like 2021 to like 27 that's kind of where I operate I'd say most of the time I mean but you again you know there's no the heart wants what the heart wants so if I do you know if I do encounter a girl a woman a grown-ass woman who's you know my age and I find her attractive I do it but I just you know it's just not I don't tend to connect on a personal level with those people maybe I'm here mature that's what this girl said the other day is it maybe you're immature like oh you want to tell me some more or want way got me here and then she's like I'm match me yeah no dude I hardcore fitness so I did I did hook up with a hardcore feminist the other night and  you know she apparently it went down perfect it was like a wonderful time seamless seamless pickup wonderful time she I didn't believe she suggested we go back she's staying over we hooked up in the morning I gave her coffee and then I guess she saw my Instagram and deleted me and then I went to the same bar the following week and I was banned so I guess you must have like called up the bar and said you have this creep this cretin attending your your bar and of course they looked at front of my media or what have you and you know shit happens man but you know what it's gonna be recognized it's good to be back niced at age forty forty to get old for - anyway um jets but you can pick up some burger have you ever gotten beaten up without gaming I have not have beaten up without gaming I did I did beat a dude the other the other night actually who was who assaulted the student and I that doesn't fly with me you know and then this person needed to be assaulted in kind as a self-defense measure and taken to the floor and have his face placed onto the concrete and  it was uh you know self-defense you know just enough again judicious use of force you're not allowed to beat them further you know as soon as the threat has been defused you know taken care of you stop you know and this is not like some ego thing I just wanted to prevent him from you know injuring the student and the whole time I was just concerned about my  jeggings I did I was like I hope I remember literally during the whole incident I was like I hope my hope please God don't let my jeggings rip for the love of God please please don't let my jeggings rip and and sure enough they did not rip and you know your times were had by all you know things too I've been beaten severely and you know what's not that bad you know whatever you're pretty resilient we saw him whoo-hoo shit man  shit do you ever cool your ballsack no you know I actually I I blow dry my ballsack each each day I dry my ballsack after getting out of the shower because you know you you don't want to have moisture down there there's there's a whole host of issues that could result I want a nice dry ball sack you know each day as I begin the day and I want to say tallest woman you've been with six foot nine was the tallest woman I've been with she was in the Guinness Book of World Records tied for I believe ninth call this woman in the world I also did hook up with not I don't know if this is technically a midget but she was four foot nine so that's kind of my range is four foot nine to six foot nine and you know kind of run the gamut kind of run the gamut Jeffie are you lobotomized or I don't know this use me for sex I feel like I'm lobotomize I could be vasectomized one day I don't know I'm open to the idea of having a young child to be my my unpaid labor around my house to like check the fucking hot tub chemicals you know do I need it for my fucking dad when I was a youth and the cycle will continue free labor to fucking clean up the goddamn garden and clean my pubes out of the hot tub Sun clean my pubes out of the haha check the chemicals check the fucking pH you know the chlorine and again the cycle continues cycle continues should I be a flight attendant flattest fattest woman you've been with probably like 350 I'd say I mean dude I've done the shit all I just done it all dude you know uh from the top to the bottom oldest woman probably like 43 I'd say three-fitty lol yeah that she's like six for each of her tits was bigger than my head I mean that was a long time ago now you know these days I'm like a lot more justly just starting you have your types more I guess dialed you know what I mean you you get it more your preferences become a lot more defined you know 350 kilos what is 350 kilos let's probably let my like 600 pounds or so shit whoo shit do you like being pegged by women I mean no I mean I guess I'd have to be I'm like a lot of rough like maybe like a math or something I might be into it I don't know do you okay this is interesting  do you prefer game in the New Age with all the tech or back in the day I mean look you know the big games game right I think that a lot of the so-called tech from back in the day was how to kind of put this it was kind of like a finger pointing at the moon right like we were so focused on the tech that we were looking at the principles behind the tech right and the mindsets that would lend themselves to behaviors when express ideas that the tech was trying to get at of their own accord right so that's why with hot seat we try not to just teach technique but we also really want to get into the principles behind it and get people to internalize those so they'll be able to go out and do the stuff they see on you know art in fields and do it themselves that night even if they don't remember every little you know nuance or every little verbage that was employed by the instructor right so we want guys to be able to come up with their own stuff that achieves the same ends as a lot of the techniques or lines or bits that you see instructors do right hmm are you into track are you into traps and you know I saw I follow this one youtuber her name is Blaire white and she's a trap I suppose a tranny a trans woman and she addressed this question are traps gay and the answer was yeah they're kind of gay traps are kind of gay so I guess you know that you know I take her word for it she obviously knows more than about it to me so yeah I guess that's that when are you gonna retire 50 60 I'm never I'm never going to retire I'm never ever gonna retire when I did you see self-help people we we don't retire we die do you understand we die when my dad retired he was dead within two years you need something to keep you engaged you need something to keep keep you going you know or else you can become like my fucking neighbor we call him grandpa parking police this old dude like literally all he does is watch the parking on the block and if you don't park right he comes over and rings the doorbell and yells at ya it's like if you want to be grandpa fucking parking police no no I want to be like creepy fucking  60 year-old club creeper it's gonna be me bitch grandpa steal your girl Griffith grandpa steal yo girl grandpa parking ya not grandpa parking please grandpa steal your girl how many sex tapes did you start in well I was never a big fan of sex tapes but you know with all this me to shit maybe I have some have a camera in my fucking room now surveillance so I don't become the next Aziz Ansari he was a cretin he ate my pussy and I felt really disturbed should I become a flight attendant fight become a fucking flying tan okay become a fucking flight attendant this guy seems that he's asked us about 15 times in this chat here tried to come a pleasant yes become a flight attendant become a flat tenants travel the world see the world serve the world the peanuts give them the peanuts have you ever been tricked by a tranny again I already addressed this there is no being tricked by a tranny there's no trick you understand you fucking know at least I would know I would fuck it up right there will be no trick you understand if I were to ever hook up with a tranny would be of my own free will there be an informed decision do followers affect game you know that's a hole actually the Instagram thing I know loops done a bit on it toddler's done some stuff on and Max has done some stuff on it I'm gonna release a video on I I did a talk about it winter summit and again I'm not the best guy at it but I'm like I said always interested in learning the new shit and it seems to be it's quite powerful in its own way and it's alright when done correctly and it's not really about the followers per se it's more about giving them a way to see your life right to like see this guy he's a normal person he's not a fucking psycho like he has friends he does normal things he's not gonna put my head on a fucking stick in his front yard cry and it's funny because I told my buddy James I was like yeah blah blah blah you know get their hits duh don't get the number get the in stuff he's like why like well you know if you don't fucking bad night then you could maybe hook up in the future he's like but that's the future like literally that was his that was verbatim his response that's the future like he couldn't even comprehend because again this is a guy he's very in the moment he's very present which helps him in many ways it's also kind of detrimental in some way so and he does have a point you know like why not just pull that night you should always be going for the same a night call but again girls that were on the fence they have bad logistics their friends were there girls that you would never see again in a million years by sending him some fucking ASCII text message the next day nice to meet you there well now you can roll Metiria so they can see you have a cool life you qualify without qualifying in a way and you know as for those girls that are on the fence or again that bad logistics you never see again in a million years the insta is the way to go right it's the way to actually give yourself a fighting chance and yeah he's gonna work every time absolutely not but it's certainly gonna be a lower flake rate than fucking straight-up number clothes so um it should another flight attendant  you can exchange instant and just pull the insta is just commonplace yeah but as we've seen if I exchange in stand that Paul they see me the next day and have a freak out and call the bar and say your pickup artist is at your bar you need to ban his ass I mean most people are going to have this this issue though what do you think GT w do you die you know what's interesting here's a thing I probably gonna I'm probably gonna do like a promo for 480p as well at some point I don't know or a resonator I think because resonator anniversary is coming up so probably do the nice little promo thing for that but the interesting thing that you notice and I just saw the other day Facebook is now doing a dating service they're basically Facebook is doing its own version of tinder in hell which you know this is what we've been training for gentlemen if you're on the execute to program this is what we've been training for the moment that Facebook metastasized into tinder so but anyway so yeah that's pretty crazy so again the same the same fucking principles apply execute the program I really think execute program is my best work that I've ever done and pick up thus far at least because it really is encyclopedic and I'm that is kind of like my area of expertise Ryan I'd say like if you're looking like every every pick up guy they've got like different areas that they do they face excel at on your Luke's obviously social circle etc etc like you know me I've always kind of been more in the humor side of things the verbage side and then also online was always it was a buffoon I was getting laid off online back and fucking from MySpace dude from Friendster which was before MySpace on Yelp I was getting laid off yelp.com writing reviews and shit so I've always been really good at it or Mo's had a lot of success with it but I decided to codify it so I spent three years of my life just fucking researching researching researching swiping and then researching and kind of went down a hole you know down a rabbit hole for a while and didn't disappear you know disappeared from reality and then when I came back put together execute the program I wanted it to be if the next program I put out is going to be on that same level of encyclopedic details right cuz again like a big thing for me I don't want to like these guys the fucking HQ they're always I get out there what's your next product what's your next product I'm like dude I'm not gonna just like churn out some fucking bullshit you don't anything we'll come on turn out some bullshit my cash but I'm like no dude fuck this shit like I'm not I'm not into that the next thing is gonna be fucking dope it's in the works I don't want to talk about it honestly right now but it's gonna be something quite special but anyway long story short now with this Facebook becoming the new tinder face tinder tinder book whatever the fuck they're if they're calling and I don't even get Facebook dating well you know these principles are as useful now as they ever were you know the algorithm of how to get laid off fucking Internet as useful as it ever was and so it's very nice that I can use this wonderful milestone and 50,000 subscribers to offer this again this is what kind of contest whatever you want to call it this opportunity to get execute the program for free all you got to do and there's the last someone to say this cuz I'm gonna wrap it up here it's been about 50 minutes and I got to go and actually believe it or not I actually do have to go clean the pubes out of the hot tub before a trivia night white person trivia night tonight so so yeah all you gotta do share my channel RSD Jeffie send me a screenshot of the share and i'm gonna select one guy to get execute the program both free and i'll announce this by the end of the week so or yeah by literally like by the end of the week so anyway um thanks it's been fun I've enjoyed this god bless you guys god bless america thanks for the 50k and I'll see you again on Taco Tuesday",Or3gjBuVe4o
what's up this your boy Jeffy I'm here to rot Oh Ontario and I'm thinking hard about the game today real hard and no that is not a vulgar euphemism about my dick uh-huh so as we all know this game requires several parallel focuses you have to focus on your interstate you have to learn things on the tactical level you have to have a thorough understanding of the social matrix and how it operates so you know where you are in any given interaction and where you need to go and within the framework of these focuses there are also several other areas you need to be concerned with you know this could be like say your phone game your open game your end game etc etc etc so you have to accept that you cannot learn all these things at once so you concentrate on one area at a time until you've wrapped your head around it and you've got to cut a small chunk out so to speak and sometimes this means that your game is going to suffer in the short term but often you have to go backwards in order to move forward now other times you might revisit an area that you'd previously mastered and discover that the experience that you've gained in the interim allows you to gain deeper insights than ever before you know things you just didn't see the first time around because you lacked the reference points so today I'd like to revisit the so-called rapport game and what that means is of course forming a strong emotional connection with your intended girl and this has long been regarded as one of the central tenets of game in order to have a successful seduction you must build a certain level of trust comfort and connection with the other person again when I first got into the game I learned how to do this pretty well I mean good enough at least to serve my purposes but after a few years passed I decided to look at it with a fresh set of eyes and some of the things that I discovered were difficult to put into words okay these are abstractions that I simply would not have been able to articulate prior to this and I guess what I want to really get into specifically here is how to develop empathy with your target how to build how to build a very real communion with the girl in a relatively short period of time and this is important for a couple of reasons first you need to be able to build that connection in order for the girl to feel comfortable with you escalating physical contact and secondly when you devote when you develop this rapport it's going to give you vital clues about what's going on in the girl's head and what you need to do to progress so let's get right into it might seem a little new agey at times but bear with me as it's all based on empirical evidence from the field so first off you need to be attuned to the girls emotional subjective emotional experience even while you're talking in other words you'll be aware of her feelings and in fact the feelings of everyone in the group even when they're not talking remember this game is all about emotions and has very little to do with logic so you must perpetuate this cascade of good feelings and everyone involved in the interaction at all times and this means a careful calibration and having a keen perception of how people are reacting to you now take note this doesn't mean they should seek a particular reaction to your words or that you should attempt to micro manage other people's perception of you far far far from it it just means that you should pay attention to how you're affecting others emotionally and actually make constant small course corrections based on that information so the thing is many people will just go in and they just blast what they call like a trek material their looks bring it blithely around and paying very little to the reactions of the other person and it gets worse okay some people especially beginners are gonna use like an imaginary target when they use all these learn all these lines and so for us they're like rehearse them of course the so-called natural game has been the dominant paradigm for several years now but I'll still see this from time to time and the problem with this is that they carry this method over into their interactions and they actually become unaccustomed to working with actual living people so you look at this from the girls perspective right I can only imagine how torturous it must be for these people when I see some dude who's like overly like running it's like cringe-worthy I can barely even look at it these guys who are mechanically just spitting the without regard for the feelings of the other person are very they're separated from the very person they should be in closest relationship with so be very very careful to avoid this method it'll eat into you and it can be quite difficult to eradicate okay now secondly it's important to avoid stiff mannerisms and body language and to keep your expressions loose and dynamic so seeing is how expression of interstate is all important to a successful pickup the aspiring pickup artist must strive to develop and utilize all the tools at their disposal from body language to vocal projection and so forth and so on okay so you should take great pains to avoid the mistakes of the incompetent player with his stiff face stiff body dull voice speech without inflection you know is he like shuffles through the club it's generally just like all-around painful mannerisms okay you want to be loose you want to be moving to the rhythm okay expressive of your own internal flow motion creates emotion and that's why in the club as I've said before you'll never see instructors standing with our you know arms folded value scanning back and forth you know we're bopping our head to the music we're singing we're yelling gibberish etc we're priming our physiology for approach we're being expressive and we draw her in with that okay so up till now we've only talked about the external physical processes of communication but there is of course another important aspect which is inner invisible and perhaps even spiritual and what I mean said I can feel it and these are these invisible currents that we use to communicate with each other by which we become attuned to the other person's inner emotional experience and of course the prevailing theory here is that this happens by a means of a system of mirror neurons which fire when we witness another person experience in an emotion or performing an action and gives us an equivalent experience in our own consciousness so when we're calm and quiet this process of state transfer it's barely perceptible but when we're in a highly emotional state this phenomenon both on the giving and receiving ends becomes much more definite and tangible so the other day I was at the taco shop and I saw this little scene between some dude and his girlfriend apparently they'd had a fight and so they were sitting at a table but like as far apart from each other as possible and the girl was pretending she didn't even see him but she was doing this in a way to like attract his attention and the guy sat there motionless and he just like watch her the sort of this like this pleading look he was like trying to catch her eye so he could guess what her feelings might be but the pissed-off chick just like ignored him and finally he caught her glance like just briefly as he actually like turned for an instant in his direction and instead of consoling him this actually depressed the to hood more than ever so in this communication there were no words no facial expressions no gestures no actions and that is direct immediate communion in its purest form it's like this underground river that flows continuously under the surface of both words and silences and forms an invisible bond between the people communicating it's ephemeral yet very real so when I'm interacting with a girl and my emotional acuity is sharp an interesting thing happens I basically just own the set looks like I can see five moves ahead you know Tim used to call this the bubble of love or engaging with hyper focus and what I'm doing this the girl's friends can even come up and try to pull her away and she'll ignore them so on my end it just feels like nothing exists except me in the girl and the entire world disappears so you can feel the emotional wavelength until you asleep emanating for both them and yourself that's when you achieve that hyper focus so you're giving out and absorption is going to be much stronger much keener and much more palpable and of course this must all be done without unnecessary tension or trying as this would of course end up sub communicating insecurities and low value so it's not a physical exertion it's a greater interactivity and of course in everyday life we don't typically need this intense emotional acuity although it can certainly be helpful but in a pickup situation it's an absolute necessity and it's not simple to attain this state of hyper focus purposefully as some sort of tactic you just kind of tend to hit it and things and things flow from there it's like a siphon when you use it to drain a container you know you just suck the air out once and then the water flows out by itself so the same thing happens here you know you give the signal you open the way and the currents will pour out that's all about expressions so anyway it's going to kind of cold out here so that's all you're going to get out of me today so tune in next time I got some awesome queued up and you will love it and I will in-turn love you all right peace

yeah a singlet is that what they call that shit here we call it a wife-beater  how many flights have I been on oh well I have gold status on United so oh very few I don't I'm not there to trick-or-treat with dudes man I probably probably been in like maybe two or three over that simply try to like to view the situation well I do stuff spiders I don't I've only been like two or three fights over the course of 15 years um I I don't really know why I think I don't I don't think people want to I think it's probably a combination of venue selection I don't go to places where there's like thugs you understand because again what's the look being a tough guy is the consolation prize for being a loser because if you get in fights oh shit you probably have some charges you can't travel shit like that like I'm very circumspect about that and you gotta understand too a lot of the time when I'm out of the club I met work is that a good look for me like I've got clients they're paying thousands of dollars to be like fighting oh no the destructor got in a fight oh the cops came in structure got the fund that's not a good look you know I'm saying it's not professional so no I don't like getting to fucking fight all the time all the all the fucking time all the fucking time he is quick to fucking hit a motherfucker and he will brutally fucking pummel motherfuckers but you know what dude um this actually is a true story I have a friend I had a friend named Trey and he was killed on New Year's Day this year in a fight that he got into after after the club fell they got a fight fell hit his head he's dead so don't do it again I'm not there that's why it has I said you know I was like dude I'm just poor around for Trey one of the few guys that I can actually wing with in San Francisco you know and and now he's fucking dead because who knows you know he was these rambunctious fellow as well you know what I mean he's always looking to start shit and stuff like that now he's fucking dead and for what you know doing about some bitch like stupid man like so again I I don't I don't do that I'm not a fighter I'm not good at that shit I'd never have been I have a lot of friends who were good at violence I wish I was good at violence sometimes like the thing is I have friends they find they kick the guy's ass like if I fought somebody I'd probably like get beat and then probably arrest it as well like these guys like they buy it they they win they get away like that guy I'd be arrested in the hospital like ya know yes so the type of war how often does it happen to you okay these days tug of war I would say basically the less reactive guy wins so when I'm in there I'm not talking to the guy I'm not addressing him I'm barely even looking at it my only goal is to get the girl's attention back on me right I don't make little quips about the guy I don't joke at him I don't try to tool him if he tries to tool me I will tool him back gently with the bare minimum required and usually let again I've been doing this a very long time so pretty much anything they say I have heard before so I always have like a better answer it's like a dialogue tree from like a game or something like I've heard it all before so I have like responses to everything so if the guy does try to get to me unless he's really good somes you see that and I like that actually usually when I see a guy who's like better than me or like like who could really like Duke it out toe-to-toe with me oftentimes we'll just abandon the girl and start hey man you're cool like let's hang yeah you know because it's rare that you meet a guy that that's that actually has that skill right but usually if it's just some random dote and he's like trying to tool me it'll only take a couple of back-and-forth for him to realize if I continue down this path he's gonna make me look really dumb they'll usually shut up but then like again all you want to do is get the girl's attention back now what do you do if you can't and the girl has the attention on the guy what would you do  yeah I mean basically there's Deneb right II was you know Tyler would probably pick her up and carry her away but again that's again a high-risk high-reward thing I'll probably just say something like that I got this from Julianne actually and this what Julian will do he'll be like hey my friend cut me my friend and it'll drag the girl away come meet my friend and I will just go to some random person that he doesn't even know like hey this is my sister this is my girlfriend like oh hi sister girlfriend okay anyway blah blah and then just continue blabbing at the girl so this puts the guy in a bad position because now he's got to be like the follow guy but again it kind of depends who it is if it's her friend then obviously don't want to toggle blow out the fucking male friend that's not gonna be a good look okay cuz it's she's gonna you know you're some Rando Rando commando she's gonna value that guy's opinion of her more highly than I believe it was some random dude unless she's like really and you are really drunk or something but in which case if that happens what I'll typically do is I'll I'll get the phone number and I'll probably try to follow up later because unless I'm traveling or something which I'll try to pull hard but the thing is if she's there with a girl a female friend the girl is more likely if she leaves with you the girls more likely afterwards to be like yeah high five you go girl get that D or whatever right where's the guy might be like Oh Oh Wendy uh yeah she left with some dude the other I know my god you know more judgmental about it again so it could be that it could be the fucking boyfriend if it's the actual bona fide boyfriend I'm not there to like ruin relationships are you crap like that you know I'll basically all like oh hey huh cool anyway I'll I'll find out if it's real okay and there's different ways to do that basically I'll get a feeling it you know if the girl is telling me this is my boyfriend if it's the guy just saying it I'm gonna try to get confirmation but if it's if it's real I'll be like oh shit yeah sorry anyway so yeah blah Oh bullshit bullshit bullshit yeah I'm just here I'm from San Francisco cool yeah keep her for you sir where's good to eat run effort Oh sick okay well hey okay guys have a great night boom poof and leave and then the thing is later on in the night I might be pulling another girl and I'll pull past them and they'll be like oh it's that dude hey dude done it under there right they might even buy you a drink so I'm not there to make like social errors in the club mystery used to say treat the club like a hundred set not like a bunch of like two and three cents in your mind there's an ecology right so if you really want to get the girl the boyfriends right there though there's different ways to do it I mean it depends true there might be it might be a trouble in paradise situation and you know if she hates the boyfriend she's there with him she wants an excuse like either piss him off start a fight with him whatever which case I'll pull her to the van and fuck her and release her back to the wild quickly I have several examples that but if you want to get it she's like still there with him I'll be like yeah tell him I'm gay I'm gay and then I'll wait for like you know a moment was attention is diverted and I like covertly get the number down down there and then hook up later and again if it's just some Rando just ignore his ass again the less less reactive wins okay Green turquoise whatever so basically been going on date game oh just like applying different things I'm kind of accused of techniques and principles and trying so much principles are tied to a day and I kind of go not debrief I kind of write notes of what I should do like more sexual intent otherwise name or this or that yeah there's no techniques there's no like Oh escalate board closest always kind of like being that more natural and less technique so is there a balance there should be more like you know well the thing is you need to know the mechanics yeah right you can't just be like oh here I am my I am so present hovering across the water come suck my dick now like that's not gonna happen you need to understand what are the waypoints of an interaction and how do you smoothly move that along what do you do when this happens what do you do when this happens again the mechanics thing cuz I don't want to like I don't want like openers or lines I want like punches anyone know what I'm gonna tell them pottsy tip on Saturday literally literally like dude again basic mechanics are easy to learn right it's easy to learn difficult to implement sometimes and unless you have experience with it right experience breeds confidence which breeds confidence so again I if that's your issue is the techniques that's it's easier to learn than the you're well-positioned I'd say all right we'll do one more one more so yeah here classes so we cherish how do you avoid I feel like cherish mode meaning you hook up with a girl and then you don't want to game anymore you want to be with her yeah okay so here's the thing guys hook up with a girl you're gonna go out and especially guys are on bootcamp I say look I would encourage you to not take not get into a long-term relationship for at least six months after the boot camp why you need time to internalize this stuff if you go out and you get to relate because you're gonna you're gonna get laid if you go out you know it's not that shit ain't that fucking hard man this isn't fucking rocket surgeries on brain science you're gonna go out and you're gonna you're gonna get laid in you like enough to have sex with her you're probably gonna like err enough to continue seeing her again but here's the problem with that these guys get into your relationships and they haven't internalized the concepts yet so what happens well I see them again in 18 months and I'm like oh shit another boot camp ready to take to the next level huh yeah okay we go to the fucking club they suck like what the fuck is is why do you suck well you see I got into the relationship after the program and then we were together for a year and then broke up and now I'm back at square one okay so look the thing is how do you avoid that getting into cherish mode huh interesting well I'd say basically it's just you got to hold yourself to a standard you're trying to learn the stuff so you want to you want to like resist getting into like a monogamous relationship until you feel you're at a level where you've internalized it now why why do you want to do that well it's going to make you a better boyfriend when you're in the relationship because you're not going to be feeling that scarcity factor right so again if you just rush into the relationship you're not gonna be as present because you're gonna always feel that that there's that power dynamic where she has more power than you where if she left she can easily hook up with someone again you again it might take it might take a while so for me like dude I've been with my girlfriend for about years now and the thing is I can go out with her in beasts hose or I can stay home and watch fucking Game of Thrones I don't care like either one of those is fine to me because I'm really comfortable econ fidence right I'm like very very confident in the relationship and here's the thing why does pickup also make you a better boyfriend I think that what pickup teaches you everyone wants like they they think that they're learning the girl that they want I think what pickup teaches you when you sleep with a lot of girls it teaches you what you don't want right cuz you'll sleep with girls you'll get with them and you'll find you'll get your relations to them and you'll find out we're not compatible for X reason so for example like over the years I found out like certain like things that annoy me you know what my girlfriend asked me the other day she's like why are you with me and I said do you know why I'm with you I thought about it I thought seriously about it for about a minute I go because you don't annoy me that's like the highest compliment I can give you don't annoy me I am very easily annoyed do you know what I mean and I don't take any fucking shit and she knows like literally like if she's like anytime I'll bring up like a serial oh she cuz there's a serious issue in the relation of like look you know I'm not gonna change I mean not fundamentally because I'm happy with myself so I you know maybe we should break up no I hate to do that it's not this is not an ultimatum you understand this is like it's in this in the in the service of health mental health because I've been in many relationships where we stayed together when we knew and like the thing is once it starts to get into that stage of acrimony it's just like increasing acrimony and entropy until finally you can't stand anymore than it's like this huge breakup it's like when I sense that shit happening I'm willing to walk yeah would I be upset yes absolutely I'd probably be really upset for like a month or two you know but whatever I'm willing to take that because I'm not willing to waste any more of my highly highly precious and limited time on this planet right because here's the thing that is the fucking only commodity you have in this game it's not gold respect your ego any of the shit the only commodity you have is your time your fucking time even the poem is the time you're spending in this room your life is slowly ticking away hopefully you know this is like been help more beneficial to you than say going and eating Nando's or some shit right like something which I like Nando's don't get me wrong but I'm saying you know it's a you know maybe you're learning something but again ultimately you got to decide how you want to spend your time and you have to you have to respect your time so that's the thing I'd say don't be afraid to get into quite a go cherish mode because that'll teach you something to do you know I'm saying I've had mo times where I've been like monogamous I've been times where I've been like full player I've also had times where I'd like more nesting mode etc etc you're gonna learn off from all-in how old are you probably like what 23 or something like that 20 yeah so again you got you got your whole life to learn the shit and understand whether you're learning it whether you're applying yourself mentally to learning how to like socially interact with you in a better way or you're not the times gonna fuckin pass anyway you know I'm sayin so whether you're in the gym or you're not the time is gonna pass you might gonna be in the fucking chair,PzNLVfSvfDc
[Music]  [Music]  Jeffie hey what's up guys this is jeff AKA obama AKA the president of the galaxy coming at you from amsterdam today to bring a very special video blog so we just capped off the first stop in the Jaypee hot seat world tour did a great boot camp here and you know helped helped a lot of people here helped a lot of guys I get the success with the women that they want and deserve all up in that ass okay so I'm boot camp though I you know thing came up this weekend that comes up quite a lot it's actually quite common issue with a lot of different guys that take program and so I'd like to talk about that with you guys today and what that is it's a little concept that we like to call the baby tiger syndrome okay what does baby tiger syndrome well this is basically what happens when you get a guy who is either unfamiliar with or you know uncomfortable with acting in a masculine dominance polarity okay and that encompasses a wide range of behaviors everything from escalation to just general attitude towards you know the deal so what will typically happen you know say I give the guy a physical escalation stack which is something that we'll do when we teach physical game on the second on a program often what we'll see is the guy will go out and now here's another thing too because when we give the guy to stack on that Saturday night back home when I'm in the van with those men and I say to them okay here's the stack this is your mission for the night you're going to execute this on every girl that you interact with are you going to do this on 100 percent of the girls you in Iraq they're like yes absolutely 100 percent of the guys in that band say yes absolutely I'm going to do it now let me ask you a quick question here what would you guess is the percentage of guys that actually execute that when we hit the field what do you pause right now and take a guess hazard a guess you think it's 50% 30% 20% 90%  in actuality it's about 5% now again these guys when they're in the van they believe it they fucking believe that they're going to do this but what happens when they get a few well it's like it's chaotic it's like that old Mike Tyson cord everyone's got a game plan until they get hit okay and then game plan poof out the fucking window so get into get into the field you know it's chaotic and they just forget fortunately we have coaches there and the coaches are there to remind them of what to do in a very enthusiastic manner okay so but regardless go that's just like kind of the first hurdle so now a lot of times what we see is the guys will be actually executing the physical escalation sequence however the problem is this there's no dong behind it okay they're just rope going through the action there's like going through these steps in sort of a very rote mechanical manner you know Jeff you told me to do it so therefore you know this is what I'm gonna do durka durka durka so basically there's no fuel there's no movement in the dawn okay there's no concomitant movement in the dawn so again they're just going through the motions there's no actual warning let's find it now so in that the net effectiveness what we call baby tiger syndrome okay so you guys are actually they're actually fucking escalating but you know it imagine say for example you know you're standing there and all of a sudden a baby tiger comes in the room okay a baby tiger look little tiger cub don't I go cub comes in the room right so what are you gonna do if the baby tiger starts attacking you are you going to be frightened are you gonna go oh my god the baby tiger is assaulting me I am in fear for my life no you're probably gonna die oh look at the little look at the little guy look at him trying to attack oh are you a bad little tiger are you a mean little scary tiger you know and so that's like the net effect of how the girls feel when these guys are executing this stuff because they can see they're uncomfortable with it they're doing these you know these aggressive moves but there's no real threat there's no real sexual threat there now if you remember back to flawless natural one of Tim's famous quotes from that is be dangerous from the word hey and I believe as we put it you know from the moment you go up and say hey the girl should be you know aware that she is an imminent danger of getting fucked up the ass behind a trash can as I believe he put it so you know so again think about what happens now when not a baby tiger but rather a full-grown adult Bengal tiger walks into the same room as you are you going to be like oh how cute know you're like petrified you know you're fucking petrified and hoping it does not eat you okay but here's the thing so there's real threat there it's like when we go up there's no ambiguity from the get-go and this is in our tonality the way we escalate has real teeth bite behind it ie dong movement we're actually feeling aroused for the girl as opposed to going through rote motions now when a guy starts out you know it's difficult because he's so focused on these steps and the in these things he can't reach that level of unconscious competence where he can focus on his actual actually for the girl he knows he's supposed to be attracted to go he knows under regular circumstances when he was doing a cold approach no see he met her social circle or if he was introduced or he knew her for a while he would probably able to feel you know traction for her but right now he's so wrapped up in the mechanics of the game that he doesn't have that so again she can see that it's there but it's not much sure so now with the adult Tiger of course it's it's frightening you know the sexual threat is there however it's also quite majestic right it's something to be respected it's something to be it's a beautiful thing okay and that's where you know the charisma comes in the ease with yourself the not trying to impress rather expressing yourself so again you're bringing both as we say it's party dawn okay you need party and do need dawn so and again for guys we're just getting into this the baby tigers to be expected I mean everything must start somewhere so you know if you're in baby tiger right now baby tiger syndrome right now if you're you know afflicted with this syndrome don't fret you keep at it the tiger rose up you know and you can see it there you can see the seeds there right so eventually it'll grow up so again you're not familiar with acting of masculine domino polarity that's something that you need to familiarize yourself with and how do you do that by going out pushing your boundaries day by day increment by increment and trusting in the process okay and so one day you shall be a glorious creature of the jungle  Jeffie,QAeoUItnQpE
yoyoyo prefer to avoid Jeffy here and today I want to talk to you about the vaunted phrase get more girls you heard me say it time and time again on here on the forums on the Facebook groups but what does it actually mean it's just some sort of like flip into non-answer that I like to give or could there be just maybe just maybe the kernel of a deeper meaning that will actually change the entire way you approach the game and get you actual results well surprise surprise motherfucker it's the latter because remember at rst were on to some random dudes that decided to make a youtube channel and capitalize on the pickup craze okay we're people who actually live this lifestyle who've been you know going out in my case for fucking 16 years eating breathing and sleeping this up and analyzing our experiences and then distilling everything down into actual real-world actionable advice so if you like that kind of stuff subscribe to the channel and give this video a nice like so you can get that real talk brought to you every single Tuesday I see this all the time I go on these Facebook groups - inner circle groups and like a guy will get flaked on several times and then he's like well what do i do Jeffy what do I do this girl flaked on me three times how do I respond to get her to not flake on then at me anymore and I'm like get more girls get more girls that's all I'll say this pithy one you know three word answer now let me break this down for you so there's no confusion as to what this means okay here's the deal girls have endless options being thrown at them 24/7 it's this deluge it's a hurricane of male attention coming at them from all sides at all times like the old comedian Chris Rock said it's basically like they're just walking down the street from all angles it's just guys like hey want some dick want some dick want some dick this is happening at all times then you got guys on the forums and stuff getting all worked up when you know a woman doesn't respond in the act way that he'd like and he's actually seeing this is some sort of like personal attack or even worse using it as like a justification for a broad spectrum dismissal of women overall you know as bitches they're just a bunch of bitches that thrive on validation so here's here's the thing here's a perspective shift that might help you okay this would be like me complaining that you aren't clicking the open button on the latest RSD newsletter okay yeah look you've got the newsletters of every damn pickup company in the book that wants your money sitting in your inbox and I'm mad that you're not clicking on mine it's like yeah maybe you like honesty maybe you like the newsletters but at the end of the day you know I'm sending them because essentially I want something from you just like every other fucking marketer at the end of the day I'm trying to get at you for your money and look you do like spending money and you do spend money but you're gonna do it on your time without the slightest concern for the marketer trying to get it from you on their schedule like Oh Jeff he's gonna be mad if I don't click on the link zero fucks are given right so this is bringing the analogy back home girls are the same in order to get with a girl the stars essentially kind of have to a line it's got to be the right place right time in your schedule what are you doing are you traveling do you have like a family event same thing with her maybe she gets sick etc etc so you you and then combine that with this deluge of male attention you really can't get butthurt about it so how do you get around it well the only way to beat the system so to speak is how we do it at our SD basically we get so many subscribers on your email list that you have zero emotional attachment or investment to any of them like look do you think that I give two fucks if you come to the free tour if you come to the hotseat program yeah do you think that no actually I feel sorry for you if you don't because I know that these events that we put on are going to be the absolute shit and guess what it's happening with or without you in fact you and hearing me say that doesn't it kind of make you want to go and if you have like a normal emotional response the answer is probably yes so the same goes with the girls have so many numbers have so many leads so to speak that you don't care about anyone in particular and you make it obvious in your demeanor okay everything from your initial interaction to the how you text like the the amount of time you're taking a set of text back right you're all this is conveying that your party is awesome and guess what it's continuing with or without them now mind you this is not something that you're gonna verbalize it just will become sort of obvious by your demeanor right similar to how our videos kind of make it obvious without us saying it now here's the other big key though right and this is very important you've got to make it actually true that your life is awesome with or without her and look this is truly the only solution that I found after all these years of gaming okay you know all this like Walt Disney shit about like finding the super special girl that shit can kick in after you've fucked a bunch of times not before but until then you know until that point you really gotta treat them as just like zero emotional significance and again this is the only way to congruently convey that hot guy blase so to speak that non-needy attitude that is just so damn attractive for some you know undetermined 'it reason okay and here's the thing look yeah it could be faked technically for some time like you could you know micromanage your behaviors to appear as though you don't care but the thing is inevitably the neediness that comes from only focusing on like one or two prospects is gonna seep into the fabric of the interaction at every level from both again but like the time it takes you to text your back the tone etc etc and it's funny because like I said a lot of guys might hear this and then actually try to micromanage that stuff in order to give the appearance of not caring but like I said that shit never works and and there really is again only one way to go about it get more girls now whether that means you actually have more women that you're actually hooking up with or more numbers that you're actually you know having in your little sales funnel that you're trying to work or even if you're not that level yet and it just means you're going out and talking to more women you got to do it alright get more girls and when you do you're gonna notice an internal shift that happens slowly but surely until you finally arrive at the point where you are no longer that needy marketer getting butthurt about perceived slights that by the way the girl doesn't even realize or fucking think about but you've actually become the guy that has so many options you barely even notice or think about this bullshit at all anymore and that's where it all starts to click ok and all of a sudden you're getting more dates that you can even handle ok no shit and by the way one thing that I found can actually help to build this sense of abundance if you're not super good at cold approach yet is to hit up online game you know tinder Bumble etc etc and this can be a great way to sort of get the ball rolling and just set up a ton of fuckin dates ok now but of course you need to know the right way to go about it how to actually run online game and by the way I'm actually a bona fide expert at that area of game to the degree that I actually codified my knowledge and my technique into a system called execute the program which pretty much outlines anything that you need to know how to just get dates left right and center off the tender how to set up your online profile how to you know and by the way most guys feel absolutely miserably at that so that's very very important to get that dialed first how to send the right messages okay how to get her on the text to meet up in you ASAP without this endless back and forth that goes nowhere where to meet her on the date how to comport yourself on the date and what to do on the date to ensure that you pull pretty much 80% of the time that she needs something you so execute the program it's 24 hours of content with eight full hours of infield footage of me actually going on these dates so you see exactly what to do okay people absolutely love this program and I honestly believe that it is my best work in pick up and you know I've got a lot of great testimonials of this Rob actually says what I actually love about execute the program and what puts a calibers above anything else that I've seen in this niche is the system it's super organized super logical super efficient and it's like a wheel that once you initially put the energy and to get it spinning it begins to spin faster and faster and you can check that out along with a bunch of other preview videos that I've got up and execute the program comm anyway this has been your boy Jeffy saying get more girls and I'll see you next time [Music]  [Music],QaCUoCGVVp4
[Music] hey what's up this is Jeff e coming at you today from Atlanta Georgia and today I'd like to explore why a guy who can easily talk to average or cute girls will sometimes freeze up and choke when interacting with a woman of exceptional beauty okay we're going to really talk about the psychology of choking and how you can actually take steps to prevent it so when you're a newbie and you're just starting out in pick up you know failure is typically going to be the name of the game you go up to the girl you spout some half-ass bullshit and if you're lucky she actually indulges you for a minute or two and tell you quote-unquote run out of things to say and walk off with a vacant look on your face suggesting you were just sexually molested by a morbidly obese old man in an abandoned subway terminal or maybe you're a little bit more advanced than that and you can you can open you can hold extended conversations with women and hell maybe you can even escalate things to a romantic level but when it comes time to close you don't know what to do it so you fumble the pole or perhaps properly you know you fail to properly deal with the LMR back home and these are all typical experiences along the learning curve in cold approach pickup but eventually however if you pay your fucking dues and you're also intelligent about your growth well you kind of get to a point where this all becomes old hat you know you've had successes you've integrated these experiences into your firmware so to speak so when you encounter a similar situation in the future you know exactly what to do and you execute it flawlessly for the most part in most cases right you know you respond to things in real times they come up with little or no thought and it gets the point where you seriously cannot even relate to two people who have problems in this area as you're now completely in that realm of unconscious competence okay you know you see the girl roll up you open you hook you start dropping statements of intent you escalate physically you shift into rapport building you determine the logistical obstacles and deftly circumnavigates them you know you swash or fears back at the pad and you get it on easy peasy but then it happens you see your own perfect ten at the club and you approach her and suddenly it's like you're a newbie all over again you can't think of things to say you miss read the play you fail to go through windows of opportunity and you generally just kind of heard derp it up until the chick leaves confused and perhaps slightly disappointed and discuss it at your shameful performance so what what happened well you chose okay and it's happened to the best of us now choking isn't just poor performance it is worse performance than you are capable of precisely because there's a lot on the line and so this is a very very common question that I get on bootcamp and it free tours you know a guy will be like look hey Jeff you know I can pull cute average girls no problem but when it comes to those dime pieces when I step to them I just freeze up and I choke so how can I stop this well the answer lies and how our brains are structured when you practice something so much that you no longer need to actively monitor yourself in order to be good at it unconscious processing systems are at work when we then stop to focus on these automated actions well we can actually interfere with those processes and end up stripping ourselves up so fortunately however choking isn't something unique to pick up it's plagued professional athletes since the beginning of sport and as such it's something that's been studied extensively and scientists are finally beginning to understand not only the mechanisms of play but how to actively prevent it in 2008 psychologist Sean Baylock of the University of Chicago conducted a study involving two groups consisting of both novice and skilled golfers both of these groups performed a series of putts the first group was instructed to take their time while the second was told to just speed through the putts as quickly as possible all right now the novice car fleurs performed more poorly when speeding through however with the skilled group they showed the opposite pattern they actually did better when executing quickly and they suffered when they took their time and concentrated now the the researcher speculates that taking your time when you've already trained something into the ground can actually cause you to start worrying and in turn to start monitoring your performance now from a neurological perspective the part of your brain that's most involved in learning new skills is actually the cerebral cortex which controls conscious thought and it is actually adaptable to novel situations but as we practice a skill over and over we gradually shift control of that activity to the cerebellum okay which is responsible for orchestrating the fast motor activation needed to perform complex actions now the problem here is that the cerebellum unlike the cerebral cortex is not consciously accessible and as a result when we try to check our progress while we're performing you know something that's already transferred to the cerebellum that's when it that's when we tend to screw things up now the thing is you need to strike a happy medium between too much monitoring and too little no matter how advanced you are you still need to pay some attention to what's happening in front of you okay if you just kind of stand there in front of the girl derping you might not have sufficient focus to actually follow through and get the girl at all so what is the best course of action here well in one study at the University of Western Australia 20 expert golfers were told to perform putts under a pressure situation like people watching and one group focused on three words that represented actual aspects of the physical technique for example like head weight arms etc the second group focused on words that had nothing to do with golfing at all like red blue and green and the third group focused on a single word that simply encapsulated the pudding motion for example smooth now the group that focused on the physical technique actually saw a performance drop and a similar study was conducted in 1999 at the university of wales found that thinking about a concrete set of rules for example you know say you're a ski jumper and you think he'd keep the skis high and my body streamlined well that thinking about those rules they were more likely to choke than those who did not okay for those who do not have a specific set of rules in mind now conversely the golfer is that focused on the single word cues in the Western Australia study actually performed the best of all now the conclusion of course was at the degree of focused involved in fixating on a one word mantra not too much not too little prevents you from regressing into conscious control but it's still enough to activate the cue to get that particular motor program running so for example let's say that you're interacting with a girl you find her exceptionally beautiful and you start to choke so rather than thinking in detail about the proper course of action like what should I do next well it might be better to simply focus on one mental cue such as lead or positive dominance now another trick that you might want to employ when you see yourself starting to overthink things might be to distract your mind with a meaningless detail like you know the color of her nails or like a sign behind the bar so in fact there was another study from the University of Munich which began with a hypothesis that activation of the brains right hemisphere could actually help quiet the overthinking that caused us to choke in these high-pressure situations now past research on the brain has shown that rumination aka you know conscious monitoring is actually associated with the brain's left hemisphere while the right brain is associated with superior performance in automated behaviors so the right hemisphere the right hemisphere your brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa so these researchers theorize that squeezing a ball or clenching the left hand would activate the right hemisphere of the brain and actually reduce the likelihood of the athletes choking under pressure so they tested this theory with a group of Judo like our taekwondo experts and extra soccer players as well and in the soccer the soccer group they first had them take penalty shots alone and later in front of a large crowd one group is instructed to clench their left hand into a fist before the shot and this group as you probably predict performs significantly better so this little hands squeezing technique probably wouldn't help athletes they said whose performance is based on strength or stamina like a weightlifter or like a marathon runner but these effects apply kind of they will help to with the athletes performance based on accuracy and complex sequences such as soccer players golfers etc now obviously it's not hard to see these benefits might transfer over into a cold approach pickup scenario as well so in pro sports it's not entirely uncommon for the coaching staff to feed athletes highlight reels of their best recent performances for them to watch the morning before a game and what's the idea behind this well the point would be to rewire the athletes amygdala which is the hot house in your brain where memories of extreme highs and lows are consolidated and really seared into our being okay because recollection of disasters can often trigger self-consciousness well what the coaches are doing here is force-feeding them an antidote which is memories of success now look well it's not every day that I pick up some smoking super-hottie well I've certainly had my share throughout my 10 year pick up career and so in these heated moments I find it's beneficial to actually recall those successes and say to myself oh yeah you know you've hooked up with girls this caliber before you're definitely capable of this so further kind of on the flip side it's also recommended that athletes move on as quickly as possible when they mess up to avoid and graining the memory more deeply now again like I've said many a time I remember not taking action all right but I remember not taking action but I do not remember rejections at all right it simply does not get written to the disk so whenever lesson that I can glean from it is going to be noted internalized or at this stage of my development reinforced like reach those neural pathways and then the details of it are just discarded right you want to be less likely to think when the Heat's on now well all these little tricks that I've just like listed here can be actually practically practically useful and are actually based on science well what's the ultimate way to make picking up a turbo how do you feel like you're just talking to some regular girl well that's to confront the anxiety head-on and expose yourself to it at every opportunity a 2008 study in Amsterdam took a group of cops and had half of them practice shooting at like cardboard targets and the other half trained by by firing shots directly at one another with like dummy rounds now after three of these practice sessions they were put through an actual officer on officer shootout test with the dummy cartridges big surprise the cops who practiced with the cardboard actually choked in the new pressure situation while those who had trained under the same stressful conditions actually did well so you know it's very very common for guys learning pickup to just kind of train the basic skills train those basic skills into the ground but you know they'll do it with safe average targets low-risk groups of girls and they become trained in the mechanics of game but not under the high pressure situations of the hotter girls and the tougher groups and so in those circumstances they'll often fail so forcing yourself to step to the hotter girls whenever you see them is going to minimize the possibility of freezing up for the same reason that say like letting spiders crawl all over you makes them seem less threatening or frightening because your brain gradually adapts so the circumstances that would have once made you uneasy no longer feel novel or threatening the more exposure that you get to the hotter girls and the more that you succeed with them the less likely you're going to get that whole effective experience so you need to develop a rule that says whenever I see a girl that intimidates me in the club I must immediately step to her without thought or hesitation now of course this is one of those things that's very very easy to say but very difficult to do in practice now I discussed this with Tyler length and he told me that he literally spent one whole year going out seven nights a week back in 2011 to get this particular sticking point handle and he said in retrospect is one of the most difficult things he'd ever put himself through but it was also simultaneously one of the most rewarding okay so ultimately doing this is going to imbue you with the assurance that you can deal with any eventualities in field and it'll further serve to cut off any second thoughts you might have in the moment about your likelihood of success with that hot hot girl which is standing right in front of you so this is Jeffy signing off from Atlanta and I'll see you next time

know what up it's your proverbial boy Jeffy and I'm here today in the San Francisco Bay Area and I wanted to take advantage of this beautiful day in this beautiful Vista to bring to you what I feel is an extremely fundamental yet extremely important video now you may have heard me describe the idea of game as it were as being largely two concepts there's inner game there's outer game a buddy of mine he recently used this phrase and it really stuck with me and I really enjoy this description of game everybody's bored so give him something different to talk about and then make it easy for her to go home with you and not feel guilty about it so when we're saying everyone's bored give him something different I'm talking about doing something different than what every other guy is doing like one of most guys that don't study the social interaction or even ponder this stuff do they go to the club they get SHM a murd they roll up on girls and they say you're beautiful you're hot and then they touch them on the lower back with some creepy hand right and then they proceed to ask them a bunch of interview questions right that's the norm that is the statistical roulette that most guys are playing that is gonna get 90 to 95 percent of them just dismissed without even giving them the time of day right so we want to bring something different to the table so we study how to be funny how to be charming how to be self amusing how to be not the guy that's just like pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy but the guy that's adding energy to their night as opposed to leeching energy to the night and we can go down that rabbit hole really deep but that's not the topic of this video the topic of this video today I want to get into that second part which is make it easy for her to go home with you or hook up with you without feeling guilty about it in in order to do that consistently you have to develop a working knowledge of the mechanics involved right many many guys in fact most guys for that matter when they're interacting with the girl and they even guys that study this stuff oftentimes they're just kind of derping along and they have little or no idea of where they are in the interaction and where they need to take it like what's the next step they don't know what the steps of a pickup of a cold approach walk-up are they don't they have no idea so today I want to break it down and I'm not gonna go like super deep down the rabbit hole I just want to give you an overview of what the steps are so you can begin to think the next time that you're out in public you're next time you're interacting with a girl you can have this awareness and you're not just derping along hoping it goes somewhere right you can begin to start actively moving it in a more kind of systematic methodical way to the result or the outcome you want okay so without further ado let me start breaking it down right now okay step one and this is before you even approach is you want to put yourself in the state that you want the girl to be in or you want to put yourself in the state that the girl wants to be in I've said this time and time again most people at the club what are they there for they're not there to you know stress and trip they're there to unwind from their stressful workweek so if you go up anxious with trepidation hoping it works trying to impress them like trying to get something out of them trying to infiltrate their party as opposed to already enjoying yourself and adding something to their night you're gonna get blown out almost every single time you're gonna get a poor reaction nearly every single time so for me if you see me out in the club very rarely will you see me like standing there you know arms crossed I was at boot camp recently and at the end of the night we ended up at the karaoke bar it's like 1:15 in the morning and everyone in this bar is fucking hammered they're fucking wasted I'm swerve like turnt up there I see a cab right and literally everyone in the in this karaoke bar is like having a great time except for two people the students who are sticking out like sore thumbs like blender grabs the girls like hello there's a high and they're like how were you and there's weird and just like blows them the fuck out it's like and to the up to the outside observer it's obvious that these guys are weird people doing some weird shit right they're not actually enjoying themselves so it's very important regardless of the environment you start to pump yourself up now how do you do that well motion creates emotion that's a huge fundamental principle that I've been espousing since nearly the beginning it's an old Tony Robbins thing in fact so bare minimum I'm gonna start popping my feet to the music right I'm gonna start popping my head a little to music if I'm in a country music club I don't know I don't like that shit but if I'm there I'm gonna be the biggest fucking cowboy there right I'm gonna be ox a horse ride a cowboy so and I'm gonna get into that groove right again bare-minimum it's gonna be popping my head around more likely I'm gonna be screaming some gibberish throwing some shit around wearing some weird headdress like weaving a penis straw in the air like I'm Michael Tilson Thomas the famous conductor from the San Francisco Symphony etcetera etcetera in order to prime my physiology for the approach so when I go up I'm not some weirdo like leaching energy I'm adding energy okay so that's number one put yourself in the state that you want there to be in before you go up number two or step number two rather is you want to go up with a self-amusing opener now look 95 percent of the time when I'm at boot camp and I I asked the students before we go in on the first night I say so what are you typically open they'll say something like hey what's up or hi I'm bill and then they just stand there and like stare expecting the girl back oh hello bill how are you allow me to suck your dick like it realistically that's not gonna happen is that that opener of hey what's up is that bad in and of itself not necessarily but again it's what every other guy is doing and it's not really adding anything she's like okay you're bill so what you know what I mean maybe if the guys like some kind of like six foot five male model or something like that or a celebrity that might work but again if it's just like Rando commando bill you know it's likely he's going to get a brush-off so when I go up I want to continue that state that I put myself in by saying something that's gonna amuse myself right you know something bizarre something random perhaps like my name is Satan I'm a professional mermaid or you know what's uh what's something I've been saying a lot lately good evening I'm Chinese and I love balls like what I'm Chinese and a level of it makes no sense whatsoever but it's it's different now here's the other thing you want to swing through the open okay so step one put yourself in the state you want the girls to be in step two go up with a self-amusing opener so you're adding energy not leeching energy number three swing through the open until you get to what's called the social social hook points where they go from saying who the fuck is this person why is he speaking to me to okay this guy's cool let's continue speaking to them that can happen instantaneously they can take up to a couple of minutes but until you reach that point it is your responsibility to uphold 90% of the conversation and this is what used to be called the 90/10 rule right you cannot expect to go up to someone and just have that like say some like one-liner and expect them to be like oh hey let me a now engage you in conversation strange person I don't even know right and this is one of the biggest issues I see with with newer guys they'll just go up and they just expect it to crack crack wide open I had a client in San Diego a while ago who he was very butthurt about this he when he would go up and they wouldn't just crack open immediately be like oh my god you're amazing I love you he took it like ultra personally you know and he took the fact that they would give him the skeptical look he took that extremely personally as well and you know the skeptical look that I'm talking about is like when you first go up and they're just kind of like like oh what like what and he would get that he would get that reaction he'd be like they're bitches they're fucking mean people like no dude they're just skeptical what do you think that skepticism is a result of it's a result of being approached a billion times a fucking night by weirdos and losers who are just like touching them on the back and saying you're beautiful right so it's an autopilot response that has been generated over years and years of creepers coming up they don't know that you're cool yet and you can't hold it against them that they don't know that one of the great joys of gaming for me is getting that initial skepticism and watching it turn around as I prove myself as I showed that my state doesn't fluctuate and I'm not so easily swayed by the vicissitudes of the environment again I don't hold it against her that she doesn't realize I'm cool yet and I continue to put my personality out there and put out that good emotion out there until she gets drawn into that emotion by the law of state transfer and I crossed the social hook point or I get blown the fuck out hearted like two minutes go by and they look at me like I'm an alien cuz I know Jeff's for some not for others and I'm like well I guess they're idiots I guess they have poor taste right that's the that's the conclusion that I arrive at but I'm for some not for others that's how this game is played you can go up and talk to anyone and they can tell you to fuck off right that's the game that's the name of the game so again number one put yourself in the safe you want them to be in step two self-amusing opener step three swing through until you get to the social hook point step four now that you're you know she's accepted you and she started speaking with you now you want to start leaning into the romantic angle as opposed to this platonic angle because a lot of times when guys can get in they can start talking to the girl it just can it stays platonic right and this is a huge thing and you've if you're a new guy or you know if you've been again for any length of time you've probably had this happen where you know I go up and I can open but then it just fizzles out right interest is allowed because they never take it to the romantic level either out of fear that they're going to blow it right that they're gonna ruin it if they try to push it further or that simply they just don't know what the what the fuck to do so you have to start introducing the romantic angle as opposed to platonic angle because if you don't you'll see what happens you'll get about five minutes of polite conversation and then you'll see them go like like initially that when you roll up they're like excited they're like oh cool Wow a guy's competently approaching and and bringing a fun vibe I like this and they're like oh cool all right he did this this could be good and then you'd never take anywhere then there's kind of like oh okay a waste of my time okay I got to go to the bathroom by you know or whatever and then they leave so how do you start introducing that well personally I'll first start off by introducing statements of intent verbal statements of intent I'll start off pretty innocuous I might say something like are you involved in the fashion industry wow I love your look it's hot so anyway blah blah blah blah blah like very casually not like I'm putting some spotlight on it and looking for her reaction because that puts puts pressure on her and like again like it's essentially saying like oh you're you're hot what do you think about that and saying here I'm like you know laughs laughing and giving a sinister that hath unlikely ring and drooling at her until like she either accepts it or leaves right no again it's almost an afterthought I'm like yeah blah blah blah blah vibe I vibe and in case you don't know vibing is it's just shooting the shit essentially and free associating what if she says and that'll start to drop these in and then it starts I like ramp them up a little bit more right I might be like damn girl you don't even want to know what I'm thinking about doing you right now she like what like it's nasty she's like what like girl I just want to get to know you over period of several months and meet your peer group and see if I have any commonalities with them and maybe engage in those activities with them maybe some Ultimate Frisbee maybe get into a relationship and go see your family for Christmas make a fucking trip a bit maybe have children together watch them grow up move out of the house achieve their hopes dreams and aspirations and then hold hands and our golden years and die in love that's what want to fucking do to you right now girl I'm nasty motherfucker you better ask somebody right and so it's it's kind of these humorous things that are putting us into a romantic context and then from there I might you know ramp it up even further or like you know dam crawl when I Eskimo kiss your pussy you know but again we're like sprinkling these in again the vibing that you're doing is like a river and you start to sprinkle in these statements of intent they go blink like little pebbles and get carried away okay so again number one put yourself in the state you want him to be in number two self-amusing opener number three swings through the opener and continue speaking just keep fucking talking until you either get to the hook or you're blown out right make again make a commitment to engage in until she either leaves or accepts it or clearly want you know clearly indicates that she wants you to get the fuck away from her number four begins to be in statements of intent number five begin escalating the physicality right and the basic steps that you want to think of our first I will first I'll touch your hands all the other shake our hands or I'll interlace my fingers with hers it's pretty innocent but it's also pretty intimate right so if she accepts that that's like going from zero to ten she's like okay now again if the girl has no one - if the girl won't even interlace hands with you after you know you're hooked and after you've dropped a couple of statements with Ted it's not like you ruined it it's like that girl never had any intention of letting your penis get anywhere near her okay anyway like outside of its closed outside of its clothing garments so so that's step one step two I'll breach what's known as the personal space barrier you know I'll get closer to her but closer than eighteen inches and I might like do a slow dance with her next all again and spacing these out over like several minutes each time then I might like hiss or on the neck that I might kiss her on the mouth etc so I'm slowly incrementally introducing the both the verbal flirtation I'm also incrementally introducing the physicality okay so if I get to it so again reiterate again number one put yourself in the state you wanted to be in before you approach number two self-amusing opener number three swing through the open till you get to the hook number four statements of intent number five layer in the physicality until you get to the kiss or somehow otherwise are able to determine that she is now potentially thinking about hooking up with you and this is what we call the sexual hook point again it doesn't mean she wants to necessarily means now she's open to the idea if you play your cards right right again she's like okay this guy he's you're interested in me in a romantic way I'm open to that if he if he can play it out smooth if he doesn't do anything weird and if you can handle what comes next so what comes next now well now you need to start to figure out what are the logistical obstacles that might come into play and are you going to be able to circumnavigate them now this is worthy of its own video and I'll do that another time but again ask her things like who are you here with ask her things like where do you live ask her things like what's going on after this what do you have to do in the morning and all the answers these questions are going to determine whether this is going to be a good candidate for you to possibly hook up with that very night or if you might want to get her phone number her Instagram and an angle to hook up with her and go out on a romantic date with her after the fact or if she's gonna be like moving to Bangkok tomorrow or something like that and she had her flights in an hour and she has to drive her friend home for like maybe move on to greener pastures so you don't waste your time because that is in fact the only commodity we have in this game is time number seven spend the requisite time with her so that she feels comfortable and okay with about leaving with you because the thing is look most guys do what they go for comfort they go for the comfort first right so they think that if they just go up and they say hey what's your name here what do you do they ask all these interview style questions then the girl be like oh I'm comfortable with this guy and then they can but then they can go for attraction what they don't understand is like they don't know who the fuck you are like if there's no attraction why would they have reason to even tell you the answer since fucking questions right just like why are you it'd be like if some homeless person came up to you on the street it was like hey man what's your name where do you live you'd be like who the fuck are you why your why are you asking me all these weird questions I have no reason to watch you to even know this right so again guys go for the Comfort first and then it seemed to get attraction later we do this backwards we flip it so we go to traction first so then she's like okay I like this guy I'm interested in him in that way and now once that's established now you can begin to ask these comfort questions and part of that is asking the logistical questions and fractionating back and occasionally keeping that romance so it doesn't again fizzle out over the longer term so what I found is generally it's gonna take about 10 to 20 minutes to get to the sexual hook point where she's now attracted to you and then you probably need to spend an additional 30 minutes to an additional hour actually building that comfort and why do they make you spend that time well I'll tell you why because 90% of the guys they will not be able to actually spend that time without doing some weird shit like the creep is not gonna be able to spend an hour without say he's gonna say something weird he's gonna do something weird and she's gonna be like Jesus thank God I fucking didn't leave with this guy the mask will slip and she'll be like oh thank goodness I didn't go he's trying to be a fucking creeper so all you got to do really is just stick in there act fuckin normal established like that you're a normal person that's like safe to be around and then from there circumnavigate the logistical obstacles if there are any again deal with the peer group befriend the peer group make sure that are on your side etc and then leave together pull and then from there it's just PMD right and of course there could be a whole other video about that but again that's beyond the scope of this so again to reiterate in all their glory number one put yourself in the state you want the girls to be in number two self-amusing opener number three swinging through the opener nine 90/10 rule until you get to the social hook point number four start layering in statements of intent number five start layering in physicality until you establish that this is a romantic encounter and she's attracted to you number six figure out the logistical obstacles that might be there and determine if you are going to be able to in fact circumnavigate them number seven spend the records of time so she feels comfortable going home with you number eight paul number nine right so that's it in a nutshell again I wanted this to be a pretty quick video because I think it's a fundamental thing that a lot of guys need to understand and once you understand all these steps you should start to not just derp around while you're in an interaction but always be thinking where am I in this interaction what is the next step and what are the choices that I should be making that in the behaviors I should be exhibiting right now that are going to get me to that next step right so you're focused you're clear and what your outcome is and you're and you're actually moving towards it in a more methodical way as opposed to just randomly going out there and hoping for some statistical roulette you know that the gods will smile on you and dump something in your lap the perfect scenario which does happen from time to time but it's certainly nothing that you'd want to build a strategy around this has been Jeffy from again the wonderful San Francisco Bay let me catch you next time I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that completely automates the process to get any dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do this is execute the program version 2.0 the ruthlessly efficient highly repeatable system for the modern day online gangster it's over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of a filled footage welcome down case network and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you polar that night I covered the exact repeatable pattern takes to take a girl home nearly 85 percent of the time she agrees to meet up with me this is my online masterpiece at bottom line - just plain works now you have a choice to make keep using the Internet to beat off or use it to have someone else meet it off for you so decide I'll fasten wanna start getting laid and execute the program [Music],R2uvc6AwjRY
fuck Oh  we sure like that it's essentially what it's a day game situation okay so whether it's day or night typically right because this is a bus it's pretty much do a game is anywhere where they're not expected to be open so you go to a club it's kind of expected that they're going to get open by someone right the bus maybe not so much so the bottom line is the fundamental rule is pickup is what put yourself in the state you want the girls to be in because whatever you feel they're going to feel so if you go up to say a person on the bus or a crowded Starbucks for that matter and you open what's everyone in that fucking bus going to do what's this what's he doing this is a fucking fucking pickup huh oh I oh I heard about oh I heard about this shit I read about this I read about this and they said Pokemon they choked her oh this is this is that shit okay let's let's see right so what's going to happen is the girl is going to look to you to see how to respond to that social pressure so again if you're in there and you're like hey like so right nervous and awkward about it she's generally going to take that cue and feel it's weird so the the bottom line with that is again like I said you do it the first couple times it's going to feel weird but you have to familiarize yourself with it today to the extent where it just seems like you're just you're just like that an outgoing friendly guy right in daytime I'm like just be super cool super friendly and again - if they're basically like fuck off I'm trying to read or something then then fuck off nicely you know because you don't want like fucking white knight or re happening things of that nature like in it they take the fucking fuck off you have the right to approach anyone and anyone has the right to tell you to fuck off that's the games played so you got to be able to read social cues but the most that again the bottom line is if you want to maximize your chances of not getting told to fuck off then you really got to internalize believe that's completely normal and I'd say the biggest you know I opener for me was going out with my buddy evil Stifler who's a natural quote unquote and when this key can go anywhere dude he'll be on my airplane he'll be on the fucking bus he'll be at the bus stop you know what I mean is I got wake up in the morning I put on my finest shit I go down to the fucking coffee shops that's how I start my date like that's how he starts his day he'll he'll literally by the way that's all this guy does his game right it's literally all he does so again he's acclimating himself to it where it's completely normal so when he sits down it doesn't seem weird so again that's the thing you want to go up super cool super friendly and like act like it's normal right and then be it and then and then work on again this a big thing with game to day game that game whatever work on cultivating emotional acuity so you're able to see signs of like when you should back off we should chill etc when you should when you should put your put the pedal to the floor yeah just dude here you had a hand up didn't you know okay this guy Charlie day I get that shit - people call me Charlie day all the time - so my question is up so I really appreciate your online programs Oh for me one thing I've noticed is I'll get the numbers now sometimes I'll get like maybe too many numbers and I'll try to set up a date with a girl and like the scheduling doesn't work it eventually just fizzles out a lot of leads because it's just yeah it's a big thing that's a big thing okay and I discussed in the program but to reiterate basically like all this eyes too big for the stomach syndrome so we're going out in real life whether you're going out with your collecting leads I guess you call it from the internet tinder or what have you bumble hinge whatever OkCupid it's very easy to accrue massive amounts of phone numbers now the problem with this I mean it's fine it's great you're taking action but I never want to have more than say 10 numbers I'm working at any given time because otherwise what happens you lose bad with and you do not have the ability to adequately focus on any given one and you're kind of like running yourself ragged across like you don't you can you lose track of who you said what - dah dah dah dah so basically all like about like a like a reserve I'll put like ten numbers up on the board and then I'll start working them down like I'll get ten numbers and I'll plan my week cuz I go out three nights a week guaranteed you know whether it's bootcamp or whether I'm up on myself I'm going out typically Friday night Saturday night and Sunday or Thursday night one of you know three nights a week Wednesday is date night that's when I go I'm a fucking girlfriend and then that leaves me you know what was that three days to either like stay at home and watch TV I call that a good night's sleep or go out on fucking dates follow up on numbers right nowadays I really wanted to do that now my girl will just go out and Beach and pull ass but um she's she's very good at it now she got very good at it up yeah go ahead it's not so much that it's that I'll have maybe ten women in my final set of dating one girl for instance it'll mess up because you know I tried one day that she thought this she's busy that day I'll try it you know actually because she's busy minutes we don't interestingly enough I'd say like on average you've got about two weeks for a number the average number before it for go stale however I there are outliers I've had times where I thought the world two years later I had times where I got the number and I fucked about eight years later was my longest yeah I had one where I was like eight yeah eight or nine years what happened was I actually got it's kind of funny I actually got the girl's number I made out with her in the club and me and my girl at the time was the Chess Club where we pulled her home but she brought her friend along a friend fucked it up and they ran out of the house and terror and then eight years later I seen her on tinder and I went out with her and I recognized her but I didn't say anything and then after we fucked I sent her thing a picture of her and I together eight years previous and I was like I died like dude I had to go in the garage and pull out an old computer and pull out the hard drive and fuck okay dig through it find find the fucking picture and I said it through my Kansas you so I go that's crazy it's like I think we met I'm like I think we met back in like 2004 she's like yeah I think we kissed or something but yeah this would happened anyway yeah but but again there are those outliers but but generally um you know scheduling I find especially with again when you're deal with numbers whether it's the internet whether it's the fucking thing numbers are always going to have an element of flakiness to it and an inability cuz now you're competing with their life when you're there in the club York it's it's the bubble of the dreamlike bubble of you and her in there when you get the fucking phone number now there's other things that are taken into consideration she's got the TPS reports to fucking file she's got her fucking sister coming in from Topeka that she's got to deal with she's gotta felt like move she's moving the cat gets sick this and that right so so again now you're compete with people's life generally though again I would be curious to see how you're trying to set these dates up because I set that shit up fucking hard you know I don't fuck around dude it ain't no texture will ask robbery back and forth and all this shit it's like yo what's up meat tonight like I'll be like I'll send a value giving text in the morning typically something along the lines of hey I'm at the gym I want to be totally fucking jacked for our romantic date it was a lot of work but I finally think I look good enough for you nervously twiddles thumbs and if she responds anything to this what does that tell me no not interest it means the phones in her fucking hand and she's looking at it that's all I would care about is the phone in her hand and is she currently looking at it she responded something so that means it is so now I'm gonna be like let's meet up later boom let's meet later for drink and chicken chickens right so and then it she's like oh I'm busy tonight I'll be like oh cool a suite whatever I'll say cancel and she doesn't cancel a bit cool ok then I might say when are you free this week so like Thursday I'll be like ok 10 to tip Thursday I'll have Siri pencil you in come Thursday I treat it as though it's just a fucking fresh one because again you set this shit up for the future you're going to get flakes why shit happens right all the thing at work came up all my fucking friends in town whatever so again I always try to set up for same night now the thing is I'll try it like three times and then general can sign it to the dustbin I never delete numbers but I'll take her off the fucking board and sometimes they'll resurrect but generally not but the thing is I'm constantly it's like a constant the thing is it's a constant influx of leads it's like a shark you got to keep fucking moving you can't just say oh have this work them through it as you were working them down you're adding new ones in so it's still like a buffer you have like a buffer of ten and you're working them through this buffer and then put them into the hopper and they go through the funnel right so they're here then they get to the number right here they get to the number they get to the date they get possibly to the day three again I don't go on day 3 s though if they don't fuck in the first date I generally won't see him again and that's not because I'm like a dick it's just because a I don't have time and and be the kind of girl that look what he's going to happen after she comes to my house and I take my dick out and all that and then then she goes home probably the first thing she's going to do she's going to make a trip to uh you know google.com and she's going to google my name and you know it's going to come up the rape band pick up motherfucker or whatever and the kind of Olivia for this way the kind of girl that doesn't sleep on the first date is probably not going to like the rape van pick up motherfucker you know what I'm saying stranger things have happened actually sometimes I had to find out like this is fucking crazy I'm coming over to do it right but I say yeah for you guys don't feel like oh I can't do day two you know day three or whatever you know some girls just say that I'm just don't fuck in the first date I've had it where the girl like I didn't bang her on the first date and then she's like oh right yeah it's no first day no first date and then she leaves and like literally the next day she's like what's up I'm coming over and she just comes over so like right let's go it's like the next day it's like the next fucking day it's just I got a hard rule I've also had where the girls like I don't fucking the first day I meet someone and then literally it's like 11:59 midnight I'm like it's the next day she's like okay boom like what I've literally had that shit happened to but but yeah you know I would say there is a there is a healthy amount of luck involved too in like the stars aligning schedule versus schedule especially if you're a busy person people are busy so again a lot of it meeting up with it's just like there's luck but what do you do how do I compensate for that volume I just work fucking volume and I make it a system that's why people laugh they say oh the funnel hole the funnel yeah oh yeah funnel motherfucker it ain't no joke okay how am I supposed to keep this shit fucking straight you have any idea the fucking volume I work the thing is volume compensates for for the flaker II use volume to compensate for the flaker II and you'll get more than you ever need more these new ever fucking could could even handle okay like look at this guys doing like a Hitler salute I was like Hitler yes Hitler  yes leprechaun Hitler we'll get a shot of leprechaun you will blow your face well we'll see gif fucking mustache on your ass too I'm like an armband and shit oh yes please raise your voice a touch my next question I think is some something if everybody was going to be in Game four was gonna have to face the Vidhan game didn't really have it wasn't a hard case when I started but didn't have a lot of game just like party lays whatever okay we don't even hear the whole life story can we stick to the fuckin question I have a girlfriend and she's really cool I like her personality like grounded in a purpose a little bit I feel like there's an authentic connection and she's function pretty fuckin hot and the thing is I feel like I'm not done growing and like part of me like for example what I'm planning to do is like save 10 grand go do immersion for like three months ago so there's there two different paths so you got the girlfriend okay so obviously this is like the main paradox in game okay this is the major paradox in game you want to get better at the shit but then as you're going out you're doing it you're gonna sleep with girls and if you like them enough to sleep with them you're obviously gonna probably there's a pretty good chance you're like them enough to want to see them again and then feelings you know grow and so forth and you're like I really like this person I respect them as a friend I don't want to fucking hurt them but at the same time I want to go out and fucking beast mode so look  I mean yeah you want you want you want to go fuck you want to fuck much girls and as you accrue this ability to do so it makes it easy feasible to do so you know how old are you by the way okay so you're just starting to you know in a way so so on the other hand you want like the you know the emotional benefits that come from having something can share your life with and talked about work and on the shit you know everything comes in having the relationship so I struggled this for many years now I X aloud every different route I tried full cheating okay for the pull the full fucking cheating route you know I had a girlfriend for three years you know back from like oh seven to 2010 and I was pretty good with that one I only cheated on her 13 times and the first year not at all the second year it started to creep in like boot camp different city stewardess shit like that and then we got the van and huh and then that was that plus we got the fucking van I was like I thought I was like Dexter I'd have like a do a double life you know like I'm the family guy here and then at night in the van I had a change of clothes in the van and she had like the whole I thought I was so fucking cool so smart like - she's not done she knows what the fucking van is for okay so then I got busted really hard like caught red-handed basically and and I you know it destroyed her and I I said I'm you know I'm here I'm supposed to be like this integrity guy at least on some level there I'm out here talking to you a lot of people like to look up to me like it's a how I should do this you know I should behave in this these instances so I'm like dude I don't want to be responsible for that ever again you know so I don't give a fuck so neck going forward I'm going to tell the fucking truth going forward always regardless of the fucking consequences and I'm not going to get in a relationship with someone unless they understand god damn well that it ain't no monogamy bullshit cuz I'm terrible at it okay I'm not good at it I don't like it I think it's unnatural I think it's creepy okay I mean don't get don't get me wrong some of my best friends are monogamous it's like what a racist would say like go can you rock some of my best friends by the way I tell us something like like like I have black friends and like oh yeah let's see a picture of you with them so I'm like a so I've been on collect I have a folder on my phone a pictures of me with my black friends like specifically it's like here look here's Madison here's dude he's Trey's like like they're all there they're all there so by the way I want it knowing that I am responsible for getting the black guy hired I push for that I brought him to I brought him to the attention okay all right I I did not get the the fat guy hired but we have we got a black eye we got a fat guy now all we need is like a fucking Indian in a wheelchair and and then then the crybabies can shut up about the fucking you know advantages man so yeah we're going to get our SD wheelchair Mohammed yeah and then somebody's going to complain for sure though still like regardless warning the SOB they'll be like the back he has an advantage because he has a fuckin handicap parking spot it's like better logistics better pull logistics they go in the like this mini man is shit but yeah so I tried the cheating I tried the full thing and then my previous relationship I got to she was down for it like she's like okay we'll have the open relationship but then she was kind of like she was like you know Jeff the thing is they'll be okay with it until they're not right because in this cuz she was like she was open to but like she didn't even want to you know she probably had like a couple little guys in the side or ever seen and she was said to me at the break up she's like Jeff it would be cool it'd be fine if it was like two or three girls you see once in awhile on the side not like a hundred and twenty-five bro I'm like I see your point like I get it like she's I can't do it like so we broke up and I think the big reason for it for that was because you know she'd see me like I'd go out on all these adventures you know I come on these trips and I'm out like yeah these fucking clubs the best clubs in the country and then another she even sees videos of us like partying and fucking excess and like having a ball like wearing weird costumes at shit and then I come home and I'm like this game of Thrones you know I like just sit on the couch watch fucking TV so like you know these fucking adventures I can't be a part of that well because you don't fucking piece ho you know like that's it's what I told her you know and she's like she said she's like it's either me or the game I was like I'll miss ya you know and then I was like I said I'll see if I look out there it makes me makes me glad I'm not you because I know what's going to happen you go out there you're gonna you want like a nice guy who's like a calm guy and you're going to go out there it's going to be some fucking loser who fucking sucks and sure enough eight months later she's texting me every fucking other week like I'm used to you I knew you dude I was wrong I mean it's like too late I got a new girlfriend now and guess what she goes beast mode so that's two that that for me and I'm still friends with her you know we hang out and shit but we don't want to fuck and the thing is it's like I go out with my new girl it's like not only can she participate we go on the trip together and we bang hoes together then we high-five and kick them the fuck out in lol so again it supposed it's like an enhancement it's it's not it's not like extra it for us it's an enhancement our relationship and furthermore on a given night I can either like if she's like my what you want to do 9:00 honey let's go bang some sluts I'm like okay so like let's just stay and watch TV I'm like okay I really don't care you know so I we have that so for me personally that's like the third way that I found not the cheating way not like the open relationship where she's unhappy about it like literally for me at least it's like we got to go out do it together now finding one of those that's the therein lies the rub right it's like lightning strike right so yeah do you want a quick quick follow-up on that yeah it's going good I just feel like you know that concept like yeah of course yeah I mean but things are super young - so it's like fuck it you know you got to got it you got to decide what you want long what's going to be better for you long-term it's like let up love and do it yeah I mean the thing is to what do you wanna be you wanna be the fucking pickup superhero or just want to be competent right like most guys probably don't wanna be like some fucking superhero weirdo right who drives around in a fucking van okay you know I'm saying like you don't want to like take it to that extreme put on some weird headband acting a fool thinks he's Jesus like you know like but you want to just competence so again you're gonna have to find a third way and if you've already set that if you already set the relationship up a certain way changing it's going to be very hard so in the future you have your parameters set that's why I'd say you know right now you're kind of in a quandary but in the future going forward you have to set up those parameters before right very important yeah here front row yeah one problem that I've had a lot was I be myself up too much because like I'm a nubian like yeah I'm still young I'm 18 and like I expect results fast and you see all these videos and stuff and CL infield like how do you leverage how we beat yourself up like positive negative because you can't look you don't need to be a master to enjoy it to enjoy game right so you the thing is you have to find enjoyment in the process itself it's called the game it's like all the fucking work right so you really gotta you gotta get to the point where you're finding some kind of enjoyment in the process now when I go out personally now don't get me wrong when I started I fucking sucked fuck it sucked like I go out it wasn't even like I was like we were psychos me and Tyler fucking psychos like we were just going up hello ma'am like today like ignore we're going up in there like you put the book the fuck out of here here kick this guy's ass kick this guy's ass like get him out of here oh my god look it's that guy he's getting worse every week oh my god like like literally I feel like that because we're dressed all garish and fucking crazy and shit you know it was fucking rough but for me it was just like I always saw it is like lucid dreaming or something you know when you're the club you're making things change with your words you're doing shit like your behave it's like I don't know I find a lot of freedom in doing this like when I go out and I can like take a person who's again a complete stranger and when I first go up they almost always look at me the same way you know say yes that's a good skeptical look Oh the next idiot of the night you know what I mean and in fact I even leverage that that's one of my favorite openers good evening yes thank you I'm the next idiot of the night speaking with you or am I the first do I have the honor of having been the first idiot of the night to come out and speak with you like no can't win them all probably won't be the last either right hey what's up I'm Jeff right and then BOOM roll into it from there just the fact that I'm aware of what they're experiencing a nightly basis again that's a great tacit but anyway so um when I'm in there I get that look because they don't know shit they don't know who the fuck I am they're gonna find my version or if I'm fucking Jeff Allen they don't know what the fuck is going on no one knows shit about your style too you bring it to their ass right so a lot of guys I think oh I'm so experienced I should go up and they should fucking bowed out immediately they don't know shit you got to let them know so the thing is for me I find a lot of expression in it so even when I sucked though I didn't think badly of myself I didn't I thought it was really cool even back then just I wasn't getting results right so huh so that's that's an interesting thing they say um whether you're trying to like diet or whether you're trying to get fit or trying to get wealth or whatever you got to appreciate where you're at in the moment because again it's like what's that Oh cliche it's the journey it's a journey not about the destination so you got to learn to find enjoyment right now don't beat yourself up when you're going out alone like I said you one thing I do like about it is it really reinforces a certain certain lessons the most important one being the idea that you need to get on top of the club before it gets on top of you so when you first walk into the club and like say it's the early you know early stages of the night and the club's populating it's like you're sitting out there like on a wait like on the ocean on a surfboard and then like as it populates the wave begins to swell up behind you and as it swells up if you want to catch that way if you better start taking action immediately because there's an inertia to taking action and then there's an inertia to not take to inaction as well so if you just sit there the longer you sit there in that environment the more difficult is going to be the fucking motivate and actually start stepping when so when the club actually fills up so again as it's populating you need to be going going going now at this point I've been doing this a very long time as you well know and at this point I could literally just fucking sit in the club for two hours on fucking Instagram like top the door pretty dope the door to do playing or playing fucking neck o at su-mei you guys know that's a super awesome game you collect Japanese cats yeah it's the shit let me uh it's a fact you want to this is it sounds pretty cool right yeah so anyway so I just got like a super rare one but anyway I can see it up yeah I got a I got the st. / trick and then I got a Anthony / Dane so uh but anyway I can dig around in there and then like I think I could be like see a girl walk by that I like it like Oh boom and like lon I could BAM like snap it right into it and in fact a lot of the time the camera guys have difficulty catching me doing the open because I could stand there for an hour and a half they think oh I guess he's not feeling it tonight or whatever like he's being a punk or whatever why not and then I'm like a boom boom like BAM they're like oh shit you know I mean so I go from zero to 100 but initially I had to do that so the thing is yeah fine wings if you can but you know I don't think there's any harm and going out a lot I do it all I do it from time to time today but um insofar as the the follow-up shit is concerned oh man yeah that's a that one's tough basically what I found is if I want them to follow up then they won't do you know I mean why do you think that is because because it's like anytime that I sleep with a girl and I'm like damn she was fucking hot that was I haven't had one that hot a long time or she's like top five did it it's almost guaranteed to not work because I'm going to be yeah because I'm going to be internally that dynamic is going to seep into my text I'm gonna be like oh hey so what hang out what are you doing what do you do it like eat no matter how much I fucking try like little seep in and then I'll see it in retrospect okay god damn it that was bad motherfucker right so it's really about like cultivating entitlement right so like and not entitlement in the sense that I have entitlements to dance ended up I'm more like you know you you feel comfortable getting good things do you know I mean so the more basically how do you how do you build entitlement and tell them it's a continuum - by the way you know you could have fucked you know Miss America and fucking Victoria's Secret model ten years ago that was fucking ten years ago bitch that don't what do you do what have you done lately you know I'm saying you're only as good as your last game right so so entitlement can go up and down up and down now fortunately for you guys you know you live in a place where beauty is very abundant in San Francisco not so much you know it's I don't favor been there but it's you know Greenpeace and granola all the way like by wearing like a flannel shirt imagine a whole city that is Silver Lake and that's San Francisco lady of Silver Lake that's that's what it is hipsters yes so but anyway yeah just making sure you're stepping to making sure you're stepping to anyone that intimidates you out dude it's like the thing is to like when you're sending texts always ask yourself like what am I trying to convey here every time you send the text you're sending a packet or a series of texts you're sending a packet of emotional information like what am I trying to say to this person and what does this convey about me as a person I see a lot of times when I see these like text threads for the execute the program the internet shit or I see like text threads from guys and like the inner circle groups like like are you even thinking about how this is making you look to these people like what is this saying about you as a person so about sub Communications so yeah there's not an easy answer to that how do I keep them coming back I mean obviously being good at sex is a good one you know of course the more you do it the better so keep practicing that sex you know keep practically plucking at the end uh and and you know that's one obviously and then a lot of times it's completely out of your control too you know you go they go back and I mean you know they realize they love their boyfriend that they forgot to tell you about or failed to mention conveniently or maybe they moved maybe they they found someone who wants a seriously I mean there's a number of things yeah I wish I wish had a more concrete answer for that but unfortunate I do not let's go with over here yeah okay approaches there how much time you say it takes before you  well you know obviously it's going to be contingent upon rather I'd say there's a direct correlation to how frequently you go out and how how quickly you get better at it right so again think of it like going to the gym so if you go out you know one day a week it's probably better than nothing but you know you're not likely to see like dramatic quick success on the other hand if you're going out like three to five that's pretty good if you're not six seven now you might get injured right and what's injuring the game probably you just get sick of fucking going out or you'd burn out like you get fired from your fucking jobs you're showing up hungover and shit so I personally been fired from every job I ever had I'll probably be fired from this one as well when I like punch Tyler's kid in the fucking head or something like like when I hug Duke in fucking Tyler's kid but but but the fucking the anthem answered the definitive answer that question is if there is no definitive answer how long is it going to take however long it fuck it takes you know what I'm saying for me I wasn't like because a lot of guys ask that shit I never asked how long it's gonna take I never asked that you know why I figured it's going to take colors a to take it's going to take to like die it's like it's like the gym right again you're not gonna get to a point either where you're like okay I'm fucking jacked gym done right no more gym I'm at the point I want to be at right it's like you got to keep fucking going and it's like you got to understand like with life there's going to be things you have to do always you always have to breathe you always have to eat some people like god I fucking hate eating such a chore takes so much time where other people are like you know I really enjoy a good steak I also enjoy this like that like you can find enjoyment in so you've got to find enjoyment in the process that's what's going to keep you going back because the last thing you want is to hate going to the gym do you hate going to the gym you're not gonna go now granted I get it sometimes you don't wanna go in you want to fucking go out some want it like I said in that like that that trailer video Mikey's got to get out of the fucking house that's the number one thing get out of the fucking house and now often times you like small chunking right you're like well if I go out I'm going to have to take a shower I'm gonna have to put some shoes on I'm going to have to get in the car I'm gonna have to drive down there I'm have to find parking you have to queue up I'm gonna have to get into place I'm gonna have to find my friends then I'm gonna have to start approaching her like no don't think of it like that what are the steps to go out go outside that's the fucking step like go outside you're fletcher's get out at the fucking door and the shit is for me the front of the night is I never know what's going to happen to you like that's why I have you as an adventure it's I never know what's gonna happen you never know which girl is going to pull the girl you speak to it fucking 10 15 the beginning of the night the girl you talked to at 2:30 on the fucking Street right you never fucking know and all it takes is one good set to turn your whole night around like I can have a shit night I'm like dude I'm going to keep on to the bitter end site it just takes one fucking interaction turn it around so again you want to start viewing is like an adventure now realistically how long it'll take for me personally and this is for me and it depends how smart you are - okay so if you're a fucking dummy you might take you a little longer because you're not going to be aware of what you're doing wrong and I'd be able to correct it like I said the guy who gets good the quickest more the most quickly is the guy who puts himself in the cross and is able to be honest about where he's fucking up and take action to correct it so for me though I say the first year was really engine earing my belief systems the second year was me um what he called uh learning the nuts and bolts mechanical aspects of game and getting that dialed and then the third was stepping up the level of challenge I viewed it like a four year course but the thing is like I mean dude I would say my best game that I ever had was this summer and I continuing to improve right at age 40 I had him well thirty nine eleven twelve I I you know I never thought that I'd have like we have in my best fucking game at age fucking forty and I got expected next year to be better right so again just strive for continual improvement be happy about where you're at I mean what's your results like now no no the point where it's more or less alternating like that old girls like they're gone by the second day the back end up getting attached to me and to keep seeing each other which is great but I kind of like it tomorrow I start getting more numbers I think some people under my deal for way of a pretty demanding career at more time to devote to this I'm trying to set up like what expectations from you so again dude just just give it it give it a year and see where you're at and then reassess from there if you're if you feel your sale the same thing they're obviously doing something wrong fuel you're still the same level a year you're doing something wrong and you need to assess like where am I fucking up right that's the biggest thing always ask your friends what can I do different because your friends are going to be able to see things that you're not seeing that's why that's why it's important to have a wing to yeah blue hoodie okay here's a bucket thing drinking iced drink very very heavily and I now I don't dribble them gaming okay at most I'll have like one beer just a you know just have a beer in the club or whatever but generally I feel it's a handicap okay it's a fucking handicap and what I mean by that is it's like a golf handicap where it's something I do to make it fair for the other players right it makes it fair for the girl so if I'm like sober it's ridiculous by the end of the night I'm like fucking Einstein to these people right they're like a holy shit this guy's a fucking genius like oh my god it's like it's like Stephen Hawking without the wheelchair maybe slightly better looking yeah so it's like you can run verbal circles around these people and but for me really what it's about again you can run verbal circles around people like just ridiculous like you're stunting all over them just like you're doing like some like fucking like endzone dance and shit like stole like people like guys trying to fucking talk to you like move into the other loo destroyed like and then furthermore you can orchestrate the pole really well so that's the thing drinking it's not going to make you miss it like I say it'll make you sloppy like for me I noticed it makes me sloppy so if I have more than two drinks over the course of the night what I find happens is this I get sloppy and and I don't mean like this I'm like you know stumbling drunk sloppy necessarily but you're going to miss small windows of opportunity so say for example you're going out and or you got a girl with you and you go for the pole you pull her outside of the club and there's a cab right there and you're like okay I'm going to do the pole I guess I should get into that cab okay all right that's we're doing okay and then while you were thinking that some other person gets in the cab and other cabs gone and now you're like oh shit well I guess I better hail the cab then and as you're hailing it the friends come out there you are Sarah hey what's going on oh hey nice to meet you Poe if you like god damn it okay so it's not it doesn't mean you're stumbling drunk but again shit happens quick and field you fucking know this right if you're out at all you know that there's like windows of opportunity and when those windows pass shit's fucked like the shit changes quickly so that's number one if I have more than that then I start making the actual stupid mistakes like forgetting her name I'm saying shit that I said but saying like the exact same line I said previously shit like that you know she's like you already said that oh my god you already said it twice that's the third time  it's like watching a car crash happen in slow motion I've had a like god damn it to drug to drug right so but what I do personally um when I'm in the club if I'm like I don't drink when I'm gaming I drink at home alone is God intended but you know I'm saying like but um and so but but what I'm gaming yeah I find it's just terrible like if I'm out there to get laid much much better - but the thing is what I'll say it was you might be like how do I not fucking drink because we're so engrained to drink in the club like when I go in the club I it's a kinesthetic memory you know it's like it's here like this is what I do I have like a beverage so I'm kind of liquid that I'm pouring in my fucking Bible like right so so again when I go into the club first thing I'll do if I don't want to drink I grab a water immediately or a Red Bull or whatever the fuck you knows I just want some beverage in my hand you know so as long as I have that I'm like oh yes I'm drinking clearly I'm drinking I'll even say to myself sometimes like when I first stopped drinking I would say years ago when I first stopped tricky when I was gaming I said uh no alcohol until you hit state right so until I like I've gone up and like now I'm enthusiastic about doing the next approach instead of apprehensive and so once I hit that state though typically what I found was that I didn't even want the damn drink anymore like waste of time waiting the fucking blind the bar what the fuck waste of time I could be beasting yeah come here right so so again just grab a drink putting your hand play games with yourself like that and personally yeah person I find it's much much easier like I said it's unfair almost yeah in the back sorry in the way back and then we'll do the guy the bald turtleneck fellow yes so this year  process levels of not attractive way more sense now it's it's cool I think I have because there's like age of nine I'm actually gonna try to yeah I didn't get a Monty - I didn't say Nick you're talking about textile making see that yeah oh I hope to be just feeling good more and how many sevens have you fucked how many 7s have you calculated with lifetime okay who can't count you literate you don't fucking know what we mean how many ballpark it ho fifteen fifty okay so fuck fifty more then you'll never want it fuck it seven again like Villard literally that's how I did it that's how I did it that's how I did I fucked like two hundred seven okay you you want it you want to like not eat pizza anymore eat pizza every day for a fucking year like literally the pizza analogy you know like yeah no but seriously like that and Tyler talks about this a lot too as you get older like it like I said almost 40 so I you know I fucked you know 300 something girls this point you know and I've taken a little hiatus in between and shall I get but but again at this point like you're Kate as you get older and you have sex with like getting into the hundreds and hundreds it's like like if I fuck some seven quote-unquote you know she's perfectly cute girl you know but I've probably slept with this same girl probably like 12 to 20 times do you know I mean it's like okay yeah I've done this 12 to 20 times before right so you get bored with it you literally can't do it anymore you literally can't even you can't even bother be fucked right so for me if I go and I you get very specific tastes like a very specific taste like there's there I want that one and then I want the other one with the thing and I want that like I have different ones yeah so I'll be out like it would like one that looks like this one that looks like this like I have different like I guess blueprints so I'll be out at the club and I don't do spam approach anymore but what I'll do if I'm out on my own like I'll kind of chill in the venue and I'll scope around I'll scope around them like okay that one I like that one I like that one and that one and I'll kind of play it out I'll see and then like at some point I'll even scope it out until to the point where I'll wait until it's like the good time to approach now for guys just starting out I don't say it don't do that don't like wait until it seems like it's a good time to approach because it's when you're just starting out you just got to over the hump and just fuckin approach you know I mean you don't to be like Oh will the friends they're all the friends leave to do the only time that I would say that is if they're like conducting a transaction you know if they're about if their walk just walked up to the bar and the bartender is about to come over and you're like hey can I take your order oh you know that's that's always going to be stupid but if you're like waiting for like oh the friends there I'll wait for the friend to leave more friends could fucking come they could leave and I have it sometimes where they leave and I'm like god damn it but still I'm more like a like a sniper approach these days and that's what you're going to STATS what you can aspire to when you get like way up there but but again newer guys like it's like doing the dishes it's never going to be better later you know what I mean like you don't want to crust up on there and shit you just get it fucking done I just go do the fucking approach but um yeah you will develops more specific tastes like I can't eat the pizza anymore you know what I'm saying and it's not because like if entitlement issue it's just like dude I'm just fucking bored with it so yeah yeah exactly I mean personally I feel like um but when I do see like the one that I haven't got with yet I no longer feel intimidated necessarily maybe a little but you know because you never you know if you're not a natural if you want to like didn't learn the shit growing up there's always going to be that little inkling in the back of the head in fact that's why I like it's interesting my game becomes like seven to ten percent better if I'm when I'm gaming the girl there's a mirror behind her because I go like this I can be like bah bah bah bah oh yeah oh right oh right you're cool now right like I'm like oh yeah right I'm fucking cool now like I forget you know it's even better if they have like if they have like glasses that I can see myself in whoo that's like 12 that's like 12 15 percent I have a toy with an idea of getting like a mask that's a mirror and like here hold on one second you mind putting this on your face so when I'm talking it's like I'm talking my own fucking face and I can like make out with myself now that was probably be like a 20% improvement in my game,R7nvQV5CWpk
welcome to yet another edition of teenage landlord Obama's wizard cult and today I wanted to talk a little bit about kung-fu and how I'd become a vampire recently and how I'm kind of really integrating my vampire powers with my wizard powers and now my my my new kung fu mastery so it's quite a formidable combination and the reason that I have been you know assembling all the these powers and and accumulating all these accruing if you will all these various supernatural and supernatural powers is because well you know it's a contingency planning because there's been some rumors lately that evil Julian might be might be coming back an evil brainwashed Julian you know who's going to return to his evil ways and you know just like Batman has a contingency plan to stop everyone one of the Justice League should they be brainwashed or go insane or you know or whatever turn evil I I have this as well and so so again I you know I I've mastered the art of non chokku the ancient Chinese weapon and I know in the comments a lot of people are going to say you know that's a that's a Japanese weapon but no it's actually a Chinese kung-fu weapon that was developed from gardening to like a gardening flail used to separate wheat from chaff back in the day and so I think between between those those skills and my you know what my supernatural wizardry combined with the near immortality that is granted by me having become a vampire I think I think I'll be able to I'm out I mean hopefully it's not gonna come to that you know but again you know it's like the Boy Scout motto right always be prepared and I'll be there and I'll have my fucking nunchucks and my wand and my ability to transform into a cloud of bats and you know i'ma fuck him up i'ma fuck his ass up and I don't care who I don't care who turns evil cuz I got to continually plan for all of them you know Tyler turns evil you know I don't want to reveal the secret but it's in the Bible the secret to destroying Tyler is in the Bible in the and in fact half of these motherfuckers the secrets are all in the in the Bible there to destroy them Tyler Max is also unsusceptible that particular type of attack and oddly enough it pertains to Jezebel not the subsidiary of Gawker that the feminist blog but rather the biblical figure who I I believe had recalling this correctly stripped the hero Samson of all of his superhuman strength by shaving his hair off so with Tyler all we got to do he's got to cut that fucking beard off while he sleeps and you know and again being a vampire I can easily sneak into his home I can just you know mind-control his fucking kids to open the door for me let invite me in and then just cut that shit off and then he's fucking done same with max the only thing about Max is you know he might again all the steroids that Max is clearly on he could put up a bit of a fight I don't know if he matches I don't I don't know if he's not vampire strength but yeah he could put up a bit of a fight yeah I'm feeling pretty good about it those are my contingency plans for any member of rst turns evil but in the meantime I'm just kind of chilling here I'm seeing what's going on I just unpacked some Amazon's stuff we got like the days the weeks delivery fucking a fucking condoms what I wanted to do with this I wanted to make like a UH like a bandolier you know just like where this shit out at the club like a fucking like a hanging you know bandolier IV pretty dope by the way if you're interested in in not getting people pregnant if that's something that interests you or you know if you're also interested in you know protecting yourself from sexually transmitted diseases if you're interested in having sex with what seems like a fucking plastic bag on your dick if you're interested in eating a sandwich with the with the the sandwich bags still on it as Owen describes sex with a condom these are my personal favor of these are the the trojan bear skin these are the ones to me that feel at least the the least fucked up right and still not so ideal but i would go so far as say it is the the least fucked up I'm actually headed down to the the free tour in Los Angeles I'm gonna be running that event with Owen and filming some videos down there for the entire week just to get more awareness out for the upcoming resonator program which is mm solely focused on voice vocal projection and how to modulate your voice and obviously it's pretty crazy because when I created this program like most of it's in the can I'm putting supplemental things in it now like adding some in fields and things of that nature kind of like demonstrating the techniques live in field and so forth but damn I learned so much I thought I knew about voice but I I didn't you know I didn't you know and it's it's when you humble yourself not just in this area but in any area and you realize that your time is valuable and I think we learned that lesson back in the early 2000s because we you know to learn pickup we basically had to develop most of this stuff yeah of course there was the you know the precursor stuff like the Ross Jeffries and the in the mystery method the nascent techniques and things of that nature but most of it most of it we had to suss hunt-and-peck out in the dark and so now when I see kids taking a bootcamp Otzi whatever you know any sort of program in and and these young guys started from scratch and getting good much much more quickly than than we did it just goes to show if you are able to set the ego aside and look into professional assistance you know from people who have made this whatever area it is their life's work you're going to learn a lot it's gonna blow your fucking mind you know and so I was working with Susan Nance who's a local classical voice trainer and I administer taught me so many things about my voice and that's my voice like my posture because oddly enough your voice all sounds strange right but your voice all starts from your posture and that was kind of a mind blower for me because you know I thought it's not posture oh you know it makes you look more confident or something like that but it actually it actually effects the alignment of all of the components that comprise the the vocal apparatus you know from the diaphragm the esophagus the lungs the you know the epiglottis the vocal cords themselves the palate the nasal cavities all that but anyway long story short head and out yes I am heading down to the free tour this weekend in order to you know just kind of help out on a bootcamp and record some stuff with Owen down there will you play Nick Papa Co and the rst musical I don't know how this is gonna turn out I mean the thing is too it's like I'm not gonna quit my day job let's just put it that way but you know I'll jump at any chance to like fucking perform some little fucking song and dance it's weird too because you know something I'll be it up I'll be I'll be here at the house with some girl or something I'll be like perform a dance and it's interesting to see how people react when you when you say that to them like when I girls there and I'm like perform a dance and some get like very like pissed off like to be at what no I'm not going to perform a dick it's for you my bitch I didn't say for me I just perform a fucking net what's what's the fucking problem I do you performed a dance I'm like okay  nunchucks nunchucks are actually illegal in California it's a felony to possess nunchucks to possess two sticks with a small length of chain or string between them it's a racist law that was created in 1974 when the Bruce Lee movies were at the peak of their popularity and you know I guess at the time motherfuckers we're going around with nunchucks and shit which is weird because a baseball bat is probably more harmful than fucking nunchucks cuz like look dude any moron can pick up a baseball bat and fuck someone up with it nunchucks unless you are a master of none chokku like like myself you're more likely to actually hurt yourself with the nunchucks so you know it's like you really got to have mastery of it and you know you again being a wizard and a wizard vampire helps a lot because you know my reflexes are heightened and so I'm probably you know my my spacial awareness is improved and so I'm highly unlikely to hit myself in the face with the nunchucks yeah that's why Chuck Norris was a Texas Ranger by the way not a California Ranger instead but baseball bat are not made for hurting people neither's nunchucks obviously you aren't aware okay obviously you aren't aware of the storied history of nunchucks there's a gardening tool how long have I been practicing sorcery ever since Hogwarts you know I I've got a couple of these I've got a couple tomes here that relate to you know the wizardry and I'll show you a couple see what's ago this is all this is a good one I just got here the secrets of the German sex magicians  the secrets of the German sex magicians by ferrate UD so let's read a little bit about German sex magicians here we have a picture of the chod okay the perineum and the chod is the point located between your excretory organs imagine the skin of the chod presses against the base of the spinal cord when breathing out relax after about 10 breaths repeat the exercise again so this is going to strengthen your pelvis and your chode so when you want to you know do that Avada Kedavra you can really hmm what do you think about Susan Rice unmasking names that were surveilled during Trump transition perhaps illegally I think nothing about that in fact I had been disengaging from all the Trump shit you know it's like look he's gonna do something fucked up every fucking day like he's gonna say something fucking weird he's gonna do something weird every single day so you know you can't you cannot engage with that stuff all the time you know you cannot engage that stuff all the fucking time you know you you just have to kind of I think engage with it on a limited basis you know that you feel is necessary with your ability to affect it so again if you're fucking you know Chuck Schumer you the Senate Minority Leader then yeah you should be thinking about it all the fucking time okay if you're like a homeless person or some fucking pickup artist on YouTube well maybe again my ability to my ability to affect the Trump administration it is very limited.i I do have a subscription to the failing New York Times I guess that's my that's my little contribution there you know I think The Times is pretty good actually I think even in the height of like the scandals that you know rst was embroiled in or whatever like the at the times was fairly even-handed and didn't like publish straight fabrications and things of that nature like they were they were pretty fair insofar as you know the the overall media was concerned so you know I believe that it's important because the thing is why does why does the you got to accept your own culpability in this shit you know to an extent I mean obviously I'm not gonna sit here and say that I'm personally responsible for the media being a shit show but you kind of are because you're the one that consumes the clickbait if it didn't work they wouldn't do it you know what I mean now granted one could also discuss how they've become these for-profit enterprises where in the past the news was essentially a loss leader for corporations that were providing it as a public service and then of course the shift to again it being a for-profit enterprise introduced you know the Craven behaviors that that we see today but again you're the one that fucking clicks on that shit see the fucking slide show of ten celebrities that fucking and fuck themselves in the ass you know or whatever right so yeah I mean again I I just try to I try to disengage from that stuff as much as possible these days cuz otherwise just go insane man I don't know it's very depressing I don't know I I shouldn't even be talking about this shit didn't I just say that I'm just some pickup fag and I shouldn't be discussing these things didn't I literally just say that ask me something about boobs okay so ask me about boobs that's all I'm good for really it's all I'm fucking good for but seriously though I think that we're on the brink of something's got to change man and I think we really to cultivate empathy you know we've really got to start to just to cut this somehow somehow find common ground because otherwise I mean the way that shit is now I mean we again back in the day oh la dee da you know some futile cunt wants to go to war with some other King oh you know a bunch of people die with a sword now we can literally destroy the whole fucking planet and again a lot of you little Millennials okay they don't remember being in school and and being taught the drill of what happens when the nuclear attack happens get under your desk yeah that's gonna I'm sure that oh that's gonna save it get under your net get on your fucking desk and like having just again the idea in your mind from like age when you know age five like oh there there's the Russians and they can nuke us and we can all die in like a thermonuclear explosion like Terminator 2 where she's grabbing the fence and she's getting blasted away by the fucking shockwave don't get me wrong I don't like Trump I think he's a buffoon he's a fucking uh it's me it's the typos man you know that's what really does it for me it's the fucking typos like I don't think I mean call me old-fashioned the president shouldn't make fucking typos that genies out of the bottle have you seen the guy who whipped his dick out in front of hundred of protesting feminists first of all you sound like a racist caricature have you seen guy who take dick out in front of hundreds feminists have you seen guy and yeah I've seen that and that thing's like ten years old and a way to fucking like reheat some old crusty fucking leftover meme bro meme leftovers we don't like that here we want dank fresh memes okay we want fresh memes dank fresh means that you can you can smell the freshness we're doing some Street interviews for resonator just kind of like talking to girls so stopping them on the street running them through some of the exercises and then we're uh we're asking them shit like so what do you think when a guy comes up to you in the club and you can't like understand what he's saying or he has like a meek sort of you know kind of weak voice and blah and the reactions are hilarious a man should be a man he shouldn't sound like a fucking female like talking so much shit like he sounds like a bitch and all this shit but like I just think he's a bitch I want him to leave oh you oh you oh you feel that he's a bitch you'd let you'd like him to leave oh so yeah if you look at this here again this is a it's called a kitchen safe and so what this is for it's for like fat people to like put their candy in or whatever right and so you know if you look closely you can see it's got a countdown on it and if this shit will not open until until the final countdown and so the night before just that's like one of the last thing I do before I go to bed my little ritual I put all the weed in there i lock it I usually set it to like 5 p.m. the next day because otherwise it's very easy to simply you know wake up in the morning and it you know this is true it takes you it takes you about 45 minutes for your brain to kind of really boot up where it's operating you know from a deep slumber where it's operating it like peak efficiency so again it's very easy if you've got weed laying out you're not even thinking especially if it's habitual already you can just go you know mindlessly this is the and then your day is fucked your whole day is fucked you're just sitting there watching Rick and Morty and your day is done ok so I I find it's a way for me to get around that not allowed to say well does have fucking self-control just have does have self-control don't smoke that weed boy right well I know myself and I know that I'm gonna be susceptible to that so I believe Anthony Bourdain he said he said something along the lines of like every morning when I wake up a battle begins and it's a battle with a version of me that just wants to smoke weed watch TV fuck around like look like look at the at reddit all day and then go and get drunk at night like like this guy doesn't want to engage with the work right if you've read Steven Pressfield the war of art one of my favorite books actually talks about the concept of resistance where you know what you've got to do but you instead either do you know snacking or smoking weed or meaningless sex or even even something like cleaning the house can be a way to like oh I'm just gonna clean up look at clean up you know and and that's a way to avoid doing the work the work whatever the work is for you right but again the resistance that is a compass that's your true north whatever you're feeling the most resistance to that's the thing you should be doing but regardless back to the main point I have to figure out tricks and gambits to defeat this this guy this version of me that just wants to be you know the lie about slacker my whole life professional life I guess has begun to revolve around streamlining processes streamlining workflows and again avoiding those pitfalls of resistance another big one is now you might have noticed you know I had been doing these kind of live live blogs a lot more and also you know you'll see the same background a lot and the reason for that I was talking actually Brandon Carter about this you know the the BBC big Brandon big be that dude you know he's very prolific with his videos he does like so many fucking videos and I'm like how do you do it man like we were hanging out some party and I was like dude how do you do it he's like dude he's like I had that she just set up in my house I don't even have to set it up I don't have to pull any equipment out it's dedicated to that spot the lights are in place all I got to do is sit down and hit record and I'm like dude yeah because again a big part of the my at least in my case a lot of resistance to putting out more videos more consistently was always like well you know it you you got a sin it up you got to drag it out you got to set it up get the lighting and get the settings blah blah blah blah all that it's the same kind of thing when a guy doesn't want to go to the club right cuz they they small chunk it in their mind they're like well you know I've got to get my shoes on I gotta get ready comb my hair get in the car drive down there find the park and get into the place settle in find my home you like start doing the approaches blah blah blah like they just small chunk it it's like no dude it shouldn't be that it should speak go it should be go outside right and if you've got processes that you can add on top of that to make it easier and easier decision for you to leave and just hit hit it that's gonna serve you much much better long term make it a no-brainer to just do the shit just set it up and go so by the way if you haven't read that book war the war of art by Steven Pressfield I it's very it's very short but extremely valuable it's one thing that I'm always revisiting it's one of the books that I read visit a lot because I think we all struggle with procrastination and and avoidance of work but strangely enough and you know this too you know you know it but even knowing it doesn't let you it doesn't doesn't fix it like I know that once I start doing the work like what's like for me a huge thing is writing I love writing right and when I get into it I'm like I'm much flying' i I might as well be like playing the piano my cousin didn't do didn't I look yes yes yes oh that would be a good word choice I love how that sentence flows okay let's move this here all that's more impactful and I get off on it man like I fucking get off on it same with like going onstage you know you know a lot of times I'll be at like a free tour event or something and I'm not scheduled to and I'm just kind of showing up to like hang out and like hang out with the boys and just show my face there and then Owen will be like hey man go up on stage like I wanna back I'm not gonna be there I'm late you know surprise surprise someone's late right but he's like go up on stage and you know hold the crowd so I get there I'm like god dammit motherfucking Owen don't know but then once I get up there I'm like oh and like then when he shows up I don't want to get off the stage cuz like that's my zone right same thing would like travel you know a lot of times I'll be like oh god you know I gotta go travel I'm gonna be away from the my home and and you know all my cool shit to here and my pets and my friends and that but then once you get on the road I'm like oh yeah this is awesome I love it here this is the shit I wish I fuckin lived here you know so and I'm and I make it easy on the travel to like literally I have like a separate set of everything so I don't even have to pack it's just all there like a separate set of shoes identical a separate set of clothes like identical a separate set of like toiletries like it doesn't even need to be packed I just like pick it up and fucking go and like as soon as I return home from a trip I'll like replenish what needs to be replenished wash what needs to be washed and just like set it up again so when I go it's just like boom grab and go so again I think there is one takeaway from this from this it would be that it's just the idea of streamlining processes and you know setting up ways for you to avoid those traps that you know you fall into that prevent you from doing what you know you supposed you're supposed to be doing for doing what you supposed to be doing right you know and all of us are susceptible that even a even a vampire wizard who's a master of nunchucks now I'm sure that many of you would like to see some of my nunchuck re in action however I don't know I don't know if I don't know if y'all ready for that yet I don't know if you're ready and and furthermore I kind of don't want to reveal my my moves I don't want someone to I don't want to enemies to kind of see this and be able to get a sense of my timing and and and my my defaults and things of that nature so but maybe one day yeah mate perhaps one day I I will reveal all of that and maybe it'll be next week in fact maybe it'll be you next week but only if you like and subscribe you have to smash that fucking like button and subscribe and then you'll see me turn into a bat one thing that I've been doing recently is I'm now eating garlic whole I'm eating like whole cloves of fucking garlic and I don't I heard it was good for you but I just kind of like it's just like fucked up I just like it you eat this shit this is like it's like holy shit what the fuck is this this is doing to me it's pretty awesome but minimalism you know I'm really getting I'm starting to investigate stoicism a lot more and I think that's a great I think stoicism it's a great philosophy for the Trump era you know because again you've got to engage with the things that you can actually have an effect on right because that's what our se is really all about it's being at the cause not just like being in reaction to things and if there's something that's beyond your control and you're just like constantly in reaction to it your life is just gonna be you're gonna feel helpless you know you're gonna feel adrift you're gonna feel you know feelings of ennui and fucking existential terror and you know the stoicism philosophy is like you know worry about what you can worry about and keep keep very grounded I'm reading right now it's a super short book Marcus Aurelius meditations so I might do a quick like a quick little book review of that next week until then I guess I'll see you guys next time like and subscribe and be sure if you want more updates on the resonator program which we're gonna start like really digging into the tentative date right now is June 21st but you can go right now to our SD resonator comm and get on the VIP interest list to be informed whenever any new materials I put out pertaining to this program come out yeah rock and fucking roll god bless america [Music] you,RGNKdlGWZnI
welcome back mr. boy Jeffy and today it's a Monday afternoon here in San Francisco California and coming off a bootcamp this weekend I just had three threesomes in one weekend and I probably did about five approaches the entire weekend so I'm on fucking fire so what I got to do now it's all on tape hashtag Jeffy hot seat number two but before I get down to editing that shit I figured that I take a little minute here to slam out a little super-powered blog of delight and destiny so what I got in my mind today is some more kind of inner game type stuff specifically I'd like to talk a little bit about beliefs and about the very nature of reality as it relates to picking up women so your beliefs that things that you hold to be true are very important in this game as they're gonna invariably affect how you're coming across to the women that you're interacting with in any given situation okay so and with that with that as a given what exactly is truth so in ordinary life we define truth as what really exists what a person really knows in said however truth consist of something that's not actually in existence but which could happen for example when let's say you go in to talk some girls you open you open them up and you assume attraction you go in holding the belief that she's already attracted to you now this may or may not actually be the case but you're going in with that belief and what's significant here is the reality of the inner life of a person interacting Society and is belief in that reality where what we're talking about here we're not concerned with the actual naturalistic existence of what surrounds us when we're out doing pickup or the actual reality of the material world the objective reality that's obviously the basis of where we're coming from but when you're in set when you're in the club and I've said this before to me this is my favorite skill my favorite game my favorite hobby if you will because to me it's like lucid dreaming when I'm actually out there in the club because what's happening is I'm actually changing things with my words and my actions so when you have a strong belief in your internal reality this is what we're talking about when we say that you need to maintain a strong frame okay in other words you've got to have an unshakable belief that your particular perspective is the correct one okay the one that corresponds with objective reality so to speak even if outside circumstances seem to indicate otherwise that's where a strong frame is so what you got to do is put life breathe life into all of the imagined circumstances and actions that you must go in to set with that is assume attraction assumed rapport until you've completely satisfied your own personal sense of this being true and you've sort of awake in a sense of faith in the reality of these sensations as you experience them truth becomes pretty much whatever we believe in with sincerity which is a very American way to look at things I think you ever heard that Marilyn Manson song were from America he says one of the lyrics is we believe in everything we say and we say it because we believe in vote Trump Rodman 2016 so I digress but but the point is everything that you do in set must inspire belief in the possibility that this is how things are that the frame of your setting is the consensus reality and each and every moment that you're interacting with the girl must be saturated with a belief in the truthfulness of whatever emotion you're trying to get involved with with that so look I know personally there are some guys who are so strict with themselves in adhering to you know the objective truth that they often carry that attitude without even mean conscious of it to extremes that amount to falseness in and of themselves okay like for example there's some guys in the forum I know that they're obsessed with the idea that you know you you have to be tall you have to have you have to be rich you have to be white you know things of this nature things that are outside of their control that they continually bemoan right now look the looks matter thing I mean that's been literally beaten to fucking death at this point like yeah do girls like a guy that looks good sure right but if you're gonna like be labor that point over and oh well that's the objective reality that's reality that's reality that's reality again that's its own sense of falseness that's its own fucking weird falseness okay so the point is you shouldn't exaggerate your your preference for objective truth and your and your abhorrence of lies because it tends to make you overplayed truth for its own sake and again one could argue that that is in fact the worst lie of all so again we're in set you want to be truck you want to be a cool you want to be impartial remember that reality in and of itself is by its very nature a subjective experience right you can even get some use from so-called falseness if you're reasonable in your approach to it what it does is it's gonna set the pitch for you and kind of show you what you should not do okay another slight such conditions you can use a slight error to determine the line that you shouldn't cross and what am I talking about here let's say that you're going up to the girl and your shit just isn't fucking connect whatever you're saying to her it's just not fucking connecting on a real emotional level with her and maybe when that happens you start like spitting out more lines and like routines and she had like just I see this happen with like especially newer guys it they'll go in and they're they're not gonna go to reaction so they can they're like grasping for the good reaction so they start to spit out more weird shit that's they're not congruent with and we're going to compensate like okay maybe if I throw out more material more attract material then it'll compensate for this like lack of connection right here and it's funny because this can even happen this can happen at all levels this can even happen you know what happened to me the other night like a few couple weeks ago I was out with my girl and we had just come off some fucking amazing string of successes you know bang bang bang and when we were interacting with these girls we were kind of high off our own supply so to speak and so uh you know we came off really arrogant and the girls were kind of looking at us like who the fuck who the fuck are you it like it wasn't connecting so what do we do we double down and we started to say more weird shit and eventually the girls was like okay bye it fucked off so again whether you're doing that you know you're sort of grasping at that falseness at a high level or whether using it as a crutch as a beginner it's essentially the same thing so this is again ultimately what we call incongruity and women can of course sense it very very well so always and forever when you're interacting with women you must be present and you must be yourself now sometimes a guy achieves some sort of accidental success in or in an interaction and they want to repeat it and so what they'll do is they want to get back at those feelings directly that that frame that they had before you know and they want to sort of conjure that up by mechanically repeating the things that they did whether whether the behaviors or the words as a quote-unquote routine so you know and Tyler did a video about this called how yesterday is epiphany becomes tomorrow's crutch or something like that check it out if you want to kind of explore that idea further but you know when you are and another thing for okay example of this there's a video I show students of infield where I'm it's my first approach of the night and I go up and I say to the girls excuse me I was wondering if you noticed how ridiculously fucking cool I look okay and it's interesting because the previous week I had said the exact same opener I was the first time I ever said that opener because I to myself in the mirror I looked real fucking cool and I was like damn I look fucking cool I had a mullet I had a shirt that said Lamborghini on it I had these creepy like rapist sunglasses on they looked like what do they call that transition lenses let you know like looks like a molester dude it just look badass like like a super weird molester like who's awesome or something so I rolled up and I said it I was like damn excuse me I was wondering you notice how ridiculously fucking cool I look and they're like haha it totally worked so then about a week later my assistant starts counting me down from 30 playing the 30 second game with me and he's like 30 29 where they punch you in the arm bit theta0 it's my first approach of the night I haven't even I'm not warmed up not that I really need to warm up per se that much anymore but in the moment he just like spring and I mean I'm like oh oh oh I gotta go I gotta go and I'm just thinking like I don't want to get punched I'm on the line here what am I gonna say what am I gonna say uh oh I remember last week I said that thing about how ridiculously fucking cool I look oh that'll be good right so I said the same words verbatim but again the first time was coming from place was spontaneity and the second time was coming from a place of trying to impress the girls so while it worked awesome the first time the second time what excuse me I was wondering if you noticed how ridiculously fucking cool I look same words but this time it comes off fucking super dork trihard lame and the girls are just like fuck off okay so again when you're grasping at those you know those old routines and those old mechanics trying to recreate those feelings the thing is that's that's almost like trying to grow a flower without the cooperation of nature so look you want to be aware of the end game obviously and have it clearly in mind you want to think about the desired outcome and you know how exactly the pole is gonna go down stuff like that when you wouldn't before you've even approached but again when opening set your mind to work on what actually makes the interaction grow right with the feelings and the dynamics that are unfolding right in front of you for a moment to moment and of course once you get basic game mechanics dialed well the result will appear in in due time as the logical outcome of what has gone before in your actions now again on the surface these might seem like some fairly esoteric concept but to any guys who are out there watching this and who are in field consistently you guys will understand immediately what I'm getting at here all right nothing beats field experience no amount of intellectualizing or watching of YouTube gurus even as one as as me can replace good old-fashioned field work all right and again that's something that's what makes our live in field boot camps such an incredible value and so powerful as a transformative tool because we're actually getting in there again if you can take a boot camp as long as you're getting in the gym and hammering out yourself you're on the right path so anyway I'm gonna sign off for today until next time take care of yourselves  you,RLscTqkydLk
confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion  yo yo yo what up mr. boy Jeffy I'm comin at you today from a downtown Miami Florida you can see behind me a lot of construction going on it's a very up-and-coming neighborhood evidently but today I want to talk to you about the tactical side of the pickup game I know with RSD a lot of times we get this rap as sort of being more esoteric abstract sort of inner game based thing stuff like having self-esteem versus ego being outcome independent and so on and so forth however anyone who's taken an RSD program or a boot camp you know that we do actually delve into the other side of things as well that would be the more tactical side on my bootcamp particularly on the second day I get more of a much more of a structured look at things like do this do that do this do that do that ABCDE and so on and so forth and so again I'm kind of delve into that today because I recently got an email from alumni and any alumni of mine I respond to very quickly via email and he said the following I said Jeff I'm having trouble escalating intimacy attraction and chemistry and this leads back to the first bullet point of your areas of improvement in your final notes after boot camp to not communicate as a friend to a friend but rather as a man to a woman can you give me some clarification and examples of the following statements of intent push polls misinterpretation shock questions role plays and free associating in sexual direction so let's kind of break these down one by one so first off regarding statements of intent now what is a statement of intent okay a statement of intent is really the verbal component of what we call mantled communication now obviously the flip side musical hand at hand is going to be physicality and escalating in a physical way and without that of course statements the statements of intent really don't mean jack shit I mean that's not totally fair but to kind of get into that a little bit more I'm used to believe back when I first started out in the game that this is how attraction works first you go up and you like say awesome shit okay and give statements of intent and then the girl becomes then attracted then she gives indicators of interest and this then allows you to escalate okay nowadays my understanding of its kind of flipped okay not completely but a little bit flipped and meaning that you know the physicality is actually what's causing the attraction you understand meaning like again I don't give a fuck your Oscar fuckin wild you can be the wittiest motherfucker on earth but if you do not take your dick out you're not going to get laid ok I mean also the fact you're Oscar Wilde you're also super fucking gay but again that's neither here over there all right now of course that's not a completely valid look at things because I know for example my verbal game is very very good right not to toot my own horn but it's pretty fucking good and sometimes when I'm being witty I can actually see the girl becoming a trackage so I was talking to Tyler about this I was like how exactly is that what is that happening you know what's exactly going on there well let's think about that if you're if you have the ability to be witty what does that tell the girl number one you have a healthy brain and number two that you're able to be charismatic in a social pressure situation and that says a lot of very good things about you as well but again like I said you can have all the witticisms in the world at your disposal but at a certain point you're going to have to take your dick out okay so the physicality is what is causing the attraction that's what makes for pussy wet okay but you know primarily but the statement of intent can help as well so and again if you're in a situation we are constrained in your ability to do parkour physicality say for example add a game street set or something like that or just a time constraint situation where it's kind of inappropriate to do so you can compensate for that by tapping up statements of intent okay so again let's give some examples what does a statement on the 10 well what I'm asking physically I want to start off relatively innocuously okay and if you know are like seven steps physical a costing stack as we call it you'll notice starts out pretty innocently you know with like a high five or something like that and then before you know what you're like lifting her up your shoulder and like motorboating and so forth but there's a smooth escalation to it so the same is going to hold true for statements of a tenth the first thing i'm typically gonna say is something relatively innocuous okay i might say my you appear rather fashionable this evening are you a fashion person i love your look it's hot okay now again what does their look refer to that could be anything at beer fucking clothes that she chose for the evening her accoutrement it could mean her tits okay so again it's very sort of innocuous and then I might ramp it up some more I'd be like so were you always hot or were you like a nerd and then became hot all right and then next thing you know it's like even getting more and more it's like I'm like the Eskimo kiss your pussy I want to finger you with my penis I like to suck my own dick okay that's not really a statement of intent but you get the idea so again they start off a relatively innocuous and they ramp up now here's the thing you don't want to be like duck duck duck Duck Duck type that like machine-gunning these throughout the fucking interaction because normal people don't talk like that do you understand that's how like a crazy person aka a fucking PA who's gonna off the fucking deep end that's how they talk so again you don't want a machine-gun them but you're gonna pepper these in you know again vibing is going to form the meat and potatoes the foundation of your conversation and you're gonna pepper in these statements of intent now another thing to understand is a lot of guys is it won't it seem jarring when I just you know shoot these out out of the blue who gives a fuck like too many guys are laboring under the impression that you need to make logical sense and as you move from one topic to another like no I can just pack blah blah blah blah blah so yeah the sky is blue then a damn girl you making me feel weird in the dick haha so anyway didn't into the end and I just plow it under okay note you do not want to say these and then be like what do you think of that like looking for reaction like it's some big discreet separate thing and now it is time for the statement of intent oh you are hot how did she respond like again you again think of you're vibing that you know your conversation like a river and you're gonna drop these statements of ten they go broke and they just get carried off Oh they just get carried off so it becomes woven into the fabric of the interaction itself okay now the second point so those are statements of a Teta now the second point that he questioned was push polls now a push poll this is like an old school very very old school like tactic from the early days of pickup and you know this is basically it's very simple it's like you you give some sort of like validation and then you sort of negate it but in a funny way okay I guess isn't like some kind of like Julian stripping them a validation to get some kind of Stockholm Syndrome going on although that can be that can certainly be effective when used in certain scenarios but what we're talking about here is basic shit like some examples these might be Dan you're awesome sort of right or you know what I love about you absolutely nothing or you know it was another old-school one up damn girl you know you and I we would never get along we're too similar right we would just argue all the time and then we'd have freaky makeup sex and you know frankly I don't think I'm ready for one of those volatile relationships right now or maybe I am I'm so confused right so it's like push pull push pull push Paul see any others I have here  yeah yeah you're either really cool or a total fuckin weirdo I can't tell the difference and then by the way just as with statements of a tent you want to plow these under you don't want to be like again looking for reaction with any of these we did like these attractions spike and builders as we sometimes refer to them next one misinterpretations this is pretty pretty straightforward again if they basically you misinterpret anything they say as meaning they want to hook up with you and that's again you're taking it from the realm with all of these you're taking from the realm of platonic little conversation time right -  introducing the idea of you two hooking up in a romantic way all right because again if you don't take your dick out so to speak what you're going to get is every single fucking time you're gonna get the same exacting you get five to 10 minutes of polite conversation followed by what a hearty handshake and it was nice to meet you and the patronizing dog Pat like there you go little guy okay it's funny most guys don't understand what that means when they patcher in the back that basically means this it means you and I are never having sex that's what that's that means so when I get that it's like oh god damn it I wasn't man to woman you have right so again with a misinterpretation it could be anything like say she compliments anything about you anything at all right oh I love your shirt awesome so I guess you're ready to get out of here then huh dork and then like plow it under right um another example of misinterpretation  uh this is red 9-ball there's this one part where I'm like at a bar and I'm hitting on some girl and like she's a lesbian her girlfriends there and she's like hey bro yeah I love how your ass matches your face I'm like oh well cool yeah I guess I just got lucky I know they both look great right and then she's like uh she's like yeah I uh you know I at first when I met you I thought you were a cocksucker but then I realized I'm right and I was like hey dude I'm flattered but there's no way I'm sucking your cock okay so he's going to use to deflect like attacks it you know take a frame control but it can also be used to generate the idea to introduce the idea of you and the girl actually hooking up next one is shock questions okay and you know this is something you might want to ask Julian about actually because he's excellent this stuff but you know some basic examples this might be you know ask her have you ever hooked up with a girl right or asking her do you have sexy underwear on or do you have Costco underwear on like grandma underwear I get all my underwear from Costco and all my socks from Costco as well Beth socks you can get and if that's the only thing you get out of this video is to get your socks at Costco then this would be a great video for you to enhance your life so yeah that's shot questions role-plays now of course role plays it's an excellent way to introduce a man's woman dynamic into the interaction and for example what are some classic role plays one I love to use is the prom like would you accompany me may I be so bold as to inquire if you would accompany me to the prom or like if I asked you to the prom would you go with me if I wore a tuxedo would I be handsome  okay would I be handsome right um it's time for a dance and then you know initiate some sort of dance or something like that and they'll be like and then after the problem I'll try to fuck you in the back of my dad's car and I'll prematurely ejaculate because I'm a fucking chode the most magical night ever right stuff like that other examples of role players would be like you're my new blank you know bodyguard attorney girlfriend wife you know Eskimo whatever at anything you're my new ex and then you can kind of spin off of that and what these kind of tend to do is is really sort of contribute to that our world sort of mentality what to music all the the bubble of love where you actually have sort of some sort of relationship together as opposed to just this kind of like idiotic banal conversation in the club okay and then was the final one he asked about here  free associating in sexual direction now one of the major tenets of vai being is the idea of free association and basically this really requires a trust in your faculties okay a trust in your faculties and a trust that what comes out of your mouth is valuable in fact we have if you've ever you know read anything about RS T's concept of vibing you'll know that when vibing is it's basically just a non goal-oriented conversation that was designed to pump both your in her emotional state that's it there's no goal except to pump emotional state both yours and hers to contribute to that cascade of positive emotions that eventually leads to you hooking up so we have the vibe being there and I've said this before but we'll reiterate it very quickly there's a few beliefs that you want to have as you're vibing and believe number one is what I have to say is valuable because it comes from me belief number two is it's that she's not going to find it interesting because of the content but rather because of curiosity they want to know what does this person find interesting number three lower the bar for how good it has to be number four be in the moment don't think ahead and number five it's not what you say rather the energy behind it so when you've kind of internalized those beliefs this is what enables you to just blah blah blah blah blah and really have access to that free-flowing infinite amount of conversation okay and again many students come to me with this whole I run out of things to say issue and of course what is the root cause of running out of things to say well trying to impress again set it a lot before but think about this when you're close friends you don't run out of things to say why because you're not trying to impress that you don't care they've already accepted you so hence you can just pretty flow and oftentimes what happens is you say the most hilarious shit because you're not concerned about trying to impress you're not trying to micromanage their perception of you so anyway when you have these beliefs installed this is again it's going to enable you to just take whatever bubbles up in your mind Tim used to call it the magic 8-ball right you just shake it up and whatever comes up you just take and throw out he was taken throughout you you trust that if you throw it out enough something eventually stick and the gears will begin to imagine you get traction in a conversation and it's interesting because you know I've taken several courses I've taken I participated in several activities over the years which were designed to get me more comfortable being the center of attention I think I've talked about this in other videos too like karaoke improv comedy stand-up comedy now when I took the stand up I was the best guy in the class but I take an improv I fuck it sucked it's like a different thing you're on the spot but the most important thing I learned from improv is this if you're standing like on stage doing the skit and your partner says something and it's your turn to like talk if you can't think of the awesome funny thing to say it doesn't matter it's more important that you just say something okay you just say something and then hopefully they'll be able to say that they'll say something else and then that'll you'll be able to spin something off of that right that'll that'll carry the carry the skit forward its most important to keep the Skip alive all right that's that's the paramount thing and the same holds true when you're trying to pick up a girl you're interacting with a girl like just keep the conversation alive and trust that something will come of it now of course free association is going to be a big part of that you take whatever she says and you scan your brain and you just grab whatever comes out now when you're taking a sexual direction preferably what does that mean means you're going to take it you're going to select the thing that's the most sexual okay so say for example the girls like you know elephants right what are some things you can think of an elephant trainer Republican Party Dumbo the circus Africa tusks ivory big game never forgets huge dick elephants have a huge dick okay now it's my it's actually kind of stupid it's not even funny and it's like kind of a probably a bad example but still you get the point I want to take it in a sexual direction of course as with any of these you don't want to like be like dude what do you think of that like looking for reaction you just say it Slough it under and continue on okay so put it away pretty short little video here I'm just wanted to like run through a couple of those two in response to the students email and hopefully those give you a better idea of some simple attraction tactics quote-unquote that you can employ tonight when you go out in order to make your interactions more of a man to woman as opposed to a platonic friend a friend communication so this is Jeffy coming at you again from Miami Florida heading to New Orleans Mardi Gras aka redneck Vegas where the coolest guy

"um we'll do like a like a leisurely stroll okay your toes are really distracting something tried to look at that I don't know what you got going on there you got to get that you got to go to a doctor that's fucked okay that's fucked some something's wrong there dude okay okay that's like the B this outtakes video okay sorry sorry did it get like did a hammer go on it or something or okay that's just that's that's interesting okay perk you right up hmm all right shall we let's begin yo yo yo it is I your proverbial boy Jeffy coming at you today from the Lincoln Road Mall in Miami South Beach Florida for the wonderful rst Winter summit I'm here today with Madison the Canadian like the Canadian instructor and today we're gonna touch on the topic of blind spots in game and I think this is a hugely important topic you know we hear a lot about sticking points one thing you really don't hear about a lot about is blind spots what's the distinction between the two how can you discover what these are and most importantly how can you then take action to prevent these from plaguing you in the future so you want to start off on this yes sir I like that from Canada by the way it was black yeah so blind spots I just talked with Jeff I was saying blind spots are a lot like G spots they're hard to find right it's like hard to find do they exist is it a phenomenon that's real this is an old Miss Taylor right I don't know but blind spots actually do exist so I'm thinking what about blind spots is that they're so hard to find because you don't know that they're there obviously as the name implies right so in game as you're developing your you're getting an identity and becoming a guy it's good quote-unquote good with women successful as women in order to get that new identity you have to kind of like believe everything that is good believe your own shit kind of like I'm cool I look good my opener is amazing you believe this stuff so strong that while you're doing that and your form that new identity of believing in yourself at the same time on the opposite end of the spectrum you're sometimes missing stuff you're missing very very basic stuff that could just goes on notice and that's usually a blind spot and it's hard to figure it out because you can't see that it's there now everybody else will see that it's there the women can see that it's there your way me I can see us there but you have no idea that it's there and people will point it out to you but it's kind of hard to take that feedback to heart yeah it's really it's very glaring usually to everyone else and it's kind of interesting because you know I have a lot of friends believe it or not despite yeah despite my like caustic demeanor but you know I see a lot of my friends they have blind spots and these guys aren't even in pickup but for example I have one friend who consistently dates like horrible women like women that are just like Bad News Bears like get him sent to jail and shit and then he breaks up with them and then eight months later he's back with him like - are you fucking moron I have another friend who gets so drunk that he like pees in his pants I'm sorry but okay and I'm like dude he comes but he goes that I'm like dude you just piss yourself like he's like yes I'm like you need to stop trick he's like I know and then guess what next thing you know he's back at it again so but here's the here's the most like I guess compelling part of this whole thing when I see that stuff yeah it makes me mad you know and it frustrates me but on another level unlike more concerned about the blind spots that I am not aware of right so and again looking at these guys when I tell them over and over they stay they what do they do it they nod and smile they say yes I understand and then there's bright back to it because I think that having an eye you know and ident your identity even the disempowering aspects of it getting rid of those disempowering aspects since it is an integral part of your identity as it were it can seem like like a death right it can seem like a small part of you is dying because you'd like learn to associate with that yeah and that's what makes it so difficult to like root those things out it's like I've been this guy all my life this is what I know like I've been the nice guy the shy guy the agreeable guy the apologetic guy whatever it is you've been that guy all of your life that's all you know so for you to like now go against that it's kind of like unleashing or taking your hand off the steering wheel of everything you know in your life and your to be out of control and it scares you to death I can understand how you feel like that because I've I've been like that I've been in your shoes before I became an instructor before actually Jeff helped me become an instructor Iowa is a student of game for ten years dude ten years I think that's the longest anybody's ever been in like this regular pickup before hug instructor yep ten years ten years of sticking points ten years of blind-spot so I went through every single one like hands and knees like crawling in the dirt trying to figure out what they were and solved them and in terms of what I think they are so far I think there's two types of blind spots manually mainly okay as a man that slurring words here two types of blind spots the first is a technical one where it's like you just don't know what the technique is if you hear the technique you would apply it you would solve it you would you would handle that shit immediately that's of my favorite students like hey by the way you know you have to do not put the hand in lower back and he said oh sure okay eliminates it good fixer next one is I think it's an emotional kind of blind spot or an emotional sticking point yeah where it's like he knows the right answer he's watched 200 RSD videos you've watched the hardest under the arts and videos this week you watched them but you just can't get over it that's because you're having trouble letting go of the identity that you have already to build at this point you're comparing yourself to who you should be in the future who you've always been I should be this I haven't been that my friends are good at this I can't do this and all this internal turmoil creates this blind spot you came and see what the answer is I wish sometimes to be as easy as saying like talk louder until a guy talk louder then what is it I can't talk louder right it has this emotional sticking point when it comes to it so that's how they relate so you can usually a blind spot is kind of like a star dying like a supernova or some star dying right when the blind spots there you can't really tell it's there you can see the outward effects of it it has to reach a critical mass yeah so I typically for all this I bet somebody in the YouTube comments is gonna be like well actually I'm a scientist somebody's gonna do it before you fucking do that or to cut that shit off right now but this effects it reads like a tipping point you know where it's it gets to the level where you can't it can't be avoided anymore you know and I was talking to Tyler about this you know - you're you know we're actually a couple years ago now when I really decided to stop drinking when I was going out to game like it was like completely pointless I realized that but like right or stop smoking for that matter you know my voice got so bad really the it basically what happened was my boys got so bad from touring and going out and doing like a free tour on Thursday straight into boot camp working all day on Saturday and then into boot camp again literally I would fly out on Sunday not even able to tell the taxi where I wanted to go like he's like where do you go I'm like like it got to the point where I literally had to make like pantomime and airplane flying he's like okay Airport and took me there but again that was terrifying and because this our moneymaker you know if I lost the ability to speak that's I gotta find something else we've got to find a new gig right so it was only then that I really decided to start to get like dig into like the the root causes of that and stop and fucking stop it so I was talking to Tyler about this long story short and he's like yeah man I truly he's like yeah man he's like I truly believe that people do not make a change until they are forced to and most people won't stop like something like smoking mostly one will stop smoking until they got a fucking tracheotomy and trach tube in their neck story short people don't make that change until they reach some kind of like rock-bottom critical mass where there's no alternative what does that cause though what is that called emotional leverage yeah right yeah you absolutely need that because a lot of a boot camp I'll you have a student who comes on boot camp because all right I'm here to make a change I'm like really really you know you really here what's your wife so a guy come on boot camp right a student come on boot camp support we have where we can we take people out into the field and he's like I'm here because I want to make a change I want to make a change I'm tired of the way my life is my life sucks I want to make a change say what's up to Aussie by the way what a Baazi got a Aussie kvo the video there so he wants me could change but what happens in reality as you can oftentimes the guys that had the hardest times of bootcamp are the good student the classically good-looking guy who wants to get better or these guys this weekend and and it's like it's pretty crazy yeah it's exactly what you're talking about he's like I want to be better we had so many good results he doesn't have an emotional leverage to make the change on the flip side of that like completely inverse you have the guy who is stuck with woman his whole life's at the 22 year old fresh off the boat Asian guy learn how to play the violin at ten years old by his family with his family and for some reason he's so stuck in his identity that he doesn't feel he has the opportunity or even deserves to speak loud and bright and take up space as a human being and I'm trying to be like no it's okay divorce yourself from your story that's just who you've been before this is the new you you can be happy now right so those are those both those students haven't really had the most enough emotional leverage to overcome where they are right now and say this is gonna be it no more I've had it old me is dead say goodbye to the old me this is the new me and hold me he's dead and gone like the Justin Timberlake and Ti song right so yeah what are your thoughts on that I think it's it's pretty complex because even when you do arrive at that point where you decide to make that change it could be temporary because homeostasis is very powerful and your whole ecosystem your brain everything is going to conspire to try to revert you to that old way of being that might be disempowering or have disempowering aspects to it so it's important to understand that it's again it's kind of like physical fitness you know just go to the gym get jacked and then be like this is it I'm jacked now for the rest of my life yeah problem solved right so you have to understand it's an ongoing process and take pains to not only remove those kind of like anchors that might try to drag you back in that that disempowering stuff yeah you said about that because they're like oh I've made a change once so therefore I am permanently fixed this always happens to the first night of boot camp for me by the way soon it will come and I'll do social momentum so how to get one the club had a plan his night how to kind of just you know take the latest ride we could think of the night how to get into get into a good flow and then the second item poot camp I'm like alright so you guys know how to get warmed up let's go do this come meet me in 20 minutes by the bar or whatever and he'll go and just do nothing he'll stop doing approaches he'll revert back in his old self and I think that comes from ego dude that's just ego it's like most people can't quite figure out what their blind spot is or they can't solve it because their egos is too fucking big like no no no I got this no no I've done this before my other friends blah blah blah it's like a lot of ego and ego stops you from solving your blind spots the reason why I got I wouldn't say good fast but I lose I got as good as I got which is like you know being able to pull like a stunning girl for much every night I go out I have a full night to myself like a full you know what I'm not on bootcamp which is very rarely now these days but getting paid not to get laid you gotta get on a shit in during the week prior work what date of monday to wednesday cuz then Thursday or Wednesday is a travel day right and Sunday is recoup day what uh honestly I think money to Wednesday's like thee that's the professional secret yeah because you know and I've said this before you know if you go out in the weekend that's like an event you know it's an event they gathered the girls they spent an hour and a half preparing they pregame they go out together and they all intend to leave together and so it's kind of like a big thing you've got in like a Tuesday night and there's like two girls sitting at the bar much more likely that you know it's gonna be go time so you kind of make without make sense of all this what I'm saying it's blind spots we all have them we've all experienced them we don't know what they are until we till it's too late so we've had a left failures in our life that gives us emotional leverage to kind of get over them we could talk that we can take feedback from girls we open to feedback from girls and they help us identify it so for example if a girl walks off 20 times in a row when you open maybe you have bad right maybe you're not talking about enough maybe you're approaching from weird angle could be a million things but take that feedback from the girls be open to environmental feedback it also be open to feedback from your buddies their wingman some other cool guys at the bar but that one girl who's like listen sweetheart you're really nice but you need to take a shower or whatever it is that she says right into that and that's all gonna be also in my program coming out Madison bootcamp at home that's gonna be up a little bit because I wanted to get into that too because I think so far you know again it's kind of a ramp a little bit of a rambling video here but I think the essential main points are twofold number one listen to your fucking wings when they tell you shit be like you said be open to that like make a conscious effort to become open to criticism or you know constructive criticism from your friends of course you know people say well you know what I try to learn this stuff people give me a lot of shit for like trying to get out of my box you know the crabs in a bucket mentality and and yeah that's real but by the same token you need to understand those friends you have that have your that truly do have your best interests at heart people who are also engaged in this endeavor educate your wings as you said other sources like our ski instructors you know other instructors if you choose to go that route whatever I don't recommend that obviously but but but but still so that's number one being open to like listening and and taking shit to heart but then number two is understanding that it is an ongoing process it's not a one-and-done thing it's something that requires constant introspection and constant evaluation of where you're at putting yourself on the cross so to speak and making those changes if necessary on an ongoing basis so yeah as you mentioned you're coming out with this thing in August called the Madison boot camp at home and from what I understand from gabs from what you've told me about it is that it is going to be a product at number one will help you identify very clearly the sticking bullets you have without necessarily happy to outlay the resources the massive like expenditure that is a boot camp we know not everyone can afford that between like the cost of the program itself the airfare the lodging is a setter the time off from work so again it's something you can use at home to have an instructor assess your sticky points and then furthermore again from what I understand it'll give you various exercises to engage with on an ongoing basis that are gonna be able to really sub man that that's gonna be able to again fulfill that sharpening of the saw that again that that perpetual introspection and course correction that is required to have success long term so what I what I found out in my my years of teaching now my 10 years of game banging my head against the wall being the fucking master of the unnatural x' and not knowing yeah do it I grew the mats or the unnatural died I really like group in Canada in a place where I didn't speak the language I did was the hours of minority I had everything working against me so I had to like figure this out like tooth and nail like just detail by detail if you report by fewer probably charts excels charts breakdowns everything it's the color coding all that diagram yeah pie chart yep all that shit all that I did and so I pretty much spread sheet press reach and I pretty much know the answer through every single sticking point that you will ever face and every single blind spot you will ever have in your entire life I I don't even bullshit that on top of that I was trained by every single RSC instructor including Jeff and Tyler and so you have like a cubit of 100 years of information installed my brains when I give you an answer it's not like oh this is the answer eyes I'm just coming up with it looks like I'm saying it haphazardly just off the cuff but I've actually probably sat and cried many and many nights about that answer that's that's a big thing to man it's like people understand like no we're not you see me giving guys shit the reason I give it guys so much shit is because every dumb mistake that you could make I've made that dumb mistake and probably a 10 to a hundred times worse and more like extreme like a more like extreme version of that yeah so that's where it comes from you know again if you were to have seen myself Madison Tyler any these guys RC coaches ten years ago you would have no qualms or questions whatsoever that you can replicate anything that you see us do yep right so kind of um continued with Jeff saying here right you can go on the internet you could just find game there's tons a 2-bit to pick up teachers that are out there there's they're a dime a dozen to teach you pick up but they're not gonna be able to analyze and assess and break down a concept from ten different angles okay that's called dimensionalizing I'm not gonna be able to break down a concept mention Eliza yeah to break down four different dimensions right different angles so it clicks in your mind so you're getting a high quality coach a guy who cares about teaching I think teaching is a science in art I mean the fact what we do is we actually refined our teaching every single boot care that we do we explain something to a student we teach it to them and we see like if it works and if they don't get it and we were finding a little bit more and so we say one day and the student goes oh and then eyes kind of light up and again as you said it's not it's not really about the technique anymore we've got that nailed you know we got that shit dialed I think we figured it out after fucking fifteen years but now what it's really about and from the frustration of being instructor and seeing these guys like under as you said understand logically what they're doing incorrectly or could do differently to get a better result but they're just not executing right so again not only have we developed like the teaching techniques well now we're developing techniques to start to start to crack off crack off those years of social conditioning that are putting people in their head so they're not able to execute when they hit the street so when they hit the club so I really believe I truly believe this is the future of the the picth of the pickup instruction is going in this direction of starting to develop more and better ways to address those emotional blocks that are preventing you from you know go in an accident I think that's what this program is all about indeed so anyway highly encourage you to check it out I'm gonna be getting a log in the first day it comes out as well what a cool thing you'll get is get an assessment test with the program to go online multiple-choice test and actually assess what your sticking points is then we dive down to an example of kind of ethereal 'if of what the sink point is why it came about to be this way etc etc and then we have some infield demonstrations and coaching and then you have kind of finalized you have a finalized kind of two missions to go out and do yourself so you're actually getting a three-day boot camp experience at home and again it's we're guys that can't travel and meet with me in person I honestly don't know how long that will teach pickup for idea the idea of getting a cute little girl that travels around me or a nice little white to settle down is kind of more and more appealing more and more interesting to me I don't I can't code it every single city in the world EV guys were like come to this place in South America come to this place in the Middle East and I can't go to these places so if you want to work with me live in person this is the next best thing to working to me live in person if you can't see me in person okay and this program is not gonna be around forever so I highly encourage you guys on it when it is available and it's really it's a everything you've ever wanted in a program everything you can imagine yourself for real for real I took my series by teaching very seriously we're actually talking about before about how seriously we take our teaching we kind of like joke around you videos but I take it very very seriously this is my livelihood and my success is your success I pretty much have no success unless you guys have success I want to see you guys go from from the chump to the champion from rock bottom to fucking rock star okay so yeah thank you for having me on your channel dude no problems dude and see you again check it out URL below please like and subscribe and I'll see you next time on my fucking channel I only recently finger bros bootcamp finger bros  what Amanda just had sex just just fuck her in the bathroom okay bye no it's okay first approach of the night I'm here I'm fucking boot camp with you motherfuckers I going home right now  your brain is being a hijack and you don't even know it you're constantly distracted and you're wondering why when they ask you a question do you feel like your whole life is stagnating maybe at work you're not taking new responsibilities maybe you're not learning anymore just not progressing what's happening is you wish there was a woman at the center of your life and every day you wake up or she's not there it's kind of driving you insane because every time you see her on the street in the mall at school at work she just slipped through your fingers like sand and it's driving you absolutely mad cuz a little piece of your manhood is escaping is slipping away every single day I'm not just some guy off of youtube hands they call a pretty face I spent 10 years learning the stuff there's nobody in the world right now that's he just picked up that's gonna student as long as I have before teaching my struggling struggling for everything blood sweat and tears everybody see my like just to get one piece of information that's them right now let's just say I'm on the top go check the video is not a question it's a documented fact the facts of these girls I wish I could unfurl their faces so you can see what they look like so when guys come to me they've seen the international models from Fashion Week they've seen you know the Olympic athlete they've seen the doctors the lawyers and it's like they want a piece of high quality woman action in their life they don't want to go back to how they've been and they're scared to go for the future of how it could be they're stuck in the limbo of purgatory if you will and they out they want the new version of themselves transitioning from rock bottom all the way to rock star he says you know what I want that high quality the high status woman for myself they separately at a point in his life where he's just but great he's not gonna take it anymore he doesn't want to go back to who he's been in for in the past and he's scared to reach for the possibilities of who he could be in the future and it's driving him crazy so he comes to me for a bootcamp that's a typical program where I take a guy out to bars lounges nightclubs cafes in the city and I show them everything that I know I become his personal wingman and mentor I tell him what to say how to say it what to do and why most important I also demonstrate for them and I tweak him live in the moment all these behaviors and interaction I want to be the Vince Lombardi or fucking Phil Jackson of your dating life I teach everybody broke college students who live in their mama's basement all the way up jet-setting CEOs who have threesomes on their both all the weekends just for fun guys company Virg shai murdered getting their first kiss tonight elevate the body of the week at the soul food god they're just controlling well everybody's eating on the palm of our hand it feels so fucking good now I analyzed thousands of thousands of students I've had over the years take it all the best absolutely the best strength I've distilled that down to a street sign that's guaranteed to get you results now so what you're getting is my decade of experience top of that and 100 acuity of the years of all the other RC instructors that have also trained me I've literally cherry-pick the best of their programs and put it into mine so you're standing on the shoulders of fucking giant baby gonna get an 8 unfair sex life I'm talking with mind-blowing sex life I'm going to come to 24/7 personal game mentor forget day game forget night game I'm talking about changing your whole world baby which is blights game what you do with boot camp typically you got to come from a city so take time off of work and get a play get a hotel just to be you and may cost around $2,000 or so and a one-on-one is actually six thousand dollars but this my friend is a fraction of the cost this is a online version of that course you can do in the comfort of your home anytime you want 24 hours a day seven days a week you can watch it over and over again this is the Madison who gave at home the person like who kept experience Anytime Anywhere the mad we'll camp at home it's time to stop fucking around  [Music]",RclQIjl4foo
is what the cleanest cabover Vinny but he was listening to like Christian rock who's like I am son of the one true kiss out of like Nickelback or some shit it's pretty intense yo what's up this is Jeffy I'm coming at you today from Orlando Florida where I'm running a bootcamp in hot seat combination with my good friend owen AKA tyler real social dynamics calm when i came out here I was initially a little bit disturbed by the prospect considering how I'd never been here before and you know when you think of Florida you tend to think of you know stand your ground fucking George Zimmerman like it's it's it's the south you know I mean you're in the fucking south this is the place where George Bush got elected prior others stole the election depending on your viewpoint so you know coming in I was a little had a little trepidation and I thought it would be truly terrible but in reality it's actually not that bad and so that's a pleasant surprise and I think comes down back down to that old saying you know wherever you go there you are right so it's like what you make of the situation anyway a little digression there that's not really the topic of what I wanted to get into today what I want to talk about today is things that guys do to attempts to impress girls that girls actually find cringe-worthy okay that when you do it you doesn't impress them they're actually cringing inside of how fucking pathetic you are and I got the idea from this from a thread that I was browsing on reddit the other day where they asked just this question and you know a lot of the answers seem to come back to a lot of the same topics now I kind of want to recap that a little bit and give my own personal spin on those ideas from a professional viewpoint and one of the first ones that they said was like stating obvious things about her in like a stupid way and I see this one a lot like my favorite example of this would be when I I see a guy talking to a very tall girl okay and this actually happened to me the other night I this guy was I roll up this guy's talking to some tall girl it was obviously it was just picking her up and he's like wow you're really tall huh it's like like what's the next question you think gonna be what do you think the next question is going to be have you ever played basketball and so this guy's like said he's like you're really tall and I go I I kind of interject him like aw dude that's great that's a real good one man she's tall hey girl have you ever heard that one before you ever bet you never heard that one before have you let me ask you the next one how do you ever play basketball and she like says it as I'm saying it laughs laughs laughs the dudes fucking blown out I'm in right it's it's a bit funny because that's one that I always use all the time because you know I have a bit of a predilection for tall girls I wouldn't go so far as to call it a tall fetish but you know it's kind of like climbing a mountain you know you feel a real sense of achievement after having done so this is kind of very similar to that old tactic of satirizing what the chod is doing right so in other words like a lot of times just to some guy talking to the girl saying totally shit and what's the common choli line of inquiry that he'll say oh god hi you're pretty what's your name what do you do where do you live do you like it etc etc etc so what I would do and I still do too sometimes to this day is I'll actually roll up and I'll mock the guy by doing what he's doing in like a satirical and mocking tone like a black so you're pretty what do you do will you live what car do you drive what's your m where do you live oh haha did I already ask that one ha ha ha ha and of course what's the predictable reaction well the guy's fucking blown out the girl starts laughing so what does that say about you and you're able to do stuff like that well what it says is you have an intelligence about the social matrix you have an awareness of how the social matrix operates you're not just some idiot balai the Lee standing there saying shit thinking you're awesome so the next thing in this list of things that women said men do to try to impress them that actually make the cringe eternally was to say something along the lines of well you're really smart usually girls that look like you aren't right and you know the guy think that he's committed or some compliment and in actuality it's it's it's big it's pretty insulting if you think about it now this is in direct contrast to of course negs right and this then brings us to negs which is another thing on the list and the girls like when you do negs I could tell I could tell it from you know a mile away it's extremely obvious what you're doing it just makes you look like some socially retarded fucktard who gets advice on how to pick up women from internet forums that assume that we're dumb and easily manipulable well now that's interesting and of itself because if you think about it that shit doesn't actually work now granted sometimes manipulative tactics are quite effective however for the most part you know assuming that those kind of tactics work actually makes them the sexist okay because they're the ones that are swimming that you note at the sex was work on dumb and easily manipulable women but in any case I mean of course that's why in our SD we tend to focus on things such as cultivating humor core confidence etcetera to get the girls we want because we assume that they're generally pretty socially savvy however you guys have a huge point when it comes to like this using of the negs because look can they work sure but for the most part in this day and age they're fucking ridiculous they're fucking terrible okay why is that well if you think about it back in the heyday of you know pick up pu a's like popularity in the mainstream culture back in like we're talking about 2005 2006 when we had you know the vh1 show when we had you know the game come out and so on and so forth what did the cultural shorthand for pick up a comment like what well as far as the mainstream concern what was pick up because look any cultural phenomenon i passes through our society is probably goes pretty deep if you look into it but as far as the people just getting their news like hearing about other fucking Facebook feed or whatever the only pick one or two things and that's what they'll remember that will define the movement itself and of course with pick up one of those two things become well it was negs and peacocking can they work absolutely they they're fundamental things for a reason however you know in this day and age like I said it's kind of become the new what's your sign right I mean it's like this jokey ridiculous thing so basically how what are the circumstances that it could work well for example if you do have really subtle and it's somehow contextual okay um for example the other night I was on a date with some girl and I found out that she had a really cool car right turned out she had a really cool car and I was like wow I would have thought you had a sensible computer car surprised of cars that cool right and it was you know it's not hilarious but it's like you know a big name using its in the context of the conversation it's kind of like a playful little little tease at her and so so that was that was good that worked okay so to speak on the other end of the spectrum you then have shit like Julian where he's saying like are you fat I want to berate a fat cunt like you know it I was joked that you know if you remember back in like 2007 2006 2007 the comedian Paul Rudd did a YouTube short basically satirizing pickup and mystery and he said the guy was called an alias and this guy goes to like take a boot camp from alias and in the boot camp basically alias just goes with the girls like I love your hair looks silky shit was that real fucking horse hair fucking weave you're a fat cunt right and then the girls are all over him well it's funny because that was a satire back then but now this is what Julian actually does okay so unless you're some advanced guy that can pull off the calibration needed to make that work or if you're just very astute at rolling with things in the moment and like making shit up like that you know they can work but generally in this day and age negative girl is going to be shit so this brings us to the next one and this is the sending of dick pics okay and of course what I mean is texting the girl or emailing the girl a photograph of your penis and the hopes that she's going to see this somehow become just magically turned on and it just like be like yes this is the man for me this is the guy for me this dick aw whoo yeah I mean look to be honest if a girl sent me like some picture of her like spread out twat finger-banging yourself like I probably would find that a little gross I mean that's just me I have a friend who loves that shit but again that's like that's from a guy's perspective an unsolicited dick pic it's just just fucking ridiculous okay it's it's not cool it's not funny it's fucking gross okay and even if it was solicited I probably wouldn't send it regardless okay why next thing you know there's gonna be a fucking video like it's gonna be posted up on the fucking dirty or whatever it's gonna be like look pickup artist to Jeff Allen sent me a photograph of his dick to probably like set it to Nickelback or some shit and it'll be like the new nickel backing video like they did with mystery right okay nickel backing right like a nickel backing that's pretty good Jeff so again dick pics out of the question don't fucking don't fucking send it the only way I could see that somebody would get quotable get away with making this work would be if they were just incredibly congruent with being that kind of guy like for example if if man whore does it I could you know it could put it could conceivably work because from the moment begun interacting with her he said of extremely like sexual frame with the girl okay so dick pics are not good fucking cringe now the next one and this was by far the most cited one on the entire thread was trying to impress by either flaunting wealth by talking about how cool your car is by talking about how much you can lift in the gym by talking about how many girls you fucked this kind of shit I mean absolutely absolutely fucking fucking terrible and this goes back to a very central tenet of the entire pickup seduction community which is never qualifying yourself okay look man any sort of bragging whatsoever is is going to be it's going to sub communicate neediness which of course is perhaps the most unattractive characteristic of all the most unattractive personnel quirk of all is neediness so so much the extent that if I even can't like even if the girl like asks me about shit I will like downplay it okay the only time that you can like like income I catch a whiff with me like saying anything I could even come across as qualify myself for bragging I will downplay the fuck out of it now of course if the girl asks me about it then I will sort of like sheepishly cop to it so to speak right however for the most part I just get you to downplay it or sweep it under the carpet or not discuss it at all now there are a couple of exceptions to this this rule and one of those of you again if she if she asked you about it the second would be if you're genuinely passionate about it okay you don't want to talk about how like good you are at shit it's much much better to talk about how much you enjoy certain things for example I remember back and say like 2007 you know when I had really started to kind of like maybe 2005-2006 but I really started to get serious about like hitting the gym and all that kind of stuff I would go out I would like talk to people about it and it wouldn't come across as like qualifying yourself why because it was like I was new to it I was like super stoked about it and as such it wasn't like I wasn't bragging but I was just like yeah doing all the stuff it's so great I feel great about it like da-da-da-da-da and that kind of attitude was actually infectious do you understand when it's not coming from a place of trying to impress someone and that's what I get one of the key tenets of game especially when I'm talking to students on bootcamp I'll tell them look when you go in there I want you to really tonight I want you to feel in your body I want you to think about where your words are coming from it and you get a moment are they coming from a the place of oh I hope they stay and keep talking to me are they coming from be the place of genuine amusement genuine enjoyment and self-amusement okay any time it's the former I tell them cut that shit off and begin talking about stuff that you enjoy another thing that they mentioned was lying about being into the same things that she's into right so if she's like oh you know I really loved the movie or I really loved the Fifty Shades of Grey books dick oh yes I love the Fifty Shades of Grey books as well I just thought it was amazing that the the sadomasochistic interplay and the dynamics I was just so in captivating and fascinating look man I read that shaded fucking sucked okay I'm not gonna pretend to be into something in some like convoluted ploy to make her think that we have so much in common I also see this shit a lot on on the internet like I got internet like approach or their online game you know what they'll do is though peruse the girls profile and cherry pick one or two things and be like I love this too as though the girl is gonna be like oh oh this guy loves fucking uh I don't know what some crappy band this guy loves X crappy band that I love fuck yeah let's let him put his dick inside me like fuckin fascinating right um by the way another shit thing that I notice online guys tend to do online and this kind of relates almost back to the dick pics thing is they will because some girl did mention this they'll often take photographs of them with like girls right like yeah me with hot girls at the club or me with hot girls around my arm thinking that what's I mean what's the extensible lot here they're gonna be like the girls can be like Oh social proof girls like him he's fucking cool when in reality it's extremely transparent what you're trying to do like it's very very fucking transparent it's not cool it's fucking wack and in this kind of um this brings back to another thing they mentioned kind of in line with almost the dik-diks thing like sometimes this girl said summers guys will be like showing her a picture like on their phone and as they're like going through there's just like tons of nudes of other girls on it it's like come on dude clean your fucking shit up you know I mean she's not gonna be like jelly because you're such a boss player you fuck all these other girls at the at best she's gotta think you're sloppy and moronic at worst she's going to thank again you're trying to front that you're like some big kind of player motherfucker and either of those is not good another one that they mentioned was like when you first meet the girl constantly telling her how beautiful and sexy she is like damn girl you sexy want to hang out damn you're very beautiful girl you want to hang out now of course as you know pickup artists or guys studying seduction were usually actively trained to avoid this kind of stuff but this is stuff that you see a lot of the times in in civilians laymen you know guys doing cat calls on the street to girls saying shit like like if girls walking down the street there's a huge complaint I hear from my female friends they're walking down the street and then some guys like put a smile on that face honey a girl's pretty as you needs to smile it's like fuck you I don't want to smile bitch you fucking smile you know what I mean like if some Cadoo said that to you would you you know even if a girl said it to you and you're like walking around some pissed-off mood sort of a fuck herself another one that came up a lot was the whole but I'm a nice guy act right like girls you know I'm just I just can't find a girl because I'm just such a nice guy and girls don't want nice guys right look motherfucker if you were really a nice guy you wouldn't need to tell her about it I'm a nice guy you know if I'm like with a girl that I like I'm like a very nice guy I'm a very nice and sweet guy despite my little internet persona but I don't need to go around like flaunting it much in the same way that the rich guy doesn't need to tell you he's rich and along those same lines you know with the nice guy shit oftentimes guys will say you know women are just like women just don't want a nice guy like in just a general talking shit on women in general sometimes like I said before talking shit about your ex or talking shit about women in general that is not going to gain you any any points with the girl if I can impress the girl and lastly one that they talked about was like just talking about yourself too much like just incessantly talking about yourself even not in a bragging way it's like constantly talking oh I did this I did that I went here today I saw this that I did that telling stories just about yourself now this is a huge one for me and I find myself falling into this quite a bit even to this day because why because I'm so goddamn awesome right and I but I just I'm just like infatuated with the sound of my own voice so I have a tendency like especially if I'm on like a date or something to just touch a cha-cha cha-cha cha-cha and you'll see it happen you'll see you'd like it of shifting like the weight of the conversational ratio shifting way too much in your favor and then you get to the point where you pause and it's time for her to say something she almost can't even respond because she's like shut down by this bharat there's like deluge of information just been spewing out over the last several minutes okay so those are all that's like a laundry list there of things that guys do that actually do not impress the girls that they think fucking suck now to recap let me kind of just go through these once more so number one she brings up a topic that she knows about don't try to outsmart her on it okay number two you are not your car you are not your guitar you are not your paycheck you are not your deadlift okay number three if you know nothing about the topic you're talking about let her know ask her about it and actually appear interested okay this goes back to that old David Dee aphorism be interested and interesting be interested in her and interesting another thing you're not a gorilla quit beating your chest having a dick size competition with every other guy out there and then this a big one women talking shit about other women is fine but you cannot talk shit about other women in fact you know what scratch that that whole shit you shouldn't be talking shit about anybody that's just an unattractive quality in general do you understand I mean for example one thing that really inspired me was to see Owens reaction when the game came when the book the game came out and portrayed him as this again like this mutant genetically inferior troll who's also a sociopathic like manipulator right so a lot of people like how are you gonna retaliate like how are you gonna get back at him if you were around in that era you would notice that one thing that Owen never did was talk shit about Neil you never talk sh about me never talk shit about mr. e he never talks shit about Neil in fact that's a big part of our SDS corporate culture we don't talk shit about other people and I try not to talk shit about other people in my own life in general unless I know them very well it's like my friend I can talk shit about my friend right you know cuz I know him I know him like that you know but if it's like some random person in the media that's getting like excoriated or something I'm like very loath to step in and weigh in on that shit like fucking Justin Bieber deport him but as just a broader life philosophy when am I going to talk shit about somebody else I'm gonna fuck shit about somebody else when there's nothing to talk shit about myself okay when I run the perfect boot camp when I've put together the perfect hot seat when we've got like our company like at the perfect vision of where we want it to be when I've got my own mental physical and social-emotional issues sorted out that's that's what I'll take you know a moment to kick back put my feet up on the desk and start talking shit about other people but I tell that day comes I'm just gonna keep my fucking mouth shut okay and again I think that that is many ways are very attractive quality to people and they see that you know you take out your own house before you start talking shit about others so having some of that I'm going to sign off here a lot of food for thought here I know that probably a lot for a lot of guys watching this this is simply preaching to the choir but for a lot of the novice guys check yourself and see if you're actually engaging in these kind of behaviors and doing these things around women and if so do your best to eradicate them from your life this has been Jeffy here in Orlando Florida and I'll see you next time completion completion completion completion,RmY-urBDwZA

what's up it's Owen and Jaffe and we're going to be doing right now is shooting into a series of videos on what to me and Jeff is the triumvirate of game as far as being expansive energy and charisma and the ability to make a massive massive social impact so these three pillars are vocal use storytelling ed humor and what this allows you to do is to walk into any situation that you want to be in and really captivate people whether that's you in front of hundreds of people and just kind of ripping off the dome and really engaging people or whether it's trying to get a loan in a bank or whether it's trying to make friends some cool new person who normally wouldn't talk to you or whether or not it's really to get you know in a first tickets from an airport or of course if you meet a nice lovely lady in the night and she's mixed up in a big group of dudes and other people because she's a really high-level girl she's not just in there by herself and you want to kind of work your way in you want to captivate that whole group we get them looking at you gets him giving you attention and make her divert to you so that you're the one taking her home so the people that she came to that venue with if you want to do that and by the way if you don't I don't even know why watching this because that's what we're all about okay having a massive massive fucking superpowers if you'd like to be able to do that what we're going to be teaching is how game relates with vocal use storytelling and humor jeff has been going out non-stop since 2003 I've been going out non-stop maybe four to seven nights a week four hours a night oftentimes this is you know different phases in my life can be different amounts but a lot of the time ever since 2002 we're recording this of 2017 so we've been doing this for years and years and there's a lot of calibration and subtle skill set building that's gone into this to be able to produce these kind of results but look here's the thing you don't need to go out for 15 years to learn this because we did it for you okay it's like no need to deal crack hope did that so hopefully you don't have to do that and what we're going to do right now is show you the skill sets that we've learned so you can actually have that really really crazy experience and then from there you're going to go out and internalize this and you're just going to fuck and crush it and get the same kind of results because we're going to actually cut your learning curve and it's going to be amazing what I want to do right now is launching this video by getting you to think about what is the real practical rubber meets the road payoff to setting our CD and it's so broad of everything from interchange to transformations to increasing your paradigms to improving your dating life to taking those same principles and applying them to life in general but as far as a really obvious shift that I feel day to day or moment to moment what I really experience is it out with my friends and the way that I'm speaking is me joking around telling stories and projecting my energy outward and it's cause not affect being of the comude mission statement always desmond it's like are you simply out there reacting to stimuli happen to you in a getting reactive way where it's just happening and you're in response to it constantly you're on the back to it or are you able to be at the cause of things in your environment proactively making decisions proactively expanding your energy onto the environment as opposed to again trying to kind of protect the little me I would 100% agree that and so on what I would say is how does your life look different like getting away from the more ephemeral stuff which is actually lot of my favorite stuff but just getting into a practical standpoint to me when I think eyes that are crushing it in this what I see guys are out kind of laughing having fun sharing stories sharing good energy and the girls are just perking up you're seeing you know the girls are looking coming Vinnie chase and Entourage where people are looking at the person like a celebrity and this should be happening when you're going into restaurants or into the bank or wherever it is wherever the girls that you want to meet and the beauty of it is that a lot of it can be really really effortless but fundamentally in my opinion it comes down to three practical outer skills which is voice storytelling and humor and when you have these down this is going to change your life in so many ways because the thing that I love about it is when the guy comes up to me he says dude I got a free first class upgrade because of what you guys teach I got I got it I got a cheaper rate on my mortgage I got into a better school job yeah better job promotion got let into a better place you know I was better at you know doing some kind of pitch to somebody that made me a whole bunch of money my life has just improved I'm at the cause not the effect so what are the skills that really translate as far as being able to do that and again it's really an upward spiral because the more that you have these skills down the more fun that you have and the more that you want to use them so what we're going to be doing right now is breaking into a lot of information and secrets and really just like hard-earned battle strategies for your life which Jeff is covering in a new program that is coming out with and we're going to do an overview right now a voice storytelling and humor and show you the reason why these are so important and how each one kind of functions that's changing your life this is something I've actually been thinking about for the past couple of years now because I think after 14 years it's fair to say that we've pretty much got the techniques stuff dialed right we've pretty much figured out the techniques the nuts-and-bolts mechanics of pickup artistry of game as it were to the to the degree where if anyone gives you a you know a hypothetical situation we can say well you can do this you can do this you can do this and we can give them different strategies we give them different tactics but what I started to see I'm sure you saw this as well in the past you know over the past dozen years or so is that we can tell a student what to do and he can even repeat what we're saying he can even duplicate what we're doing verbatim but the girls just aren't responding to it the same way that they do to us so I was like we need to go deeper because obviously it's not just about tactics not just about technique there's some sort of hidden harmonics or resonance if you will that happens between us and the girls that's simply not happening with a student who is doing the exact same things were doing verbatim so I want to kind of to dig in and figure out what was the secret sauce to that and it was almost simpler than I thought it was going to be and what I've kind of sucked out it's like like you said three things looks like a pyramid and the foundation is your vocal projection now we kind of take this for granted I think you know actually we don't because we all lose our voice every every week and so in fact we're keenly aware of it but then that's when we start speaking to hundreds of people about a microphone yeah yeah you know and we're doing this week in and week out at all these live events and so we're really putting a beat-down on our voices on a consistent basis but still at the same time it's almost like we've been lifting these heavy weights for the past 10 years 10 12 years doing these events so when we do go into a pickup environment or we do go into a business meeting where we do even just a large table amongst friends at a dinner we're able to just cut through and to the point where we're not even necessarily like yelling but the voice it just snaps people to attention right it just snaps people to attention and I think that's like one of the things that you see with a lot of new guys on your students on bootcamp they can't even get the girls to look at them yeah this is my game we're just because when I'm in say a restaurant my only goal is to get near the girls I want to talk to you and then I want her to hear my voice I want her to hear specific inflections and the way that it's projecting and the way that I'm not thinking too much about what other people think of it and if she can overhear it she's going to start perking up then if she perks up I'm going to expand my energy out in her direction or I might tell stories in front of her or tell jokes in front of her and then if she's seeing that then she wants to be part of it but really that's what it takes is you just get near them and then if you're doing that you're going to see a lot of responses you don't always even need to walk right up on a girl bag bang bang bang bang a lot of times they'll just open you by virtue like in this happened this happened to me literally the other night I was I was going to say anything coherent with her I was just yelling oi oi oi oi in in the club by like a some sort of drunken Australian oh I oh I had these two girls next was like III because they want to join in they want to be in the warm end of the pool so to speak and it's just again the tonality of the boys just there's something very pleasing about it to them almost and I was just like good evening my name is vampire vampire Potter and I pulled heard the ban and it was actually number 100 in the van so don't think I missed isn't yeah I do but that was a that just happened to be the other day and you know I'll frequently get opened simply by virtue of people overhearing this because again they want to be part of that energy because it says a lot of things about you people are making value judgments about you the second you open your mouth and they can hear the tone which is it pinched is it stifled or is it just like a nice home like a nice meting about but cutting piercing just Pleasant tonality and I think that we do that almost subconsciously we've trained ourselves subconsciously over many years to just naturally arrive at that like streetfighters you know what I would like the Kimbo Slice a voice but that I wanted to go and did some training for maybe like you know the the George st. Pierre of voice right somebody who's very or the Anderson Silva voice and was very technical and who knows professionally who's been actually investigating this tickler area so that was kind of the impetus for this program and then going deeper I just learned so much and to get that that resonance with other people where it just kind of snaps to and where you don't even really have to do much of anything you can pretty much you can act pretty normal and just like still an attraction fairly easily I think again the voice of the foundation and then the second thing is being able to speak in a compelling manner okay what we call storytelling you know how to relay information in a way that's not just this is like bland recitation this bland sort of interaction and then finally kind of putting the putting the secret sauce on it which is adding in the element of humor so if you stack those three up you really don't even need much in the way of technique but if you already have technique damn that it's like it's almost like cheating yeah that's and I've said that many times the past I'm sure you've dealt this way too like sometimes I'll call you up I'm like dude I'm killing it so hard right now it feels like it feels like cheating it's like scary it's almost scary you know you know what scares me by the way hmm seeing guys who don't have this down it honestly scared of me like if I see a guy who's trying to learn this and he's turn around talk to women and he's like hello how yes I would like to learn the game this shit pisses me off and sickens me to the point that half my videos this point is me calling guys up to the front of the crowd yeah to have them work on this put yourself in Jeff's shoes put yourself in my shoes so you spend 15 years leading to the body of knowledge beyond you sacrifice so much to leave this body of knowledge behind you you you taken like you know media beatings you've gone out with like weird hidden cameras you shot all over the world you dug deep to get this information and then you see a guy come into the class and he wants to learn it and you know that he's watching hours of videos yeah and it you you you're like dude if you're gonna watch hours of my videos I want you to have an awesome outcome I want your life to be changed I want you to have the sex life work life happiness of everything you want if I can do this for you then we did this so you could change okay what about my deathbed knowing that you get this is what will pacify he knowing I'm going to die and then they just burnt and they're like what is the technique to steal girl from what I know no why why right I'm like I'm not telling you I'm not telling you the aunt you know and they're like why won't you tell them because it won't work nothing I teach you could work until you fix this this is fake this isn't even you this is this weird fucking persona that you created to hide yourself to not reveal yourself it's fake it's a lie it's just connected just stop stop the carnage just stop stop stop now please and they're like but what's his game and so what's right I'm like no get up to the front get up here now scream and they're like uh yeah and I'm like audience is that the loudest they can go and they're all like all proud they're like like that nod is like no and then they're always like well if they legitimately think it's a lot of Stingo and I see the same thing on bootcamp they come in and you know we're doing a pre-brief stuff ok tell me a little bit about yourself what's your name where you from what do you do and I'm like hey can you speak up a little bit I go okay my name is like any legit he legit thinks he's speaking loud it frustrates me for the same reasons that you're alluding to which is like dude it's the same as if you had come to the bootcamp smelling like shit if you say and you had bad breath it's like you're willing to fork out all these resources to attend this you know this program but you can't even take getting brush your teeth come on dude and then it's blocking like we're gonna be up with you till late at night giving everything everything okay pieces of our fucking soul and then but like it couldn't get the Trident you couldn't brush it so it doesn't matter what what we give because it's not fixed it so the vocal thing it doesn't mean dream on a rant like I'm doing I'm just going to try to show different funny emotional techniques but it's it's from love and caring when you love some it's like your child and you love your kids so much you wanted to pass math so what he's ordered he gets a paycheck he knows how to calculate the hours you know times his wage to know if he's getting paid Jeff and I love you so much we care about you so much you must get this down you have to have sex with the weather you want you need to get the perks of learning social dynamics but if you're good and walk around that nothing we can show you can help and in fact this legacy of videos that we've created for you if anything is just putting you further in your head and then you're going out talking like this and then you're thinking which video did I do wrong it's none of the videos it's none it's none that's why we brought you to the front in every video well these are often the same guys who are the ones who have obsessively watched every video that I've seen every video that you've ever made I can tell you what you had for lunch on April 14 2012 and I go wow I don't remember that incident but you know and they literally have seen everything but they know it intellectually but it's not going to help as we're at the pre-written like if I can't hear you in a quiet hotel lobby how the fuck are these girls going to hear you in like a loud nightclub or bar look at you look at me are we physically different I am is my lung capacity somehow superior to yours do I was i gifted with a with an amazing set of vocal cords that are like the golden wings of Zeus or some shit or Pegasus no we have the same physiology but what's going on I mean you're probably shorter yeah we're probably a bit shorter than a shorter I'm bald oh yeah for Jagger the ability to produce the loud sound is there but again what's stopping it number one there's those inter game uses than the outer game issues they don't know how to produce the noise if I come in to bootcamp without brushing your teeth like they might say well fixing my voice that's not the same as brushing my teeth it's not that easy is it well actually it kinda is it really kinda is and so I'd assemble for this thing that's series of exercises I worked with a professional boys coach who's been doing it for 40 years and it really opened my eyes so like a lot of the stuff that I was doing incorrectly the and a lot of the stuff I was doing a lot of the stuff I arrived out of my my own accord and it was interesting to see how that my mental maps of how voice worked matched up with what like oh yeah I was right and then it was also interesting to see how I'm like well I think this out works and it was totally off-base so the vocal part of the program is centered on the series of exercises that are very simple to engage with so I mean I found very corny but it almost is like a magic pill when it comes to fix this voice shit it almost is because it's very very simple the neural pathways are already there like the myelin sheathing of how to speak it's already there because you've likely been doing it since you were you know three years old right you've been vocalizing ever since you came out of the room screaming right right so those neural pathways are there it's about reinforcing the good habits and letting the bad habits fall you know fall to the wayside and go fallow that's what I want to take your program to by the way because to me like I know how to build my voice over like six seven other people no mic but at the same time my voice will wear down I've been shooting videos all weekend my boy seemed a bit worn down today so long-term for me I know how to get the result but for sustained vocal projection I should definitely work on technique so I'm really excited to see what you're teaching and then in addition to that this is something where again it really comes down to expansive energy to where you want you to really think about the cycles here okay so you don't know how to use vocal you don't know how to tell stories you don't know humor so now the sudden you're walking up to girls and you're getting shut down so you're getting side down by girls which then puts you in your head now what happens immediately when you're being shut down and put in your head your voice actually gets worse your your storytelling becomes less charismatic cuz you don't expect to be heard and your humor goes to shit that's actually why by the way why does voice and storytelling and humor actually show status why does it allow a short guy a ball guy or you it to to be able to get the same girls that the athlete yet or the really attractive guy could get in fact why does it give you a huge leg up even in an environment where there's some famous athlete and you you've got a decent crack at it which I've been in these situations many times here in LA and I've never felt outgunned I've never felt outclassed in any particular situation doesn't mean I get every girl by and if any means or did that athlete doesn't go home with the girl but your personal feelings towards a Mike weren't polluted yeah before the approach because that thing like and and by the way the majority of the time I feel that that quiet famous athlete has less shot than us when we have the shiny object right then in there because the girl is going with feelings so already I'm not feeling outclassed but it's not just feelings also results well that's what it's allowing you to do is allowing you to play at that level when certain people are talking there's no I don't think game is good it's like dude what the fuck what the fucking fuck you don't you don't have current you couldn't charisma you're out of a fucking paper that is so funny too because when I see you do to set these free tours and these events we're like we're raiding the guy you're like stand up it started that you bring them all right that's it bring it up I'm like oh here we go again and it's almost become a cliche at this point like how there's almost well it is a cliche yes Oh Tyler's going to brace the guy fucking guys but don't want me to bring the guy up are the ones that can't get it but it's funny because they think I think a lot of times people get the impression that you're doing this out of some you know perverse you're getting some perverse joy out of it I am out of dwell fucking late yeah that perverse joy but I think you just like beating them up or something but it's like no motherfucker we're here to help you that's our entire reason for having rented this venue and this space and schlepping our asses down here to get up on stage and parade around for you right it's to get you result and your you ain't go getting all result talking like that I'll tell you that much or or even let's even get out because by us even imitating like that there's a lot of people that are in the mid-range they're going to say oh that's not even that bad yeah it's not even out of that but even if you're in that mid-range in what fucking world are you going up to these SuperDuper hot girls and thinking that you can be this ho-hum pedestrian motherfucker and these girls are going to ditch that fucking awesome dude you come and suck your dick when you have nothing fucking going for you not what because you're an aesthetic soul shut the fuck up you have to make a decision to play you've got to make a choice and say am i playing this shit or not like your new business right don't be taking out a loan from the fucking bank and then setting up some bullshit fucking marketing piece some bullshit products but shits going to say it's not going to work I don't care how much self-love you have I don't care what fucking that your mom thinks you're great you're going to lose the loan and your fuck you care well then in the same way look turn on a fucking iPhone or droid go up to a girl and I phone yourself then look at the infield footage the piles of it you see online we've gone to great lengths to get for you and look at a comparison go do a bit of public speaking engage the people see what you look like being realistic in assessing yourself but doesn't mean not to love yourself look great projection and storytelling and humor is based on a foundation of unconditional self-acceptance we get that it comes from presence it emerges from presence but it's also a decision to engage so that doesn't look I'm playing a slutty cartoon character I just fucking with you a little bit I'm trying to you got a lot of that to use attention I'm trying to show you how to try to get your attention to go like this right so we can we can go dice happy tender whatever it is but at the end of the day me and Jeff can't care more about your results than you do we can't care more than you do and the question is do we do we how do you think it makes an instructor feel to see somebody who truly wants to improve not making a decision to engage it's tough it's like if you're a physical trainer and you're sitting there you're like here's your different dietary intake here's what you're going to do here's your cardio here's your weights but then the guy chooses to just eat macaroni and not let the weights and it's like what you want it or not so at a certain point you've got to make a decision if they look I'm going to have expansive energy because I know it works so you say okay how am I going to use my voice how am I going to engage with emotions coming from my voice okay Daan's holding attention storytelling how does it flow how does it ride what makes it compelling what makes it actually connect with them what how can you notice when it's time to get to the end of the story aware it's time to let it let it ride a little bit more and like I kind of ride the wave of people enjoying it there's a lot of stuff at play here but again even if you're a person who already is fairly good at storytelling in like small groups it's like when you get out to these clubs it's a whole different matter and at that point it's like say you're a music producer or something you make this awesome song right you write this awesome song and then you're trying to play it on some little shitty Bluetooth speaker like it's not it's not going to have the same impact it's like a pyramid right the voice is the foundation that we have the actual storytelling and then we just sprinkle on like that little extra bit of humor to kind of fucking just give it that like salt that salt Bay shit you know because that's one of the things I hear a lot like people are like you know when I see comments on my videos like wow there's I don't know Jeff you're you really good at storytelling you're really good at relying you know I'm using little anecdotes and things of that nature and of course I've also heard that my voices so I was like you know where my strengths what can i what I do and you know I'm a bit of a perfectionist so originally I was like this is just going to be a voice program you know let's do a quick you boys bug but down like well this also kind of ties in with the two so we better add some of us had then and then it just kind of spiraled out of control but oh you're like okay this shit is what gives a guy a fighting chance it's something where if you have no resources you weren't warned of good looks you don't have a bunch of money this is something that you can use to level the playing field right so when I go to say like what I like say back in them 2010 for example 2009 even I go and say different entrepreneur innovations well there's people there that are that have businesses that are doing 50 times the amount of sales or hundreds of times a thousand of the times more than what we're doing right so how do you get that person to give you respect how do you get them to want to converse with you you get in there you start shit expansive energy storytelling jokes and now that guy writing that billion-dollar company is like who's that guy and now he wants to get in the group the best part is - and you got this down the best shit is one then you even ignore a little bit you know right so that guy now he's hovering around you and everybody is used to that guy getting the attention because of the money like he's got the money but then you're sitting there and you don't give a fuck it doesn't you're ignoring him to be a dick but you're just kind of doing what you're doing and now he's trying to get your attention and then that just do pro can I trade numbers and then you wake up the next day and that dude who everybody else is trying to become friends with it's hitting you you know that reminds me of Nick yeah like the are one of our wonderful co-founder that guy he just meets all kinds of crazy people from all walks of life and like how do you meet this guy's like well I was in a bar and I sort of a conversation with him because he had a salad and it was after a closing time and I got him a set like he had some like crit because that nick has a very booming voice you know he's like that's one thing about him he's not like necessarily the funniest guy in the world he can't me he can be more unintentionally yeah unintentionally a lot of the time but he can't spin a yarn you know he can't he does not tell a compelling story and his voice is like very fucking loud I'm not interested in making hits I want to make a classic something will stand the test of time and you know I realize I thought about a bit about him like what's like my shtick like what am i known for voice humor and storytelling so I'm like fuck it there it is right on the table let's do it those are the things that give energetic control right because when you walk into an environment when you have energetic control you're seeing these different people in the environment and you're either the cause of the effect so if you understand how to use your voice in it like my voice is actually run down Gavin I've been shooting almost morning so night for like a week now so that's why I need to actually learn you have this ice you have this permanent state of mild laryngitis I can't yeah because I mean I just record tici tici tremor on business so that's I want to actually take your course it looks gross too because when I was taking mister she showed me photographs of like what these like diseased vocal cords look like Christ gross well that's nice to know yeah you'll be like it's like it's like we're like a smoker like look at a picture like some disease something like oh so that's what I'm doing on Sunday that's what my voice might look like on Sundays see I got my voice to the point where just the sheer amount that I talk any normal person would be a lot more beat up so it's not right oh you were anything like that but for me that's why one learn more about the techniques that you have for longevity but as far as the immediacy and what I've enjoyed for the past 15 years it's that ability to walk into an environment and you're seeing guys girls who ever try and talk to and whoever you're trying to influence and knowing how to like a magician or wizard it's like a superpower and here's the great thing anyone can learn it like literally anyone can learn to improve this because because the story right as a guy does it right he starts off he sucks then he just works on it works on it and what's he gonna see he's gonna see people more hooked a little bit but as he does it he's gonna let off the gas right because you do it for a little bit you like whoo-hoo-hoo it's working right they learn how to fly you know and then you're like you're 10 feet off the air notes fuck if you fall down right but then as you learn how to hold it like that to the point that I mean you in seminars we're just fucking regaling the audience and you can kind of you can hold it and here's the best part is when you can hold the tension there and it's so crazy because say you've got women around you or whoever right whatever it is and you're holding that tension there toward the energy is on you because you're the source of good emotions and you are the fixation and central point of attention and then at that point that's when you can go no no no no no right you know if you tried doing that to a girl who's not glued on you good luck right like you can't walk up remember no don't talk she's like all right later like I said but we have that focus on you that gives you the ability to even push away then she chases then she invests and so it's you know and then you can take that investment now the girls on you and you hit another girl on you you're seeing the fabric of the conversation okay I guess back you know if this is like the early 2000s we'd say like you're seeing the matrix right when the matrix is popular but that's really how it feels like because there is like an underlying physics if you will to conversation and to engaging people and to telling stories in a compelling way if you look at again a master as a stand-up comedy these guys those guys are true masters of stuff where they can they can literally feel the energy in the audience shifting so they know just when to let it out they don't just when to get a little more intense to like draw them in they know just when to take it to a high point all that stuff it's like learning a new language you know you'll start you'll start to see the basics okay the basic setting structures and stuff like that you start see the grammar of charisma and once you understand that it gives you a lot more leeway to just play with it and again it almost feels like you've got kind of like she's got him eating out of the palm of your hands you know and this is why and like I said it all starts from the voice so this is why often wouldn't and I'm sure you see this all the time you know we go up in the club and I have to kind of do is just be like good evening and they're like who the fuck is this and they know there's something different about this guy he's not like these like defensive little guys running around hoping it works trying to protect a little ego this has expansive in a way that is unusual and I think that the reason people are drawn to that is because they're like if I were to hang around with this person maybe I could learn how to feel that way too you know what I mean because even just hanging around with you they'll get look at a whiff of that it'll kind of wear off on them just being around you and I think that's why again a lot of girls uh continue to see me despite some of my less desirable characteristics you know the fact that I'm in some weird pick up wizard cult but you know or what or what have you is just because again the emotions they get from being around me and that all comes from but that can I again I know how to use my boys I know how to tell stories and I know and I'm humorous to an extent you're the cause not the effect of the emotions yeah then they can lay back and experience and yeah and be brought into a world it's like they're going on a ride you know you're taking them on a journey you're taking them on like a rollercoaster ride you know every time that they hang out with you every time you interact with them it's like who the fuck would want to be around that you know like yes the you know the tradition one athlete has the the ripped abs and the Statue of David like body that they can like salivate over but you know which is awesome yes grace so awesome and yet I've never and I'm sure you've never looked at a guy that has that and felt outclassed well no because of anything is less evolutionary pressure on that guy to develop these skills I've rarely had it you want to know who's taking girls off me like basically like Australian guys or like British guys that are just like like old cabs or labs or something that rent me laughs yes not touches fucking pleasure and it they have a lot of time they have that but there because women are typically at the effect and men are typically typically the cause a lot of what I see is girls who like they're looking at the better-looking guys and they're aware of them but I've never seen it to where if you project energy they they don't bite and then they just keep looking over at the guy that's why I've never really felt out man not only that but I actually feel like those guys are at a deficit because by being better-looking they've never been forced to really look at themselves and now they're projecting themselves and it's a lot like a rich kid who really never learns how to make money because they assume they have it and then they want it broke at the in their lives well yeah I mean and the thing as those guys are dirty again you is going to say news fades charisma increases right now granted one could argue that over you know the lifetime of these guys just getting pussy left and right they gain a certain entitlement and maybe by osmosis just hanging out with these girls they they learn how to communicate and stuff like that but that's why I've seen some good-looking guys with a shit ton of charisma yeah some have a shit ton but you know what's crazy even then I've never liked that guy has like a 95% charisma you go in with 96% charisma typically the girl still jumps on you however sometimes that guy does out class you and but when that happens are you ever like wow I just had those actually two inches and then wow no it's because you were kind of going down like a little bitch and you fell into his orbit you fell into his frame you fell into his gravitational pull and you're kind of like became a spectator and then he gets you but it's not because like he just stood there like what the proud Dalmatian or something was because it's like it's it's it's on you I'm sure those cases of it but it but that's not the matter already cases of it I mean like for example if I go out with you know a buddy of mine this guy's a real natural he and he he's just a very physical type you know he's a super fun guy but he's very physical if I'm approaching the same girl I were both trying to get that girl this guy is not going to make gay mistakes cuz he doesn't he's a natural you know he's very good game but at the same time it just on any given Sunday it's like who what style of the girl prefer if she likes a more physicality based type game then she's probably gonna go for my buddy but if she is more into like the kind of cerebral guy who can be humorous and and we have you know drum witticisms like he's Oscar fucking wild my buddy doesn't set a fucking chance like she he can do whatever he wants and she will not go because she's just like it's like they roll their eyes with them yeah exactly but if I it's like the moths to the flames and really just something to kind of wrap with so this video is a primer okay so we've mentioned a couple elements of why you want to learn it but also more importantly in this video the purpose is to draw your awareness to this and so going forward in some future videos that we have coming out you'll see previews of how to actually tackle if you want to go further do the program which I highly urge you to do I'm looking forward to doing it so I've seen something you can even hear me I need to do it so I'm really excited about it but do the program but for now enjoy the previews which will show more rubber meets the road and again drawing your attention to this really what I want you to take out of this video we're hoping for you here is that you understand that there's a as you said it's sort of a grammar to this that there's energies that are being put in use and this is something that you can use even if you don't you could be like a 17 year old kid or some like that who just wants to get some charisma and this is a tool in your toolbox where if you don't have it you're kind of at a deficit and when you do have it you have an unfair advantage but most importantly this one I like about it it's just fucking fun it's just a rush it's exciting and it's fun believe me when you know how to hold that attention what do you think's going to happen to your inner game what does that do to yourself to see when you walk into an environment and you're at the cause on the effect what does that do when you see that business guy that you want to network with and you know how to cut your way through the crowd get the energy on you and get him calling you you know getting the girl chasing you and it where does it come what what is the fuel to this just wanted to kind of like touch base bring awareness of this stuff and over the course of the next several videos we'll be digging into this stuff as you said in a more rubber meets the road way so very excited to get into that whole open a whole can of worms hopefully got your attention I screamed like a retard for you what else do you want to shake myself what do you need me to do right so got we got your tension is actually tension so next few videos get excited to dig into this start change your life we'll talk to you soon peace  do a quickie little breakdown on what happened there and I would have time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the set set set set 80% of the time this is the problem hey hi freeze motherfucker a good evening he doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him so by the finest function she [Music] this is the roof of the mouth right here  right yes smelling something nice touching shoulders ah that's the touchdown right they're not just being loud but being clear so this right sometimes people will say what they heard you they heard the noise good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purse pour you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps with cheese and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding [Music] I'm good so uncool you look nice clenching it here oh geez yeah and that's what we don't want okay this we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow there's - oh line this is probably what my boss's cords look like Island City on me anytime what are you fucking talking about oh I'm like literally cringing you're dead she was like my voice told us like oh like average above average but yours is like a baby yeah don't do that so connect sit down shut up bum blah the other two get down you're down your job job yeah you're dumb your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a to MIT where we're telling stories you want to be more excited or do you need to be more like calm and collected and that will change often dynamically during the interaction itself it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn the stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice you're going to be able to go out and take your finger like this and push it push it and then and that weird it's the weirdest thing when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I truly believe this it's only a matter of time until they like awesome and victus I love my family gave me a huge awareness of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicality behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling in jr. put on a personal no father like hello but all in all I write that you know it's a little act and that success foxy quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game concept I was like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve we're so so so long [Music]  you  Oh  [Music],SrsK59wqwR0
so now you got a girl in the stable weather obnoxious term I can use to describe the hair of the stable yeah that you gotta grow on your team now that sounds a little more benign right she's on your team but those girls can blow out for any moment to for any reason they might move they might get a boyfriend who is emotionally available they might you might show up for a date high on mushrooms to a fancy restaurant and be gibbering at the waiters and laughing at the other people next to you she didn't like that you might you might do any number of things but the girl could just blow out yeah so the thing with cop and blow it's very cook it's very easy to become complacent isn't it especially if you have a large team it's a constant cycle now many guys can't deal with this they can't deal with it because it's emotionally too there's too much uncertainty you know it's too much uncertainty they want to have the cake and eat it too they want this to bility and the intimacy of a relationship but they also want all these girls it's like look man I don't expect any of these girls to be ended it with me a lot of them fall in love me whatever it's not reciprocated and that's not because I'm this cold motherfucker but it's for their benefit because I know I don't want to hurt them you know and if you cannot be half a gangster if you're going to be in a relationship be in relationship to the hilt you know go to the top chef party go to Napa enjoy it love it embrace it be it when it's settlers of catan I'm pretty good at it I start with I start collecting wood early and do you actually know what settlers of catan is yeah super fun board game it's about sharing cooperation that is the big lesson I learned from this last relationship I was in you know I was starting to feel kind of like a trained ninja commando assassin who was being used to like clean someone's kitchen or something you don't use a ninja doesn't clean kitchens a ninja kills people  right efficiently like and that's I'm a ninja man I'm a soldier so I had to get out of it but I let it you know and it was really bad i really regret it i really regret a lot of things about that but again you know you're not winning you're learning so I learned a lot in the future but do get a relationship I will be either fully in it or not if I do come across a girl did it come across if I do come across a girl that for why fall in love I'm not I haven't closed myself off to that possibility but right now right now I just feel like it's full beast mode right now so and again it's part it's where you are in your life I had no idea even six months ago that there was a new level to this that I could attain I had no idea but it's like that old Rilke quote you know the German poet is what do you say uh don't try it don't look for the answers now because you could not understand them now instead live the questions now and maybe one day gradually without even noticing it you will live your way into the answers like I've just lived my way into this new level of so everything happens for a reason so if an old man once told me is like love is like a summer breeze Jeff just because you open the window doesn't mean it will necessarily come in but you could also open several windows and try to get a draft going alright so  you,SypZVTOTXZQ
yo yo what up its your boy Jaffe I'm here in front of some kind of church or something with about a hundred of my good friends from China and today I want to talk about some of the main keys that will help you when you're first trying to learn let me remind you putting these videos out every single Tuesday Taco Tuesday so if you want to hear the real chef in the horse's mouth from somebody who's been doing this stuff and teaching it professionally for 16 years be sure to hit that like button and hit that subscribe button so you could be notified whenever I drop the next video now I'm not gonna lie okay learning pick up it can be a difficult process and what makes it so hard though is that the process of learning is quite different from pretty much anything else you might try to learn right with most activities you could just push really hard and get the job done you know even if you're tensed about it even if you're frustrated or anxious you can use that energy to propel you to push harder and push through it but you know when you're talking to a girl or even just public speaking for that matter you ever notice that when you start trying really really hard everything actually falls apart and has a detrimental opposite effect it's kind of weird huh well the same sort of heart exertion that you put into things like hitting the gym lifting weights sports studying for your classes or you know even your day-to-day tasks your job well that doesn't work at all when you're trying to apply it and learn pick up in the field and this is because socializing is emotional okay this is also a huge difference that I notice between students that are total novices and students who say for example have taken previous boot camps or I've been practicing this stuff for a while the more advanced students who've been in the field for some time well they're simply able to learn it better why because they've learned how to they've learned how to prevent themselves from getting locked up and from getting tense when they go out so both students the novice and the event more advanced guy there you know both really determined really eager to learn but the one that's had more experience understands a few fundamental concepts that really make a whole world of difference so I'm gonna numerate some of these right now you know they understand that the basket he understands that they've got to stay outside of their heads okay he has to have fun he has to be a relaxed has to be loose and perhaps most of all he needs to have positive energy okay now for some people watching this it may sound like stuff that you've heard over and over again but haven't successfully applied maybe to others these concepts might be totally new and unclear and to a few of you that have been in the field for a while you know there's a lineup to this stuff it may be already internalized in you okay this is all fundamental stuff but it's gonna go a long way in aiding your progress if you're not already following them so I want you to think about this rough list that I'm gonna about to say here and ask yourself if you're violating any of them so the first one is this understand that you got to take it slow okay a while back I had a middle-aged students who had essentially been pretty shy most of his life and just started practicing pickup and this guy was determined that his goal he was determined to have a threesome off cold approach within a month after the boot camp okay now I mean that's great and all and you know it'd be really awesome if he did and frankly I've seen stranger things happen but frankly it really wasn't the least bit realistic given that he just started out okay so this guy he was making the mistake of being way too anxious for quick results and the analogy I told him I you actually said this I say this a lot it's like dude this is like the beginner motorcycle class where we're teaching you how to stand on the bike and how to start it and go in a slow circle in the parking lot and then you pipe up you're like when do we jump the ducati over the Snake River okay it's like you're not quite there yet buddy right so the thing is I knew the guy I like in these guys in general they want it bad and that's why they took a weekend off work you know they flew over to meet me wherever I happen to be and they took the boot camp but this guy as well as a lot of people may be watching this have to realize that this is a gradual process now obviously the more work you put into it continuously the more you're gonna get out of it but don't be so hard pressed for quick results or else you know you're gonna be essentially being too hard on yourself right you're gonna get frustrated you're gonna get stressed out than you even should be and that is the outcome that you want to avoid above all else you don't want to hate going to the gym right because then you're just not gonna go you're gonna burn out so I want you to realize that any guy that you've met who's naturally really good with girls has probably been unconsciously practicing this stuff since he was 12 years old you know since you first got a little hair on his dick okay so really think about this to put things in perspective and you know great you know you're trying to get a threesome within a month you know is that is that realistic not necessarily so set realistic goals like you want the bar to be high enough so it's challenging but not so high that it's impossible okay so set realistic goals acknowledge the fact that this is a long-term thing okay it's gonna take time and more importantly no matter how long it takes you're gonna do it okay it takes time to internalize new behaviors new mindsets and you know furthermore to reverse current ones that might be disempowering so try to enjoy the ride appreciate those small changes you're making each day in other words celebrate small victories and you know take baby steps set small goals for yourself every time that you go out okay get over your fear of approaching okay got that that's like the first one got that shit down cool now learn how to keep a stimulating conversation and vibe well okay now after that learn how to create tension then learn how to have physically escalate and so on and so forth so like I said set small goals for yourself every night that you go out that way you look at every night as a success regardless of whether you pulled or not because you know you realize that you're just starting to learn the stuff so that's number one take any slow number two is discipline and if you follow my buddy RSD max you know he's really big on this kind of stuff on discipline and sticking to your goals right so have a regimen commit yourself to a certain number of times you're gonna go out every week okay or a certain number of approaches you're gonna do every night when you go out and mind you when I say approach I mean real approaches not this stuff where you like you know the girl walks by and you mumble some half utter gibberish at her and then she just kind of walks by and ignores you like a fly that she doesn't even understand what the fuck you said you're like one approach down like no I mean a real approach where you actually get in front of her and you you make a decision to gage okay so look this isn't really in vogue these days I know but it could be very helpful to keep a journal to record your progress and most importantly you should be constantly critiquing yourself after every night out so as to constantly learn more to constantly improve okay now cultivate discipline with this the same way a bodybuilder or a professional athlete would so have faith in your game and have a game plan okay have faith in your game plan and stick to it keep pushing yourself to accomplish successively more difficult goals and also keep learning from your mistakes right Third Point here remember that pick up is a hobby and have fun with it okay there's a fine line between taking it too slow so as to make very little progress and then conversely being so disciplined and determined that you get so frustrated and stressed out from not keeping up just like strict impossible regimen or maybe you do but if you end up neglecting other parts of your life so you've got to be flexible you got to leave yourself some leeway but what I take what I say take it slow I mean in terms of your perspective right just acknowledging that this is for the long run so like I said you know I've said this in other videos you gotta have balance so like for every three nights out you go out to practice pick up maybe you set one off night just to hang out with your friends you know work on your social circle or something similar right the point is to have a life outside of this stuff otherwise you'll actually end up hurting your game long-term and you know you don't want to be that like creepy little guy that just lurks on his computer watching RC videos all day and then you like drips away at night and it's like matrix-style trench coat and it's like flame boots and feather boa to go out picking up girls okay if you put all your time into this then every time you go out you're gonna be very hard on yourself more than you even should be from not getting results quickly so realize that you know so-called tight game isn't just having cool stories and and and these witty remarks and playful banter tight game means having a tight personality so it's important that you cultivate more and more life experience by engaging in activities other than just picking up okay to enrich that personality like for example a lot of times I'll see guys like they make comments on my Instagram they'll see me gardening or maybe like hanging out with civilian friends doing nothing or cooking and then like where's the girls how does this help me get girls it's like dude are you fucking kidding me man it's because I have a fucking life and in fact these things are a big part of what makes an overall attractive personality right so instead of treating this as something that just takes over your life which I see a lot more than younger guys by the way make it just one of many things that are kind of part of a fundamental transformation within you all right number four be social and be positive now look what I mean by being social like as soon as you go into a venue you should hit up a group this is a big rule that I that has helped me massively over over the years and like if I violate fucks me up to this day like as soon as you get into the venue you need to step to a group and start talking okay no hesitation warm up get the ball rolling as soon as possible make it a goal to follow what we call it we used to go used to call this three set rule in other words getting those first three approaches out of the way as soon as possible so as to get warmed up in other words you've got to get on top of the club before it gets on top of you and this is one of the most important things that I've learned throughout my entire history my entire career of pick up as soon as you set foot in that venue you got to think of it as though you're a surfer on a surfboard on the ocean and a wave starts you know swelling up behind you if you want to catch that wave you got to start putting in work you can start paddling otherwise what happens boom it crests it crashes down upon you now you're getting knocked around underneath just at the mercies of the environment right so if you want to like get up and sort riding that wave you got to put in that work pop up and then you can begin enjoying yourself and being effective in that environment so don't expect yourself to always feel on okay it's gonna come as you warm up and as you get yourself into a talkative state right maybe chat up everyone shut up and do China bum fat old lady whatever just to get yourself insane otherwise you have a tendency to procrastinate and you may very well end up not doing any approaches for the majority if not all of the night right there's an inertia to action and there's an inertia to inaction so understand that be Social Work the room talk to whoever you come by okay don't let yourself pass any time without actually socializing you wanna hit a nice rhythm don't like do an approach and then wait around for five minutes etc etc if you just like show it around the bar for 20 minutes just observing everyone else and ogling all the girls their value scanning you have a tendency to get locked up for the rest of the night and to add to that you lose social value being that like little value scanning desperate guy who's just like staring at everyone else partying and having a good time okay you want to be the guy that's having a blast you want to be the guy that's you know got swarms of people around him you want to be the guy who's in his own reality and not standing there procrastinating okay and even while you're with a girl like have fun with it bust on our teaser scratcher behind the ear and saying she's a kitten filled with love dance with her whatever just have fun if you're not genuinely enjoying yourself when you're talking to them well they probably aren't either and overall really strive to maintain a positive mentality overall okay so say for example when you're out critiquing yourself at the end of the night rather than just immediately you know kicking yourself for whatever mistakes you made always ask yourself what did I do well and furthermore what can I do better next time and the beauty of this is that it makes you appreciate your strengths and it acknowledges the progress that you've made so far while pinpointing those areas for improvement now other than that I noticed that lots of students are really down in regards to issues outside the scope of pickup okay usually like a negative internal dialogue or thought patterns you know just in general and for this I highly recommend books by our old buddy Anthony Robbins and of course good old Eckhart Tolle and of course many many others in fact you can check out my whole list of book recommendations over at my site go to jail acts comm forward slash books and those are all my book recommendations that might be helpful so again these points they are very basic and they might seem like common sense but they are essential for progressing and they're often overlooked by guys starting out and this is the same reason why I really respect guys that have made huge leaps in their game because of that learning for I know that not only is that guy a pimp but he's also a highly disciplined highly determined highly intelligent and most likely a very overall positive guy that'll be cool to hang out with and this is the kind of guy that like reeks of confidence and reeks of success and I want you to reach that why because well when I teach students I see myself sixteen years ago standing in their shoes and the same goes for all the other RC instructors you know I could put all of my heart all of my soul and jump-starting your skills and one weekend on a bootcamp but whether you keep that a post bootcamp is entirely dependent on you right it's like quitting smoking losing weight being successful financially or successful at anything in life you just got to step up and you've just got to do it now a lot of the stuff that I talk about in these videos a lot of stuff is about how I learned how to do it a lot of it is about how you could do it better and the rest is what I call a permission slip you can you should and if you're brave enough to start you will this is Jeffy and I'll see you next time,T2dN9WwTkss
yo yo yo what's up it's your proverbial boy Jeffy and I'm here today with the one the only Nicholas co-founder of real social dynamics a bit of a shadowy figure a shadowy obscure figure not many people know about your your jams or that you did recently start a new YouTube channel correct what's special Nick Oh official that's what's called Nicole official Nicole official and you talk on there about your business experiences and you know again you used to be a pickup guy back in the day but now you're a married man a family man with three cats and a wife and three cats and and so you've kind of again taken more of a role in the business aspects as well as I'm sure you've got some other things going on besides rst - and I like musical ferocity hip-hop musical I would say it's still part of RSD okay so you're doing a hip-hop musical a hip hopera about in the in the vein of Hamilton about real social dynamics and found out about Hamilton after we started a process learning how to rap so to sheer coincidence looking forward to having Owen rap I just want a good musical number I want there to be a couple rules number one it needs to rock number two no downer lyrics number three it needs to be about love number four it needs to have a super dramatic key change at some point number five it should have an interesting bridge and last but not least it should have a high note which I might not be able to hit but if I do I look like a hero and last but not least I like it to end just kind of end not fade away with vamping you know but more like a dinner yeah okay so  that's the criteria that was actually your high note for the chebyshev's what reminded me of how they would be such an epic performance to have you actually up there in that day well you know I've been I'm getting a bit older now and so you lose the ability to belt those things out but much like Nolan Ryan both in game athleticism and your voice you can use technique to stay in the game and stay competitive longer you know obviously I'd say my game is at an apex of what it much higher than what it ever wasn't as a young man and that's you know granted I don't have like the the raw athleticism anymore but I have technique that allows me to stay competitive oh yeah resonators yes as well yeah exactly so I'm very excited about that but I want to talk more about you you know you're got you here on the show on the Jesse show here today and one thing I've always really admired about you is you have this seemingly innate ability to dipshit done and what I say get shit done I mean to just blast through red tape to blast through almost conventional channels of how to solve problems and you get it done I'd say that the case in point let me let me explain I'm talking about here like let's say for example you go to the airport and your flight has you've been unfairly bumped off your flight or something like this so if you go to the the counter and start dealing with the customer service agent and you're like look this is absurd this is not what's gonna happen you're gonna put me on the fucking thing what's likely to happen if you were I do this they're probably gonna call the cops or security and be like this guys getting this guy's getting out of hand take him and take him to the Derka Derka room and work him over with a baton or whatever the fuck happens back there if MIT goes up there and says this for some weird reason they just go yes sir immediately and and I've seen this happen with all sorts of authority figures again stuff if you and I did it would get us fucking beat up and like dismiss for some reason something about the way that you communicate with these people inspires like fear fear and like just makes them comply well the interpretation we call impersonation of me this is what's gonna be done you're gonna do with it and then they just do it I'm like dude if I say this shit I would be like no get out of here well I think that a lot of the conversation that you see me do in terms of getting things done like that has not just been about my voice or the loudness of my voice well yeah this is something these words that come out of my mouth exactly that's kind of one I want to explore there's some sort of like an eight so mindset you have it done I'm looking for people and I'm trying to come from the standpoint of what is this person looking at me and see okay what do they what do I want them to see so what I'm trying to get something done I want them to see a situation where they kind of feel obliged to help okay I have to help you so classy and okay oh there's bumped off a fight for example I would explain to them you know what's going on here I might even get manager in the fall they don't have the power and authority because they might not be the one to make decision err just following orders but they could see from my standpoint for example bumping off the flight was your example so my position would be supercilious isn't there like a second like a chargeback but for not too because I also write reviews management can get involved I don't want to put them in an impotent position we're not doing their job and they want to do their job and but the thing is it's also very common things doesn't get done and have to get done now so I put all these things they kind of stack them when I'm trying to get things done if it's that or whether it's trying to get access to a certain exclusive event or they're trying to close a business deal or a contract I'm trying to figure out whether we're in a position where it's a go situation that they kind of see it from my position and I could show the mouse to see from theirs but at the same time if it's something that I believe very firmly I think that's the times where you see me get aggressive I think naturally I had a dad that was always very very loud when are you trying to educate me I kind of pick that up so I might be very loud with somebody yeah but I'm not trying to yell at them I'm trying to just explain to them something and I get when I get I guess talk to my wife about this when I get into the mode where I'm kind of very loud yeah or angry that'd be a good way to put it that's what I would call the mode because I've seen you go into the mode like most of the time you're hanging out you know you're you know you're a little loud York a boisterous whatever but like when you go to that it's like and then something clicks and you're like this is business time and exactly I think it I think a lot of people they they see that from afar maybe or they might get the impression that you're again the key distinction here is I don't think that you're like yelling at these people you're simply because again if you yell at these people you're getting a no where you might if you're gonna be worse off they're gonna bump you to the lower flight right but there's something you have this combination of it's very forceful but very respectful it's like within the parameters of business still you know I'm there I don't know if I've ever heard you call them a a peon or anything like that to their face but but again so it's this combination this very kind of forceful but at the same time it's not disrespectful but something about like not just again the voice the the whole demeanor just suggests this is a person who if they don't get what they want they will likely cause some sort of issue I will and have often times not management involved in it's caused issues for people that just failed to do their job I think the issue is not that you see me in situations where people are you know listening to what I'm saying they're doing something that believe is just obligatory because of bad business right and and I think further you're also you're also able to articulate it in a way that's clear that that gives them the impression that this guy knows what he's talking about he's not just again the tenth customer who doesn't who's just a moron and is this up here ranting you know dirt or I'm mad I'm mad you're like look I feel this has occurred this is what I would like to happen here's why I believe it should happen but yet at the same time in a loud louder way any business or social interaction QWERTY of expectations is the biggest thing that people need to fall yeah I remember in school we would call it social violations or it's the mismatch of expectations and the biggest thing you can do is to clarify those things whether it's in business have relationships - yeah I mean I think that happens all the time even within ours diva work relationships within our company all the time yeah and as a result were just so good at focusing on what those are that's why the company's still around today whereas most companies go out of business first nine years and out because of this exactly it's also the main reason why most relationships fail friendships speaking of that speaking of that you know I've seen on many occasions you and Owen kind of go at it butt heads over a business decision or a variety of different things and it sometimes will be doing and I've been around you guys I've known you guys for fucking 15 years but like you know we'll be out somewhere there would be other people around who aren't as close and you'll see you guys are going at it and they're like oh my god it's just a problem is this a is this a problem ag9 and I that's just how they do it because again he's very opinionated you're very opinionated but to the outside observer it looks like fighting but most suits are mine and yeah I think that we do it relentlessly we say exactly how it is and we could do that because we know our intentions are good for each other when I grew up my family especially on my dad's side his parents they would talk to my dad and it sound like they're arguing the whole time we're not arguing yeah you want to run up-to-date you hear you're like we've got some like someone's fighting oh my god you run upstairs and they're just like talking yeah one thing that I learned from both you and Owen was don't don't go to the easy place of telling us yourself a story about what you think is happening right you know because I think that's a big issue and you know we've discussed this we've gone into we've taken seminars in RSD where one of them was we was at the what was the Crucial Conversations course and one big thing I learned from there is that again when you have a situation in front of you that seems there seems to be a difference of opinion it's very easy to get into the headspace where you're like putting you're putting a story on to the person you're like this is what their motivation is you don't know what their motivation is but you're saying yourself they're doing this because this and I think once you get into that headspace it's very easy to take it to like an emotional space where it's not gonna resolve itself in a in a good way stories versus facts yeah I think is the key I mean Crucial Conversations in the buy in the situation where you have three things to make an acoustic conversation as opposed just you and I talking which is high stakes yeah different opinions and hardcore emotions behind these negative and if you are missing any of those three elements you don't have that crucial conversation in terms of like stakes being high so let's say for example the the bump from the flight obviously you want to get the stakes are high because you have to get to your meeting or whatever situation like that yeah and then you know you believe that this other person is acting in bad faith and you're pissed off etc etc so yeah so focusing on the fact I mean that's a good point because I think a lot of the things that I want to focus on it's not subjective so a lot of people will say hey what you're doing here is wrong because you're acting really stupidly yeah this is bad airlines are operating like this those are all those are all kind of subjective whereas a FAC would be I paid for a 5 s bicker or tongue the money I spent well this was this if I don't get to this meeting I will be out this much money if I won't get this done we're having a problem here your claim that you can't get stuff done never forget management involved they're representing the company as much as you so I need this to get done now those are all facts so I'm focusing on those things they can't objectively throw their story on me and that's how you get things done I think it's funny to your touch it's like even hearing you say it right now the tone it's I wouldn't categorize it as angry but it you know it's almost like on the it's like going up to the cliff of angry but it's like urgent I guess with it's crucial yeah it's it's there's a sense of urgency so again if you are in a situation where again you're not seeing eye to eye on someone else whether that's a customer service situation again you've got a can I think just to recap here it's okay to convey a sense of urgency with your demeanor it's not okay to get personal insulting with them it's not okay to get you know overly worked up take to get emotionally invested in it when these situations arise that's exactly how I feel when those emotions come up and I get in that particular mode most of my life though I'm actually quite calm and I'm happy I think that the situation is when business gets tough I get into this business mode where everything's fast or faster because speed execution is king in business yeah gets paid done I feel like in business if you don't do something faster than the next person that person outpaces you pretty much everything so when I get in a business mode I think that goes on in my head I'm just kind of like we're in a race again I feel like everything just speeds up you know what's interesting though sometimes you know different sometimes United take a different approach like here's an example the other day I went to the I was in Illinois I was at my my dead dad's house I was taking care of some his final stuff I wanted to get his medical records and they tell you what to get the medical records you know you should you should go in person so they don't really have time to redact it if there's anything shady going on or something like that so long story short I roll into this office and I'm just like looking super white with a fleece and in a cup of coffee and there's somebody in there in in the records office already like yelling at the person and they're like this is my mother like sorry you know we have you have to it's gonna take this much time to do that and then that person like Huff's out and I'm like hi oh my oh yeah hey I just want to do the right well it's gonna take days I'm like that's totally fine just like chit-chatting and like going into the the mode where I'm like almost rolling my eyes at that other person I've also had situations where and they brought me the records really quick I've also had situations where there was a flight problem and the PERT the people in front of you are like this is fucking ridiculous her to turn to turn and then I go up and I'm like oh what's going on they're like you're bumped I'm like yeah that's not very good I guess anyway when can I get on the next one you're just like chill with them and then they're like well that guy was an asshole you're the nice guy so guess what you're on first class now bitch so again sometimes you want to take that the honey approach other times even you know in a sense of urgency you want to convey that you know go through that crucial conversation very quickly and sometimes you're gonna have a mixture of the two most crucial conversations you don't want to take the more aggressive routes usually a back-and-forth conversation that's why it's conversations yeah dictates crucial argument we're talking about crucial specify herd tactics that you were wanting me to yeah you can bring out I think that's important I think that most of my conversations say with Owen have all of the quicker routes and I think that a law that has kind of like spread down in terms of like my reputation within RSD because they see me you know when talking with each other than that well you know it is a business thing to so there's speed of implementation required and you know it's fast paced as moving things are changing and you've got to make those kind of decisions so yeah I know I see where you're coming from on that for sure but yeah look man we're gonna roll out to this this phenomenal party right now and back at the back of the house so I guess we'll cut it off here unless you want to say any final words and wonderful listeners what's your channel by the way so again Nick low official Nick the co official please check it out if you liked this video like subscribe and I'll see you next week at RC Jeff [Music],T8vWvm0QdbU
this is Jeff with real social dynamics I'm coming at you today from San Francisco California to talk about narcissism I want to talk today about how most people are actually getting it wrong the difference between healthy and unhealthy narcissism and how some of the most influential people throughout history have actually used narcissism in order to motivate themselves to achieve their goals so the other day I was sitting on the toilet perusing the most recent copy of Scientific American as I am want to do in such situations and I came across an excerpt from a recent book by Jeffrey Kluger who writes for Time magazine and this book he just put out is called the narcissist next store that aims to explore narcissism and you know get to the bottom of a lot of the fallacies surrounding etc etc etc in the book Kluger states that basically narcissism has three main characteristics and those characteristics are as follows number one grandiosity okay and grandiosity is this belief that you're a special person that your life is somehow epic that you're somehow better smore special than other people you're smarter than other people the second characteristic is of course entitlement the belief that the universe owes you things I believe that you deserve rewards that you deserve applause that you deserve love in fact you are entitled to this and in the book Kluger talks about how babies actually have supreme entitlement right when the little baby when he doesn't get to cookie and he starts crying he's not actually is he's not sad that he didn't get the cookie he's fucking outraged he's fucking outraged that he's not being given this cookie that he is clearly obviously entitled to okay so grandiosity entitlement and the third is of course empathy they they don't have the typical empathetic breaks that might prevent another person from like steamrolling over someone else's idea or just you know going first in a situation things of that nature now if you look at it from a dating perspective a a cold approach pickup perspective two of these traits are actually beneficial to what we're trying to accomplish when you're trying to walk up to a stranger and get them engaged with you and get them to like you enough to you put their mouth on your mouth and possibly elsewhere alright so those of course grandiosity is this belief that your life is epic journey is gonna contribute to that okay entitlement is of course a term that gets bandied around quite a bit in the pickup community you need to feel entitlement you need to feel like the girl's not on a pedestal that she's not somehow better than you that you deserve to be with an attractive woman so these are good things but of course the third lack of empathy this is a huge stumbling block for someone who wants to connect with other people however perhaps counter-intuitively the narcissist is able to fake this now of course this is not something that we want to emulate we don't want you to teach how to fake empathy but knowing that those other two characteristics can be beneficial in a cold approach pickup situation we can leverage that to give her something what could cause a healthy narcissism again it's narshall some good is it bad it can be both it can be either/or Kluger makes a distinction between clinical narcissism right the clinical pathology the clinical personality disorder called narcissism right NPD and this is about one to three percent of the population actually has this and this would be extremely detrimental you know someone who has this is going to constantly be getting in arguments and you know contra Tom like with other people that they encounter out in the world you know they're gonna knock up against people quite a bit however you know if you go down in the spectrum you're not that that upper case narcissism is what he calls a lower case narcissism well in many cases that could be just the case of a person with a robust ego and you know who's charming so and expressing yourself in this way this narcissism there's lower case narcissism can provide a great outlet for you to express yourself creatively and things of that nature right and it's interesting because they talked about narcissist in bed and he says that that lower case narcissism will never disappear from the gene pool right they'll never weed itself out because it's quite adaptive at replicating itself narcissists are very good at replicating themselves now look not too long ago a couple years ago Tyler had an idea and then he put forth that we each have differing sides different facets to our personalities for example a person might have an adventurous side and a conservative side they might have an irreverent side and a respectful side they might have a humble side any narcissistic side and it's porn to know when to bring each of those to the fore dynamically in different situations to achieve the outcome that you want to achieve so for example back in 2010 I put out a video where we went to the Gay Pride Festival here in San Francisco and we were kind of beasting around you know meeting girls and things of that nature and so at one part of the video I actually start making out with this girl and I see another girl out of the corner of my eye walk by because even though I'm like looking right here I'm focusing on what's happening right in front of me I do maintain peripheral awareness of what's going on and so I see another girl that I had thought was cute earlier walked by so my art got snakes out boom I pull her in and I say I think you should make out with this girl - and I orchestrate the girls to make out anyway immediately after this we walk off I walk out from my original girl and I'm like hahaha I said just like a fucking Mako with her ha ha ha ha and the girl says to me she says I did that for you and my immediate response is fuck you I'm Jeff Allen now when I watched that video the following day when I like took the video off the camera and watched it for the first time and I saw that part fuck you I'm Jeff Allen I like my honest reaction was like wow Jesus Christ that's a bit it's a bit untoward if you will huh right like what the fuck I was a little taken aback by how arrogant and ridiculous it was but here's the thing when I wake up in the morning and I brush my teeth in the mirror and I see myself there I look at myself and I see there's Jeff he's a work in progress like everyone else and I do have humility to me all right I'm not just walking around blithely thinking I'm the greatest fucking thing on earth since sliced bread ok pretty damn cool but not that cool right you know there's still work to be on a daily basis to polish the term so to speak but but anyway uh but it's important to note that when pickup time comes - it's out the window and it's it's I'm Jeff fucking Allen bitch okay and that's something that I've cultivated over the years because I've seen not not necessarily consciously but unconsciously why because it's what works that's an important distinction a lot of people come into the game and they want to look at it through the lenses of how they'd like things to be you know they want the game to be beautiful they want it to be poetic they want it to be this I wanted to be that whatever but again I always urge people to not look at how you'd like things to work look at what actually works and through years and years of feedbag in my over a decade of going out and cold approaching strangers I've discovered that you know having a certain confidence have any certain almost arrogant edge to your personality actually works in your favor right so again I wouldn't do it if it didn't work but at the same time I know when humility needs to come into play so it's like look in the book Kluger talks about different different historical figures different political figures in particular and we the example he gives or one of many is that of John Edwards versus Bill Clinton now these are both so called narcissistic personalities but with John Edwards people really didn't take to him in the way they did they did and still do Bill Clinton because with Edwards he was kind of like vain about it right he seemed kind of preening kind of there's a lot of vanity to it and you know they may have liked him but it when you're interact with him there's something kind of skeevy right again this is what Kluger says was book you know you couldn't help but feel you were being sold a bill of goods so to speak when you interact with that guy now Clinton on the other hand it's like you know he's a charmer you know the guy's fuckin he's putting it on right you know he's seducing you but you know he is so good at it you just kind of think all right I don't care you know I know we seriously I just don't care go ahead do it you don't it's not just this delusional sense of self-worth I base my love for myself and when I'm throwing down on what I've accomplished in my life you know getting up there in years I'm almost 40 and so I've done a lot of travel a lot I've been a lot of places I've done a lot of things that helped a lot of people I've had a lot of crazy experiences I mean I was in Alex was visiting me a couple weeks ago in San Francisco here and as he's like going through my house he's like picking up every single thing is like everything in this house mate it's like an artifact of some amazing story and I'm like yeah it kind of is right so having that I mean I kind of base my self-love that's my accomplishments and my pride on that but on a deeper level it's also it also needs to be based upon whether or not you are living up to your core values and I think fundamentally that's really where it's at you know am i living in alignment with the the things that the values and characteristics that I want to embody when I see myself at my best right when I see myself at my best not a petty little guy not you know a generous giving person who's you know funny charming outgoing right that guy so it's interesting you're I've always said that your own it you have to get to a point where your own opinion of yourself matters more highly than that of other people's opinion of you right and that's essential to happiness I think in in this modern day and age but that only works if you're living up to your own personal standards now in most contexts the term narcissist is thrown around as a pejorative term right like it's a bad thing and of course in the case of the so called big n the clinical pathology obviously that's going to be the case however with this lower case narcissism this can actually prove to be an incredibly energizing and motivating force to help you get what you want out of your life and Klugman gives examples of a couple of individuals who would probably typically be thought of as rather selfless Martin Luther King and Mahatma Gandhi and he suggests that when they were giving these orations these speeches to these incredible crowds for example MLK is standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial real and addressing hundreds of thousands of people and just raising them to his cause that had to have felt awesome that had they have given them a thrill on some level right to be up there doing that it suggests otherwise just countered a human nature period that's narcissism now I'm sure being up there felt awesome as it would to anyone with a healthy ego however these were also very wise and self-aware people who knew how to kind of keep that narcissism in its box I got to kind of compartmentalize it so they could take advantage of the benefits of so-called narcissistic traits while staying away from the disadvantages and as a counterpoint Clubman actually brings up Steve Jobs who was a white at least a widely documented abusive narcissist who while on the one hand he contributed immensely to Apple and to many ways society at large he wasn't well liked by the people he worked with even though they actually they knew he was right about everything they'd actually didn't get along well with him so the key here is humility when you're out there at a party interacting with people when you're in a business meeting and making deals what-have-you or even doing cold approach walk ups it's very important that you're able to get turn that throttle on be confident charismatic you know have that sense that healthy sense of entitlement right kind of have that grandiose heir to your interactions however when you're brushing your teeth in the morning looking yourself in the fucking mirror you also need to be able to take inventory it's a there's Jeff or whatever the fuck your name is and you know he's a work in progress like everyone else and continuing sharpening that saw as well so anyway hope you like this I'll see you next week this has been Jeffie god bless you and God bless america,TVRh_5UYlEY
what's up is Tyler in Chevy sure no special dynamics there at Harvard campus Massachusetts at Rupp and Landon nerds and today's topic is what to do if you are crazy motherfucker studying real social dynamics so as you guys probably know you know I live in San Francisco Bay Area and I conduct many of my boot camps there so a lot of the time I'll get individuals from Silicon Valley IT profession engineers that sort of you know that sort of thing and these guys they're very very logical and a lot of times that proves to be their kind of biggest biggest challenge in the field because you know in fact this is what a lot of times laws these guys to game the fact that they they think okay I can learn these these arbitrary rules that govern human interaction I can protect myself I'll never have to feel bad again right and you know they think it's like some kind of little pseudo ku game if they just figure out the fucking puzzle then they will you know the problems will be solved the heavens 11 their prayers be answered so they learn all the theory they study incessantly they get it all down they memorized they go onto the field and what ends up happening does this help them does their logic help them infield no logic ends up fisting them in the ass figuratively of course you know this is this is the more prevalent problem especially again in you know where where I'm from and I'd say overall most the students would get yeah that's probably the issue it's like 95 percent and even with students that are pretty cool and caring what people think is still the issue like it's the universal issue for like 95 percent of guys but there is a small minority for whom this is not the issue the small minority for whom the problem is not an issue of too few balls but too much balls and too little brain and again it's a rare thing but we do see from time to time just given the the massive you know preponderance of students that we've gotten over the years it's something that we do we do catch from time to time so you know we kind of want to if you're one of these guys if you if you already don't give a fuck too little of a fuck this is for you what I notice is that guys that are good with girls they're able to go up to the girl and kind of like look her in the eye and not flinch right so it's like it's like this like fearless look and it gets the girl kind of like excited or whatever but what happens with the guys that just really don't give a fuck at all is that they go up and they have this like unflinching thing but then like even on like those little parts where there should be this like social pinging back-and-forth of like showing you know reciprocated social cues they're still kinda like like that right and so what happens usually these are the type of dudes that they can get girls very attracted for about 30 seconds to a minute like really attract I've seen some of these dudes like roll in on like girls with a group of guys on them just like like grab them uh like that and then what once of happening is that you know the girls into it for a minute but then she's like holy shit until the moment she's able to actually discern that he has zero attunement to her subjective reality and is merely blithely in his own like the world attempting to like shoehorn his his a world view of what sirs be game into her you know it's like this this what I say with these guys like this it's like there's a cup right was the girls like subjective experience and here's this game he's like okay  game look good okay like why isn't it working it's it's game game where's the emotional you to guy will be like this if you like game oh it's not working okay let's try that okay boom yeah okay so now the girl sees okay this guy is actually paying attention he's not just blithely spouting this fucking bullshit up in his own head he's actually he's not commuting he's communicating to me as a human being as opposed to a meat sock to jack off into very what we call me you communication as opposed to meet it's communication the in communication is where you are communicating with the other person not as a human being but rather as this some kind of a gent ik means to an end in this case sex one thing I've noticed with like that like that I don't give a fuck guys is that they're actually surprised when we tell them to give more of a fuck right cuz like I thought you said don't give a fuck look I thought I was doing a good you know so like you're actually taking you know a situation where it was already kind of messed up and it's going even more hardcore so if that's you alright if you're one of those guys people feel blessed because it's like most people if like this is like the sweet spot most people are starting out over here right in terms of like giving way too much of a fuck and then you're just like a little bit over here so all you need to do is just be like like that right where's these other people feel like over like many many years right like conditioning this looks like peeling off the approval seeking layers of giving a fuck for like years and years and years so if you're the dude that just doesn't give a fuck all that you need to do is just good just a little bit give up just get a little bit of a fuck just a little bit of a fuck yeah I have a theory about this that I've developed as I've gotten older is that wouldn't were younger when we're well let's say is starting out as a child generally we have a they really don't give that much of a fuck about with you and as we grow older and we become you know getting high school social conditioning begins to you know pile up on us then we get into our you know early late teens early 20s and we can be give quite a fuck quite a fuck we've had quite a large fuck about what people think about it however as you grow on or mature you start to kind of just get less and less and fuck as you realize that it really doesn't matter you know experience bears out that other people's opinions really don't have that much bearing on your life so you start to get less and less of a fuckin so you kind of hit that sweet spot of get up not giving a fuck obviously there's exceptions but generally I think you know between like say 27 35 you're kind of like you just don't care what you think but you still attuned to others then as you get older that you get you give less and less of a fuck until you're so old that now you can relate to anyone at all because you don't give a fuck at all and you're like my grandfather who's 90 years old and just tells stories that never fuckin end ever and he just does not I think that he knows but he just doesn't give a fuck and he's kind of my hero and I think you could probably tell I get a little bit of that from him yeah so it's like if you want to if you want to meet real real hot girls it's like having that element of like kind of craziness to you or you just like to hear yourself talk like that I don't give a fuck right that's good all right sociopath level okay y'all have our own little inner sociopath a little bit right champions peace out  you,Ti2OUx3c6Ss
"yo what up what up mister boy Jeffy coming at you today from San Francisco today I have a question what is it that separates the amateur from the professional is it an innate god-given skills is it hard work passion well while all these things might play a factor I think a lot of the time it's simply a question of knowledge right like a working knowledge of the ins and outs of the game and the ability to see past common misconceptions and see the true path which is frequently counterintuitive okay and dating games it's no different I mean misconceptions about and they have a tendency to separate the players from the poseurs in a heartbeat right and in fact many of these misconceptions you know they're straight up lies propagated by certain aspects of the culture and the media and this can take the form of television programs love songs movies etc and we're exposed to this social conditioning from a very early age okay and it's everywhere it's an escapable maybe it exists I mean one can only speculate but one idea is that maybe it exists cos society as we know it couldn't continue to function without it after all a society where every guy was a full-blown player but likely become unstable and disintegrate but then again who knows that's speculation it might be for all we know it might be a fucking utopia where everyone is harmonious but but whatever the reason it's this social conditioning that keeps most guys from having the kind of sex life they dream about the average guy has less than eight sex partners in his entire life now I don't know about you but that sounds pretty damn weak to me so in the interest of preventing you from becoming another less than eight statistic what I'm going to do here but break down for you some of the more common misconceptions and swirling around in the world of dating and pick up and the first one is this the right way to go about attracting a girl is to logically convince her that you are the best man for her in other words what you need to do is you got to present your case though you're in a court of law you know providing evidence and material witnesses to attest to your status as excellent boyfriend material with photographs of you traveling and rock climbing in a polo shirt well I mean makes sense right if you truly are the best guy were if you were able to prove that she naturally realized that you know the best course of action would be to hook up with you right well it doesn't quite work out that way what's wrong with this very sensible line of reasoning and what it fails to take into account is the fact that attraction has little if anything to do with logic okay attraction is not something that people decide to have for someone all right as a great man once said attraction is not a choice it is something purely natural that can be triggered by someone in a very short time provided he knows what switches to flip so attempting to logically convince a girl like you is like attempting to logically convince a ravenous tiger to not eat you it's probably not gonna work you're gonna end up in a heap on the ground with your heart on your chest you know you can see this you know love the reaction to this like recent media firestorm over my band and my ridiculous behaviors and so forth and you know a lot of the comments were like this guy's ridiculous I would never go out profiler and one look at him in five minutes Blake's his off dude right and that's absolutely true that's absolutely true but they're having a visceral reaction either way I remember back when I was training a Ryan one of the other instructors back in the day he would go out he'd sent me this is kind of a story I'd like to tell a lot he said you know Jeff it's interesting your game because most guys they'll go up to say five girls and say four of the interactions go okay and then they maybe I'm hooking up with one of them he's like you on the other hand you've got the same five girls and three of them immediately despise you they're like fuck this chode get the fuck out of my face right he's like however you hook up with both the other two okay that's because I'm being polarizing now understand this isn't be polarizing simply for the sake of being polarizing what you're doing is you're you're especially some congruently to the hilt all right and when you do this what's typically gonna happen is something if you're gonna be like fuck off right off the bat others gonna be like hahaha yeah you're cool but no thank you and then others gonna be like damn right so the way we see it we don't really see rejection per se anymore right we know as long as what we're doing we're supposed to be doing the expressing or something Gruen lee then you know it's simply a matter of a big part of the fun of our night is going through doing our approaches finding those people we have chemistry with and then letting it go from there there's not a guy on this planet that every girl likes you're on time saying so you know given that it's like I'm just trying to find ones I have chemistry with and then when you do it's interesting because the attraction that's generated from that is ten times more powerful than if you have been like trying to pander and like portray something that's not yourself in order to get attraction okay so again it's a visceral emotional thing again Jeffy's for some not for others I'm totally cool with that so moving on the second one to get a girl it's best to try really hard to win her over and this way she'll see how much you really care and fall in love with you alright I mean dude I don't even know where to start with this shit it all goes back to the concept of value okay people in general and women in this particular instance are attract those they can feel can help them maintain or gain value so what are you sub communicating when you're like following some girl around and you're constantly trying to impress her and pester buying her gifts you know holding up a boom box in front of her house well fucking Peter Gabriel plays  Oh  right well that's right what you're doing is you're letting her know that she's the prize he placed a great deal of value on her it was just another way of saying that you're not someone that can provide any value to her right trying hard to win a rope I mean it's not Noble or gallant it's just me all right and this goes back to some that we used to call you the buyer versus seller frame okay so you got to think when you're going up to girls and you're interacting with women or anyone of the opposite sex if you're for the ladies watching you know if you're like hey you want some of this you want some of this you want some dick to paraphrase Chris Rock again it's meaty it's it's it's quite off-putting okay on the other hand for the buyer frame when you're come from the buyer frame basically you're like all right look I'm securing my own value I know what's up with myself you know I have a good a good ground grounded in my own reality and you know obviously great you're attractive that's that's the price of entry but now what else do you got right and so again you're evaluating them for a potential relationship you're not actually you're not actually trying to sell dick to them okay huge distinction buyer versus seller frame always bear that in mind number three if you like a girl you should choose your words very carefully around her right so by being careful and walking on eggshells what you're gonna do is you prevent yourself from saying anything stupid and screwing up the pickup all right so what's the problem with this well first of all setting up a frame where again the girls of higher value and by doing this you're putting yourself in a very outcome dependent place internally and like it or not you can't help but sub communicate that during the interaction and what's gonna happen is going to show through in countless ways subtle ways through your body language your tone of voice we're gonna in particular highly attuned to this sort of thing and it's bound to trip you up at our SD we typically talk about how being outcome dependent kills attraction and how being having outcome independence builds it and why is that well because the guy who does not care about the outcome likely has other girls all right now again this isn't logical if you think about it why would a girl want some guy who's like fucking all these other girls you know it was like some whole bag right it doesn't really make logical sense but and I was talking with on him ek Tyler about this the other day I kind of what we arrived at is it's the same reason brands work ok if you go into the store and you want to get you know you go to Walgreens and you want to get some ibuprofen what are you gonna do and you're most likely gonna go to the thing you're gonna read for advil you're gonna read for advil why are you going to not reach for the Walgreens generic ibuprofen well again because you're like this you know Abdullah this is good I know this works like I've heard of this I know what it is other people like it it obviously works this I don't know about so basically what it does is it absolves them of having to do research ok it's pre selection conversely if you have a bad brand if your outcome diff you're clearly needing it to work ok you clearly give a fuck about the outcome well then you're not just you're not just Walgreens I'm you're pro fit your your tylenol in the early 80s which I'm probably dating myself but poison okay so anyway that's just that's just one example moreover by carefully planning and pining and all this you you kill off the spontaneity in the interaction and it's that very spontaneity I'm just often the catalyst for that ephemeral thing be chemistry which is of course vital to any any successful pickup so attraction happens fast remember when plotting and planning it's best to just go in boom boom boom we get the switches be out don't shoot yourself in the foot well this methodical ponderous nonsense number four if you want a girl it's best to just be honest for they're about your feelings let's just go up to her and tell her how you feel should respect you for this and she will see the light okay well in a perfect world this would be true unfortunately this isn't a perfect world just the best of all possible worlds and at least according to lightness you know I've you ever done this and had it work you know this like gushing confession of love right I think every guy is tried this out at least once I remember when I did I was actually in junior high school I really like this one girl from my class and so I got her phone number from her friend and I spent an entire morning with the number in my hand by the phone staring at it he like psyching myself up to call her and finally after several hours of this I summoned the courage I dialed the number her parents answered I asked the parents is she home and they put it on the phone and I said something like like Heather hey it's this is Jeff from history class I well I like you do you want to go out with me well guess what happened the chick started laughing said no and hung up and then I had to go to class and like do with the whisperers and stairs right it's pretty terrible but the problem was that with that was that I had done absolutely nothing to build attraction whatsoever I was just like some random dude like trying to like say hey let's go out so this particular kid seed you know that being honest and forthright is the great way to get girls it fails to take this new account the fact of the matter is when you do something like this you come around in state your intent and forces them to make a decision about you immediately okay based on the limited information that they have you now if you've done some groundwork prior to that and build attraction prior to playing your little little honesty card you can work if you haven't well get ready for a little junior high experience of your own now don't get this cross up the idea I'm going direct okay you know we have let's take me and junior high versus say truly all right huge difference in Julian's Sadie's attentions right up front because even Jules and Julian don't often intercept the girl moving through the club you know hold a snatch rub hey like what we like to call an aggressive grab that cannot work there's Mike hey Pam get in front of her a dragger in and be like you're this and that did it today and when she gives them that what the fuck look he'll often reply something like one of his favorite lines is I feel like I'm so incredibly good-looking that I can just do whatever I want so in a second he's created attraction and displayed value and so a lot of the time it works now maybe if I had been a little bit more of a dick in junior high I could have had Heather right c'est la vie number five guys are always chasing after sex and therefore it follows that guys like sex more than girls okay this is absolute rubbish as they say in the United Kingdom so chew on this only females have an organ that assigns totally for sexual pleasure that organ has something like 10,000 times the number of nerve endings of any other region of the human body okay we're talking about the clitoris of course and for those who don't know what that is look the only reason though it seems the guys are more into sex because for guys it's it's more of a commodity for us right think about it even most homely woman in town you know can likely get laid by taking a trip down in her local bar by herself right so basically anyone has plenty of options if she wants to get laid there's no dearth of sex is available for girls okay the thing is she has to be very selective about when and where she has sex and she wasn't constantly screening and these guys out well I'm just gonna end up having sex with fifty thousand guys by the time she's done which doesn't even leave much time for other hobbies now does it so it's this necessary process of screening which has up giving me absolutely false impression that women don't enjoy sex as much as men do make no mistake they like it just as much if not misconception number six people see me doing approaches they'll point this out to their friends and I'll have a good laugh in fact people are always looking around to see if dudes a reproach and girls so they can laugh at them and if I do these approaches people will think less of me well this is just screwed up internal talk at work here look was the thing you got to realize is most people are so self-absorbed they can barely cross the fuckin Street I can hang it by a car what makes you think they're gonna notice you doing approaches alright there's an old saying when you're young you care about what people think about you in middle age you stop caring what people think about you and in old age you realize that nobody was even thinking about you at all so having said that then let's just imagine for a second that some guy does notice you and starts to mock you for the sake of argument why would he do something like that motivations it's like I'm going on it's the guy couldn't do important clothes to save his fucking life and as such envies you even if you get blown out doesn't matter but the balls to approach he doesn't kills him inside and that's what's really going on okay it's that old crabs in a bucket tall poppy gets cut mentality like it says on the side of my van freedom isn't free right that's the goddamn truth now what about what about girls your approach would reject you well I mean dude most the time they're not thinking any less of you providing you've got a base level of competence at the most we're gonna think they're gonna think themselves wow that guy's got some balls sounds like a guy who just goes up you know doesn't give a fuck I'm not up for right now but he seems cool it's not a big deal so this is something you're currently struggling with they're believing instead of why you're thinking like this they're making excuses to not approach so it might be time to reframe things what the fuck do I care what somebody thinks of me who's not taking as much action as me that's something that my old friend Derek told me while back and I really resonated with it so in conclusion you know misconceptions really do abound in this whole like area of study and you know a lot of these misguided strategies that I've outlined here can work sometimes but you know they have a tendency to slot you into the category of the regular guys who do all this stuff you know again the polo shirt wearing rock climber guys who do the stuff most of whom get blown off okay and we don't want statistical roulette they want consistency right well anyway starting get hungry so I think we go up to the taco shop hit the gym and then I'm off to Mardi Gras so hang in there until next time try to give any more misconceptions about the game that might be holding you back and I'll talk to you soon",Tw50gVmgPSg

and so we return and begin again so today marks a little bit of an anniversary for me it was actually thirteen years ago to this day that I first logged into the pickup forums on the old Usenet groups and yeah so it was September 2002 and so I've been officially in the game for thirteen years now and as such I'd like to take this opportunity to reflect a little bit and take a little trip down memory lane if you will 13 years ago I stood up and I said no more okay 13 years ago to the day I decided that I was gonna do whatever it took to change my fucking life and to get this whole dating thing handled now at the time I really didn't know exactly what that was gonna entail but I knew that regardless of the cost I was gonna pay it and see this fucking thing through until the end now I can't say it's been without pain in fact in the beginning was actually excruciating but looking back on the experience today I realize it was all the necessary part of the process so let me digress here for a second one of my close friends is actually a total comic book nerd and he always has been and so I didn't really think that this guy could teach me much about the pickup game and women and all this but the other day I was actually pleasantly surprised he actually turned me on to a graphic novel called the Invisibles by a Duke called Grant Morrison very good very entertaining book very interesting very philosophical bent to it and in one episode of this book the main character is talking about the awakening rituals of the ancient shamans in particular he discusses the ancient Tibetan ritual known as wait for it the chod ritual yes it's actually called the chod ritual although I believe it's you know pronounced differently for Indians watching this can correct me I believe it's like short something like that but anyway after stop laughing I continue to read about this ritual and in this ritual the participants offer up their flesh to be eaten by demons and the purpose is by contemplating their own dismemberment the initiate s-- learn to not identify with their physical body and the purpose of this is basically the same as the Western concept of crossing the abyss or an initiation by crisis basically you go through the worst shit imaginable and you come out of it on the other side sort of above the rest of us plebeians okay and so all over the world the same experience the holy man is taken up by the spirits or the demons who strip him of his flesh and remake his body always introducing to it some alien element like you know a magic stone or a magic bone or some shit and always teach any initiate a secret speech the tantric tongue of the Dakini or the twilight language the language whose words are not represent things but are things so the child practitioners are well aware of the psychological significance of all this the deities that are being evoked during this ritual are these symbolic images of his desires and wishes while the evil spirits quote-unquote are nothing but the projections of the practitioners mind their embodiment of his pain and his fear so offering one's body and dancing on the ego actually represent the means of eliminating discrimination between good and evil discrimination between desire and aversion this is of course the dichotomy that Buddhist thought deems the root of all suffering so the end result is a complete separation of mind and body well of course still being grounded in the real world and this is it as opposed to say receiving you know brief flashes of transcendence like many people will get during meditation sex drugs or whatever so in pick up we too must undergo a similar process when we're learning how to be successful in social interactions and of course in our case the demons are gonna be the neuroses the fears the filters of insecurities inside our own heads that are actually preventing us from expressing ourselves freely so my first year in the game was pretty much entirely spent re-engineering my belief systems and giving myself over to these demons to have my ego basically ripped to shreds you know in all my life I had been deathly afraid of doing cold walk ups on strangers because I had been conditioned to perceive social interaction as something having potentially negative consequences and this of course in turn gave birth to these so-called demons and they took up residence inside my head we're talking about the paranoia a need to impress fear of expressing myself feelings of undeserving this self-monitoring arrogant beliefs that I can't be helped by others stuff like this so that whole first year I was like one of those Tibetan monks right I basically tied myself to a stake called forth the motherfucking demons and watched them crawl up to me look me in the eye and proceed to disembowel my psyche and pulverize it until there was nothing left but a fine red mist suspended in the air or at least that's how it felt as I threw myself into the breach forcing myself to swallow those fears hitting upsets night after night after night after night like a fucking lunatic now did I get blown out yeah you bet over and over and over again and some of the most harsh ways that you could imagine so in many ways it was it was torturous you know a lot of the time I just wanted to give up I just wanted to quit give up on this fantasy of being a player you know just go back to my losery existence watching sitcoms whacking off to salacious internet content but I hung in there and eventually I reached that point where I was in fact rebuilt by this experience I was no longer attached I had no longer attached any emotional significance to rejection I have learned to transcend these petty ego concerns and consequently my game started to shoot up by leaps and bounds why well it was simple because I no longer cared about the outcome I was in turn no longer broadcasting negative and needy sub communications instead I would roll up and I've given off nothing but confident positive vibes and that's the number one rule a game is it not whatever you feel they feel in fact it's one of the most fundamental tenets of the entire fucking game people can feel the energy that you are projecting if you're full of self-doubt full of fear anxiety trepidation they're gonna want to get the fuck away from you if on the other hand you're projecting the simple energy of lectures a fun upbeat outgoing social guy that energy is gonna be infectious and people are in fact drunk to it so yes my first year in the game was a pretty painful process but it was something I had to go through in order to be able to congruently project the attitude of someone who was actually successful in social interactions so after that came my sophomore year in the game so to speak and now I was ready to get down to bidness and sorry making the myth so to speak and it was during this year that I learned the so-called secret language of the Dakini okay and what this meant was actually gaining a deep understanding of how the social matrix functions right a knowledge of the underlying themes switches that spark attraction comprehension of the female psyche and how women respond to different stimuli etc etc etc now when you are privy to this information well yeah it can seem like magic you know when you see a skilled player roll up to a set get the girls fucking shrieking hysterically within a matter of seconds you're like holy shit how the fuck is he doing what is he doing differently than me and you can't see it you know I'm boot camp a lot of the times guys like what are you doing differently than me I go up and they've told me you go up and they think you're the shit and I'm not really saying or doing that much different it seems like magic but again the funny thing is all modern technology was once considered magic right once you understand the mechanisms behind it all it becomes clear and so it was with my second year in the game I was able now to see the subtle little shifts taking place in sets in the interactions and adjust my game accordingly in order to compensate dynamically in field things didn't seem so mind-boggling anymore right it's almost like other people are moving in slow motion because you're not here like micromanaging what's happening every second your mechanics are dialed so that's all on autopilot so now you could focus your attention your CPU processors based on your brain on these subtle emotional shifts and energy shifts that are happening so again for all intents and purposes it looks like people are walking in fucking slow motion right when I walk into club I can feel the game around me right the concepts that that once seemed so fucking advanced to me for example the you know qualifying fractionation shit like that all the stuff seems very facile and very easy to understand on a fundamental level right I was now able to integrate things into my game quite easily while constantly refining and distilling everything else into the most potent material possible so this the sophomore year so to speak this was the year that I started having a real success it was the year I scored my first fucking true blue nine okay it was the year I pulled my first stripper up out the strip club it was the year I had my first threesome in other words things that I had thought were only possible in the fucking movies or the aforementioned salacious Internet content were starting to become all too real and much too true as too-short would say so yeah motherfuckers I've had to fucking pay you don't know how much I've paid but that's the fucking game right and now here I am basically a tenured professor in the game but as I continue on my path I realize there's absolutely no telling what the next lessons are gonna be and I'm sure there's gonna be bold highs and lows but I'm ready to face whatever is waiting for me the point is it's all about the journey and I don't mean the awesome rock man okay featuring Steve Perry so ask yourself what were your journey this has been Jeff E and I'll see you next time  you,Ul1sai-8pbo
hey hey hey it is I your homespun & hackneyed boy Jeffy here today on a sweltering day in San Francisco with my nondenominational carbonated water beverage and today I want to talk to you about the new RSD so what does this mean well I'm beginning a lot of messages lately on various and DMS and so forth from people asking me what's going on with this new direction this mood erection that the company seems to be taking as of late and you know a lot of people are asking me is this done is is pickup over because they've seen toddler make noises about this recently and they've seen some you might have seen some things that indicate that were growing out of pickup and yes as the founders of the company grow and mature I mean I'm 43 years old right now Tyler's actually a 40 years old we really do feel a new mission a new calling if you will to bring our ideas to a broader audience and what that's gonna mean it's gonna require a certain branching out beyond this more narrow subculture that we started it now having said that I want to take this opportunity to assure you that we're always going to be true to our roots we're always going to continue to serve that gaining and relationships niche as we've done so well over the past 16 years but there is so much more to be done in service of the larger movement to nudge the world a bit further away from the brink of absolute insanity now as we do that I interestingly enough most of the ideas that we've espoused for years in in the relationships dating scene these ideas actually dovetail and and synergistically harmonize actually with the broader areas of self nomen so to be honest most long-term fans Varsity they're going to be able to immediately see the application of these new ideas to hard-core pickup believe it or not and that's what I want to give you a glimpse of today as you know in this video I'd like to explore some fundamental paradigms of the new rst  [Music]  before we get into this I'd like to remind you to LIKE and subscribe right now to this video and this channel so you can get the real talk coming at your inbox every single week again this is stuff that I learned in the trenches going out doing pick up seeing countless students transform over the past 16 years again this is real talk not just some quaff dude sitting in a studio or what have you I mean I I also in that but it's also real talk so again if you like that like and subscribe to this channel right now so to get into this whole idea of the the new RSD I want to talk about some absolutely crucial concepts here and the first is this idea of self esteem what is self esteem well self esteem is something that you're born with right like you're like your arms and your legs it's something that is indescribable like like your mojo or your soul you have it as a child until that self-esteem becomes wounded at which point it takes years to find it again and to sort of re remember the self esteem that you had as a child and the self esteem it feeds off of nothing it's self-sustaining now to contrast well then on the other hand we have what we call ego and what's ego ego was a rational construct that we devised as a substitute for self esteem when your actual subsidy has become too wounded to provide confidence anymore so things like striving to gain status things like making money things like being this badass pimp who pulls girls these things allow us to logically tell ourselves I have confidence and this is this is very very different from from that innate self-esteem because again self-esteem is an innate human attribute whereas your ego it's a man-made psychological construct and there's psychological construct it feeds off continual attention it feeds off of accolades and feeds off of good reactions from other people etc etc etc now one might argue that ego is actually a stronger form of confidence than self esteem because ego is based on something rational right it's like oh okay it's logical and it makes sense however if you were to go even deeper and become more you'd realize self-esteem is that innate characteristic and something that you're born with just like again arms or legs so remember with self-esteem there is no logical reason for having it you just have it you just have it because you're born with it it's innate it is inherent to your being so when someone says you know that guy has way too much ego what they're saying is basically that person is leaning on this like logical construct to give himself competence because essentially he's a wounded little child who lacks self-esteem in other words when you hear about a guy with too much ego that guy is coming from a place of weakness not strength now of course it's not a bad thing to have ego right I'm not trying to tell you to become the Buddha here so you know guys who transcend all ego are often kind of these weirdos who live live in a cave or something cross-legged but you know so we're not trying to an ayah late ego it's good to go after things that you want because it improves your own quality of life like I choose to live in San Francisco California of all places like the more the most literally the most expensive place to live in the United States and if I were to move out of here my life would become easier in many ways but I enjoy it a great deal because I like the weather I I like the the food culture I like the way it looks I just enjoy being here right if I wanted to impress like my cool pickup friends I would move to Los Angeles or to Las Vegas right so so there's that but if anything ego should be layered on top of self-esteem it should not be a substitute for self esteem as so many people make it so if somebody pulls the rug out from under you like in terms of like validation or whatever ideally it shouldn't affect you emotionally why because you have that foundation of self esteem in place now as far as you know success in dating is concerned well say you approach someone you got to know that that self is always shining through the self is always coming through and what does that mean that means you know things such as self esteem masculine polarity confidence positivity your outlook like for example I have like a a pretty weird and funny worldview so I have a this kind of slightly ironic character if you will that displays this these things are always coming through to the girl even if you go up and say hi and just have a casual conversation and you know later on as the conversation progresses things like the fact that you have your own tastes and values the fact that you have your own identity and purpose the fact that you have personal boundaries these things will also start to come through so this knowledge that the self is always coming through is perhaps the most intense realization that you will ever have and once you realize this well guess what you realize that you can approach with anything and pretty much say anything and the people that you go up to are gonna dig it why because that self is coming through so you can almost think of it like like psychic powers or something right even though those don't really exist as far as I'm aware this is why I always say that pick up for me it's like lucid dreaming like I can go up and change things with my words because this is internal thing I've tapped into this internal channel of self-esteem that I've tapped into that is grounded and that draws them that draws them in as opposed to ego which has a tendency to give up a kind of competitive vibe so even if your technique is perfect there is a tendency for it to be a little repulsive so it's like whether you got a mansion or a yacht or you know up the cold steel two-handed great sword hanging above your your mantle like I do or you know a 12-inch penis whatever or just even like intelligence or street smarts or this cosmopolitan worldly perspective that the specifics are totally subjective and irrelevant if you've got real self-esteem and you know what that the self is always coming through say it with me the self is always coming through then the girls know that you're the the stabs would second you open your mouth or at least you know after they process it which may take a few sentences you know some should go up and you get the skeptical look who is that guy but very quickly they're gonna be able to determine okay this is an energy that I want around me and as the self comes through and then they realize you're cool right so the day that this epiphany clicks in your head your life will change your life will dramatically change now if you walk up to a girl and and you don't immediately get a like a lot of attention right off the bat well then just like the driver of like a you know say a Formula One racecar a driver who knows the caliber of the car he's driving he's not gonna be afraid when he goes into like a very steep curve why because he has faith in the abilities he knows that the car is gonna grip the track and by way of how it's built and so I could go careening off the track into the stands right so in other words you have this knowledge that the self will show through within a few more sentences even if you again you hit that that curve or whatever whereas the guy who doesn't know what kind of car he's driving he'll freak out he'll try to overcompensate for that and end up again careening off the track so again this analogy the guy the guy who knows what kind of car he's driving he's tapping into self-esteem the guy who doesn't know the capabilities of the car and you know what it's engineered to to accomplish he feels like it needs more logical justification to believe in himself therefore he's tapping into ego okay in other words think of it like this ego is anytime a person doesn't react like exactly as you were expecting what do you do you get these kind of like needy hungry defensive eyes and start like pushing for a reaction right trying to get the reaction trying to crack the set trying to get in and people what happens they feel this and they blow you off or even worse I see this all the time - you blow yourself out just to avoid any sort of contradictory evidence that you're anything other than the the quote-unquote badass player that you believe yourself to be you're like well it could go bad so I better like head that off at the pass by just ejecting because it'd be just called a premature ejaculation right so that's ego and on the other hand self-esteem is where you're totally at ease with any sort of a reaction that you get from the people and once the person you're approaching feels that under reactive polarity coming off of you then they open up right again hence like I just said knowing that in a few more sentences these self will surely start to come through so the core of what's going through your mind it must be the following number one I have self-esteem and I'm not even thinking about any rational reason for it whatsoever right I'm born with this why because it's my soul mojo superpowers and it is God's will yeah this might sound a little bit absurd but literally all the top guys at this stuff have this running through their heads when they're out there and they're sort of hitting on all cylinders secondly I know that the self is always coming through and people will know exactly who I am the second that they listen to me talk third I know and believe that what I have to say is valuable why simply but by virtue of the fact that it's coming from me and I know that what I have to say is interesting why because it's an expression of my personal tastes and people are curious about that right just like if a very attractive woman is talking whatever she says is gonna be interesting why because it comes from her you have that same value number four I don't take ownership of others bad reactions why because I personally spent enough time taking failure as feedback and improving myself that if they react badly it's probably their issue and not mine so by installing these kind of beliefs you're gonna see on head and shoulders above every other person who can't be themselves around others why because ego is ultimately a sign of unhealed wounds unhealed psychic wounds where real self-esteem is a sign of true vitality like back when you were a child you had self-esteem why as we said you're born with it but it was wounded through adolescence and and social conditioning etc etc and therefore could no longer provide that fuel for your confidence so to find that fuel you went ahead and you created an ego in other words you sought out rational reasons for why you should feel competent in order to kind of carry that weight but at this point you are no longer that person you are no longer that person and you are so evolved that everything about you whether you're a physical your self-esteem is stronger and it is no longer so easily wounded so you can re remember that old self-esteem okay you can remember re remember that old self-esteem you have as a child and again be like a big happy kid as you approach people with full expectation of a friendly response now this all sounds kind of kind of funny but it's absolutely true and it's what's called coming into your own now with regard to that feeling that you get when you're having like a really on night or as we have called in the past being in state when you go out and you use game to get people that you approach giggling and giving you attention and you find yourself going into state so to speak what is this this is your ego in a feeding frenzy right your ego is saying mmm this is this feels good these people laughing keep it up keep it coming and this is the equivalent of putting your hands on like two electrical poles and just like letting the current blast through you and that's why going out and hitting that state it's just so addictive and so compelling however confidence has to come from somewhere it's got to come from somewhere and the kind of high that you get from tapping into ego it's kind of like a dirty and erratic high so yes it is a high where you're completely in state but even as you do another approach in the back of your mind you might say to yourself you know maybe I shouldn't do this one because because I might fall back out of state this is what we call having a fear of ground zero and that comes from that egoic tapping into ego now tapping yourself a steam based confidence you get a more stable high a clean and sustainable high right you can feel that you're in the state but it's so much cleaner and there really isn't the slightest concern that you might fall back out of it so to speak now we've actually talked about this in the past we've ever read a book called power versus force this is sort of a similar idea forces ego where you're working the oars on the boat and power is just letting the sail up and letting it carry you like what I'm hitting that that state that comes from self-esteem I just feel like like Jimi Hendrix playing the guitar or something it's not like I'm not even doing it it's like the music is happening through me right the game as it were is happening through me and it's impossible to fall out of that state why because when you hit that you've tapped into something that's inside of you and you've hit that sweet spot and really at the end of the day that's what the new RSD and and really what this game is really all about a deeper exploration of the psychology behind these principles that will ultimately serve you in all areas of your life and if you're someone who is just beginning that journey to become more outgoing more socially intelligent I'd really encourage you to check out my upcoming program charisma

"- What up cats and kittens, Proverbial Boy here, and I'm here today in front of some gold thing. What I wanted to discuss today is another one of these very fundamental questions that I hear all the time. (dubstep music) Just let me set the scene for you. I'll be on boot camp, and I'll be with a client, and I'll tell him, okay go approach that group there. And the guy will turn to me with this look on his face, and he'll be like, but there's a guy there. There's a guy there. I'm like, regardless, go. Go speak to the girl. Because, what's happening? The guy's speculating that, oh, it's the boyfriend, right? This is another thing I see in-game, a lot of speculation is inadmissible. I've talked about this before, you shouldn't be speculating about certain outcomes, or what something might be based on some movie you've been playing in your head. Go up, find out, deal with whatever the situation is after the fact. A lot of the time it's not the boyfriend. The boyfriend is not, like, the default. It's not even the most common thing for a guy to be when you see a guy out with a girl. What are some other things it could be? It could be her roommate, it could be her cousin from out of town, it could be her co-worker, it could be her neighbor, it could be an old friend, it could be a gay friend, right? Sometimes it could be the boyfriend. Sometimes it could be a random person that literally just walked up to her. The point is, you don't know, until you actually go up and see what it actually is. Having said that, there's three broad categories that the guy could fall into, right. When you see a guy there with a girl, there's three broad categories he could fall into. That's number one, it's actually the boyfriend. Number two, it's a friend. And number three, it's a random person that just walked up to her. So what I want to do in this video, is I want to address the, kind of the standard operating procedure for each of those situations if you're out at the club and you step to a mixed set, if you will. Let's say it's the boyfriend, and by the way, caveat emptor here okay, you wanna make sure it's actually the boyfriend. You wanna make sure it's like, she says, yes this is my boyfriend, and it's coming from the horse's mouth, so to speak, and it's not just the guy telling you this. Because, guess what, guys will lie. I do this all the time, when I'm with someone like, yeah it's my girlfriend. Where do you think I learned that? I learned that from dudes who did it to me back in the day. So, the thing is, you wanna get it, again, from the horse's mouth, meaning what? You wanna ensure that it's actually the case. Now how are you gonna find this out? If the girl tells you and she's, like, hugging on him and she's very affectionate towards him, then it's most likely the boyfriend. If it's not, and she's actually lying, what does that tell you? Well, you probably done screwed up, and she just wants you to get the fuck away regardless. So, either way, if the girl tells you that, it's a done deal. Like assume that it actually is, at that point, okay? So, having said that, what do you do if you go up to a set and there's like, hey it's my, we're boyfriend and girlfriend. Now, look, I'm not there to cause some sort of problem in the club, I'm not there to cause like a social problem. So what I'll do is first I'll start giving him a little shit, like give him a little good-natured ribbing, and I'll typically say something along the lines of, like, so, oh cool, so you're together, oh awesome. So, why are you here? And they're like, well, what? Like yeah like why are you here tonight? They're like, oh, we're out having fun. Like, no, no this is for single people. You have forfeited your right to have fun. And they're like excuse me? Right, I'm like, no, no, again, you forfeited your right to have fun, because let's face it, you and I both know, that y'all gotta wake up early in the morning to go to the fucking farmer's market to pick up some seasonal vegetables for your little dinner party, your little Top Chef-themed dinner party where you like cook and judge each other's shit with snarky commentary. Oh, what happens after the dinner? Perhaps, um, some board games? Maybe some, uh, Cards Against Humanity? Some What Do You Meme? Maybe some, uh, Settlers of Catan, super-fun board game about cooperation and sharing. Yeah, I know all about it I collect wood early, I try to get the longest road, etc. So, again, when I first start launching into it, like, you're not supposed to be here, you see him kind of like puffing up and getting angry. Then as it becomes increasingly ridiculous, then they're like, okay, this guy's just fucking around. Then I'll like, maybe I'll chit-chat them for a little bit after that, I'll be like, yeah cool man, so yeah, so where you guys from? Oh sick, yeah, you know, I had a friend from there. You ever go to this place, duh duh duh duh? Oh cool, well hey, great to meet you guys, see you around, have a great night. And again, why do I do that? Because I'm not viewing it as, the club, as only a set of like, a group of like two and three-sets, I'm also looking at the larger ecology, okay. I believe Mystery back in the day, he said, ""Look at the club as though it\'s a hundred-set."" Right, so, even though, I didn't get the girl, or whatever, later in the night, if I'm with another girl, and I walk by them, they might be like, oh look, it's that dude, hey what's up man? I mean they might even buy you a drink. Maybe the guy will have a business opportunity for you. There's a lot of things that would behoove you not to be like, well fuck you, I'm gonna steal your girl, right? You know, it's kind of funny, with that ribbing, it brings to mind another phrase I often use, like when I'm in Las Vegas, they're like, oh, so you guys are together, right? And they're like, yeah. I'm like, oh, that's funny, taking your significant other to Vegas, huh? That's a bold choice. And then they're like, what? I'm like, well, you know, I once heard someone say that taking your significant other to Vegas is like bringing a warm beer to a bar where they serve free, cold beer. And everyone's just like, there with their cold beer, like, having the time of their life, like throwing it around, spilling it, I mean it's free, who cares? And you've just gotta sit there and pretend that you just love your lukewarm beer. Right, and usually when I say this, the girls start laughing, and the guy's like, huh. 'Cause they know it's fucking true. I'm like, you know it's true, bitch. Bottom line, I'm not trying to cause a problem, I'm trying to, like, contribute to the ecology, and just the upward spiral of the night. Now, again, I used to AMOG these guys and stuff like that and I think a lot of that, when we first started doing this, was like, you know to tool the guy. I think a lot of that was born from us starting out as like those nerds that got tooled by the jock in high school, so it's like revenge for high school. I think that's, a lot of the time, why we, we cultivated that, but, again, it's pointless. It's absolutely pointless to do that. Now, on the other hand, let's say you do want to steal. Well, again, maybe you're a bit of a devious fellow, you actually do want to fucking steal her. So what you would do in that case, you know, honestly, I would either pretend I'm gay, and then, or B, I would wait until the dude's attention is away, and then, maybe I could have my friend come and like, get their attention, so his attention's diverted, after the fact, and I'd just be like, yo, give me your number on the down-low. Like, and do it on the DL, and then try to call her later in the week, and hook up with her then. So that's for number one, is the boyfriend. But what about number two? What about number two? You gotta take a massive shit in the club. What do you do? (chuckles to self) What about the second category? Which is, it's an actual friend. Okay, it's their male friend that they know. So, if that's the case, what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna treat him like a fat girl. So, in other words, I'm going to fuck him. (chuckles to self) Ba dum tss. No, actually, what I'm going to do, is I'm gonna treat him as literally though he was, like, a fat female friend, or an unattractive female friend. I mean, you know, big can be beautiful, I get it, but like you're not attracted to the friend, it's the same thing, you're not trying to fuck this dude, you're not trying to fuck her friend, either, so you're gonna treat these people the same. So you're not going to ignore them, because that's gonna say what? This guy has poor social intelligence, he's not even treating me like a human being, he's got blinders on the hot girl, or, just again, tooling out the friend. But you don't wanna over-engage them, either, because if you over-engage them, what could happen? The girl just leaves, and now you're there bro-ing it up with a dude. This is a common mistake, I see new, newer guys on boot camp commit. They start like bro-ing it up with the dude, and then the girl that they were talking to leaves. So, again, you don't want to bro it up, but you do wanna give him a couple little quips here and there, you wanna give him maybe 10% of the attention, at least at the beginning. Get his tacit approval to be there, so he thinks, okay this guy's cool, whatever, and then, again, you can continue on with your girl. And then, again, occasionally, throw a couple little pebbles at him so he feels included, and he's not gonna be like, this guy's tooling me out. I'm gonna take the girl and leave. Now ideally, you can even get, like, your wing man to maybe like chat it up with him a bit, to give you an opportunity to isolate your girl. Right? However, I would say this, even with the male friend, you may wanna actually get the number, the Insta, and try to follow it up later. I mean obviously, try to pull, but just bear in mind, with that male friend there, a lot of the times, she's gonna be a lot less inclined to actually go with you. 'Cause think about it, if she's out with a female friend, it's one thing. You know, even if she leaves with a dude, they'll be like, she might get some like gentle, you know, joking about it, like, oh hey how was it last night? Right, like, got that D girl, haha, right? But again, when I have female friends, and I see how these girls talk amongst each other, and they're very open about sex. I mean, like, especially in today's day and age, it's not gonna be like, morality shaming, they're probably gonna be happy that she pulled. However, with the guy, if it's a male friend, he might be a little bit more judgmental, okay? 'Cause maybe he harbors certain old-fashioned, socially-conditioned ways of thinking about this stuff, or, just as likely, he's been in love with her for like two years, as well. You know, he's like, uh, I've been in love with Betty for two years, and now this cretin comes and takes her away from me, meh, right? So he might try to salt your game a little bit, so just bear that in mind, okay? We've had what if it's the actual boyfriend, what if it's the actual, some sort of friend, like, platonic friend, and then last but not least, what happens if it is the Rando Commando, okay? Now here's the thing, if it's the Rando Commando, I'm gonna basically completely fucking ignore this guy. And I know, if you've been to my hot seat, you might have seen different videos where I'm in a set, with a mixed set, and the guy's just some rando, I'm not giving this guy, like, air. Like, as a guy who's, just a man in general, I guess, but more importantly, when you're doing cold-approach pickup and you're out there, you don't wanna give oxygen to anything that does not help you. Again, if the girl's talking shit, like give you some shit test, I'm not gonna argue with it logically, I'm gonna say some gibberish, maybe, like, some self-deprecation, and then just plow it under. Right, again, if somebody's saying that, like, you're an idiot duh duh duh duh. Again, this isn't saying that, like, I don't take the criticism of close friends or people that I respect, like I don't take that into account. I'm just saying randoms out in the club, whose opinion means literally nothing to me, I'm just not gonna even give that shit oxygen, right? So, the same kind of thing applies here. If it's like Rando Commando, why am I even gonna try to fucking engage this guy, it's pointless. All I wanna do is keep the girl's attention on me. Like I said earlier, back in the day, when these guys would come in, we developed all these funny quips and strategies like, hey man, nice shirt, I had one just like that in high school. Bet you get pussy with that, ha ha ha. Love this guy. All that kind of like AMOG stuff back in the day. Like I said, I think a lot of that came from like a desire to get like revenge on the guys that got the girls when we didn't when we were fucking nerds revenge of the nerds. Right now it is, like, I'd rather not even be fucked, like why bother when I don't have to? Now, let's face it, am I able, like if I chose to go down that verbal tooling route, am I able to tool those dudes out with consistency? Yeah, yeah, I really, I actually am quite good at it. You know, my verbal acuity at this point, after 15 years of doing this shit, and like going out and meeting people every single night, almost, has been honed to the point where I've heard everything that they're going to say. I've heard every conceivable insult. I've heard every angle that they could try to come at me, and I have like five responses for all of those. So yes, I'm going to probably verbally destroy him. And when, and he's gonna slink away in shame, and be tooled and humiliated, and everyone's gonna think he's a joke, essentially. But, and it's funny too, 'cause I, in instances when I have done that, you can kind of see it happen. The guy comes up, maybe he thinks I'm an easy target, maybe he's just a bully, and he's like, hur dur dur, blah blah blah. And I'm like, oh yeah, that's funny dude, duh duh duh duh. And they're like, oh, boom, tooled. It's like (gun firing) tooled. And then he's like, uh wha duh duh, try something else, I'm like, ha ha, buh duh buh duh boom! And he's like, and you can see the, you can see it happen in his eyes, like he's like, you can see kind of the gears going in his mind, like, if I continue to engage with this guy, verbally, like this, spar, I'm going to look quite foolish. So I had better, like, kind of like lay back and just chill for a second, right? I'm not gonna lie, that can be incredibly gratifying, when you see that happen, but again, I don't want to exert that much energy, it's pointless. And here's the thing, even if 90 to 95% of the time I am gonna be better than the guy, verbally, 5 to 10% of the time, I'm not. Like it's rare, but it does happen. I'm not here thinking like, I'm the best guy, the most witticism fellow in the universe. Like, there's guys who are fucking smart and sharp and witty and funny, and you know, they're out there, so it's like why even give them the opportunity? Why even crack the door open enough? Like anything I say to that guy is essentially giving him a foothold, a potential foothold, to come back at me, and again get back in there. So, I think the most expedient way to go about it, when it is the Rando Commando, is just get the girl's attention on you, and then maintain that and just ignore him until he's tooled out. A lot of the time you'll see that if you go in and it turns out it's some rando, and by the way, until I can determine it's a rando, I'm going to assume it's a rando, until she says oh, this is my buddy, blah blah blah. Or, this is my boyfriend, or whatever, I'm just gonna assume it's a fucking rando until proven otherwise. It's funny, if you go in like this, and you're just like, hey, blah blah blah blah blah, a lot of times these guys will just fly away like bowling pins, like (exploding) and you just see them like fly to the winds, it's like the funniest shit, right? Again, the law of conservation of energy really comes into play. Don't do more than you need to get to the next step. And now, what if, you're not like me, or Julian, or Max, or whoever? You're not that good, you're kind of just starting out, and you really don't have that verbal acuity, you really don't have that million-dollar mouthpiece, if you will, that ability to have a compelling patter and banter, if you will, that's gonna keep attention on you, what would you do in that case? Like what if you, in other words, were to encounter me, for example, and I come into your set? What do you do? The girl's just like looking at me, she's like, oh who's this motherfucker? And her attention is on me. How would you deal with me? Well the answer is quite simple, you're going to physically, 'cause you can't beat me verbally, so you gotta physically remove her from me. Okay, and there's a couple ways to do that. Some guys like to pick the girl up and carry them away, like, yay fun, and carry them away. What I'll like to do, a lot of the time, is I'll just like grab her hand and be like, hey, come, and I got this from Julian, I'll be like, hey, come meet my friend, come meet my friend. And I'll just drag her over to some other random girl, and I'll be like, this is my sister, this is my girlfriend. Anyway, bam, and just right back onto the girl. 'Cause now I'm like 20 feet away from the guy. And, the thing is, this might not always work, but it's better than nothing, if you can't get her attention back. The guy could follow, right? Then this puts him in kind of like a bad position, 'cause now he's like the follow guy, but sometimes they do anyway, right? And, again, then you might have to get into this sort of tug-of-war scenario, where he gets her attention back, you get her attention back, and then it really is kind of like an attrition thing, it's like, who is willing to go deepest, and who is willing to, who's gonna be the most patient man to win the game? And a lot of times that's what it is. A lot of times it boils down to who's gonna be, you know, the more patient guy who's just gonna stick in there longer, and be more persistent. Right, be more tenacious. I remember one time, I had a boot camp, and we were in, like, a hotel lobby here in San Francisco, and the student was on some couch with this girl. And he was chatting her up, the banter was great, the flirtation, they were like kissing and stuff like that, and it seemed really on, but then there was this guy she had kind of been talking to before. So the student's here on the couch, girl's, student's here, girl's here, but then on the arm of the couch, this guy is just sitting there. And he's not really saying anything, he's just kind of creeping. And I'm like, dude, this guy looks creepy as shit, right? At the end of the night, it was time to pull, so he comes to me, and it's like, last call, everyone's kind of starting to mill about, the lights are up, so he comes to me real quick, he's like, what do I do now, Jeff? I'm like, okay, here's what you're gonna do, take her to the diner up the street, just say, hey let's go get something to eat, and then just grab her and just start walking. By the time, in the time it took me to do that, I look over, and that creeper dude has just taken her hand and he's walking off. And like, we go out, and they get into a cab and just fuck off together. And I'm like, really, that fucking guy? 'Cause he was, again, the guy that stuck in there, and was more persistent about it. You know what I'm saying? So, again, sometimes you're gonna have that tug-of-war, and you gotta decide how long you wanna actually stick in there, right? And another thing, too, is sometimes it won't work when you're trying to pull her away. I remember, one time I was in Vegas, and these guys, they did this, like, concerted move to like tool me out, and I was like, fuck this. I go to get her back, and I'm like hey come meet my friend, and I go to pull her and she won't come, she's like, stop pulling me! I'm like, no, and then I like sneak away, and the guys are like, laughing and shit, it's like, motherfuckers. (chuckles to self) So again, it won't always work, nothing in game is 100% certain, remember, that's why it's called pickup art, okay? There's a certain artistry to it, that certain element of randomness that makes the game beautiful, in my opinion. But, again, those are best practices and, kind of the best strategies to employ for those three types of guy that are in the mixed set. Anyway, hope you enjoyed this video, this has been Jeffy at the golden times in the tulip realm, and I'll see you next time. And now it is time, to dance. I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot hook the set-set-set-set, 80% of the time, this is the problem. (dubstep music) Hey! Hey freeze motherfucker! Hey good evening. But the way he said it, it lacked that conviction, he was like, you're h-h-hot, you know, it was this wavering tonality in the voice. - This is the root of the mouth, right here. - Okay. - Not just being loud, but being clear. (dubstep music) - Ahhhhh - That's the touchdown, right there. - It's very imperative, not just on the level of getting attraction from the girl, to learn this stuff, but on the level of long-term health for your voice, you're gonna be able to go out and project. I'm her new roommate now, you're evicted. I'd love to introduce you to my family. (glass shattering)",WSTHapA5gMA
yeah any of the main to like notice hmm how do you give them made me no girls I can't understand what you're saying maybe no gir oh um what does that mean give me an example my mind every girl's a fucking maybe no girl everyone is a maybe no girl again if you're only looking for like the low-hanging fruit that when you go up and they're like oh my god you're the shit let's suck your dick like that that you're gonna have a difficult road to hoe son you know I mean so again every girl yet you go up to is gonna be fuckin skeptical how do you do it number one communicate non neediness how do you do that you don't need it to work that's the biggest thing so many guys they go up and they could tell they just need it to work they you're thinking I hope it works I hope she stays and keeps talking to me I hope it's a nice time when I go in I'm hoping it's a nice time I'm there to wreck shit I'm in there to ruin shit that's my whole in not ruined shit but like more mischievious you know nothing like ruin she like ruin her credit fuckin make her get it you know Salmonella or something like no I rub like raw chicken on her face like no I'm I'm there to like mischievious Lee fuck around you know I'm like a trickster I'm like fuckin Loki or some shit right I'm not there to like make sure every I have a nice time and everybody likes me so that's a big one just by virtue of the fact that going up now the thing is what I say outlandish things note I'm not saying then this is another thing guys hear this and they're like we'll I guess we'll just go out and speed us outlandish guy and say all this wacky shit for the sake of being wacky if you're doing that then again the pendulum that's another crutch in and of itself and makin sense you're doing that a lot of the time too but when I'm going up again I'm just my criteria for what I say is does it amuse me you know what I mean that's one like are you one of these Mexicans Donald Trump one is about again that could have a very poor reaction she could have a very poor reaction to that so if you don't like it what can I say so in my mind I'm not going through the club looking you know trying to make people like me I'm going through the club and I'm trying I'm doing my approaches to find the girls I have chemistry with now interestingly enough the better you get a game the more people seem to have chemistry with you right because again that authenticity when people can sense you're presenting yourself authentically generally people want to be around that because a lot of people do feel stifled to present themselves authentically in social situations so if they're like wow this guy is really free and unstyled maybe I could feel like that if I was around him you know I mean so it's a good feeling it's like the feeling of bringing fun to people not trying to weasel your way into other people's party but just like expressing yourself bringing fun if you don't like it okay have a great night whatever you know very rarely am I going to say some butthurt bullshit even if the chicks a fucking total B word you know I'm not it's not worth my time anymore right I'm just gonna man move on in fact probably won't say anything please I'm an ignored it's like what I don't even in mid-sentence or something man fuck off now there's of course a difference between like challenging you know that sort of a little touch of Antep antagonistic flirtation can be good you know what I mean but note a little of that shit goes a long way I'll let you don't want to get you don't want to like it's easy for like you to do too much of that and then it like turns it balloons up and kind of goes pear-shaped and turns into this like full-blown fucking like antagonistic war which kind of sucks but but again bottom line I just go up i express myself in number one my criteria for success is did I approach did I express myself as opposed trying to weasel my way into their party and number three did I communicate man to woman intent if I did all three of those things mind you there's also certain mechanical nuts and bolts things you need to bear in mind as well like did I ignore the peer group like was I in like a high traffic area where getting fucked and bumped I like go up and like talk open or right when they're about to conduct a transaction with the bartender you know there are nuts and bolts things but generally I know my nuts and bolts shit is on is on is on lock so in my mind a successful approach consists of this did I approach was I'm and a woman did I self amuse no I let it go yeah Superman to dawn of Justice I dropped down at college I don't know I went to college man and it was like summer camp with fucking drugs dude like I didn't see the point but basically you treated like a social circle game you know you probably don't want to be fucking against spam approaching on your fucking campus because that's how you getting you get a reputation get in trouble it's it's a bit different but I would also say and again I don't I don't want to speak too much to this because I don't really know much about it but I would say this also conversely don't use that as an excuse well no I can't approach cuz I don't want to be the thing again looking for shades of gray you know that the new guy the new RC structure guy the Luke the fat guy he uh he has a lot of good stuff on social circle thank you my name is drawn from Milwaukee's small city a little bit of the noise over here I've heard of it I've heard of Milwaukee so my question is I have a mentor right out as a successful mindset panel and he's also a filmmaker I we made and I thought that's what I wanted to do but what I noticed is that every time that I Drive a little bit out of pickup I keep getting these increasing calls to come back to it and then when I get into an interaction with a girl and are not successful yet this pick of things even a sit by saying hi to a girl and having a 15 minute conversation like that I can speak for night because I'm so fucking excited about this and about of things that I'm learning and so I was just wondering intern internship what that was like a really convoluted way to get to say how can I get a fucking internship okay so by the way when you guys are asking questions everyone's here you're not the only person in this entire room so try to ask questions that you think are going to benefit other people in the room right again and that's a big thing with with pickup you want it you don't want to be self-centered you want to be sure that you're sharing value and that everyone in the interaction is getting value right so okay how do you get a fucking internship I don't fucking know honestly that's not my department I just fucking work here dude like but what I think it's like some does anyone know that somebody in here although I guess you what what yeah there's like there's like a page you can go on apply online and then they'll email you and shit like that right and so yeah there is like a channel to do that and by the way it sounds like you're very enthusiastic about that that's great and that's going to serve you very well going forward because you are going to have ups and downs man you know you're gonna have yeah you're gonna have times where like and I recall this distinctly I know times where I would go out and do it like I said like when I got into pickup I started when I was like 26 how old are you know so you're pretty early you know I mean it's just not that early but you know good enough always by the way there might be some old fucks in here to start now you know I'm saying I'm 40 and this year has been the best year of my life well I'm not 40 yet I always say succeed I would I can't wait obviously I can't wait but you know this 39s isn't that crazy the best year of my fucking life in terms of like my I'm arguably the best shape I've ever been in the best pickup I've it my games at its fuckin peak you know and I but the thing is like I said going into this summer I had misgivings about my ability to get back into it maybe I'm too old did it do that you know I mean and I'm like I'm the I'm on the fucking red dragon girls half my age into a fucking van that looks like a murder van you know and so it blew my mind so again if you're old if there's nowhere to go but up you can do this to your dick falls off as long as you're on your path so again be I've had times where I have also several months right and get lena Magoo maybe I lost mojo I'm done so but as you encounter those things try to to not look at the peaks and valleys but kind of try to wrap your head around the big picture yes how did you go about like shooting the shit knowing what to say when you started out oh well okay I didn't I didn't know what the fuck to say no no no peace you know like yeah okay ex-players or being like well it works they know again you're coming for them wrong that's the that's the reason that you're having difficulty is because you're concerned about whether they like it you understand the lot I've got a lot of new guys that come up like I run out of things to say I run out of things to say the root cause of running out of things to say isn't wanting it to work like I need to impress like oh it better be cool I hope it's good I hope it's funny so the girl likes it if you have that mentality it's it's going to be fail City and furthermore you're not you're going to be stifled you're not gonna be able to accomplish it to say because you're putting too much of a filter on it okay and to be like able to be witty in the moment there can be no filter so again the classic thing I was respond to this is imagine you're hanging out with your close friends do you run out of things to say when you're hanging out with your close friends no why because you don't give a fuck with these idiots think you know I mean you're like dude they already they've already accepted you so consequently you're able to be very free and come up with like hilarious jokes you know you're just crack and sitting eating food or whatever like but look like hahaha right like the other day I told evil Jimmy I was like motherfucker you got the you got the fucking clap so much it's called applause and he's like more like standing ovations bitch but all right I guess we're just like sitting around shooting the shit and so it's like we come up with like witticisms like that you know and because we don't care so when you're able so again I'd say this what I learned was this cuz again when I first went up I was like Oh what do you say and I used routines and stuff it's kind of a training wheels crutch in the beginning like elaborate routines and the thing is dude look I've always been very good at rote memorization so those routines they were a bit of a good crowd for me in the beginning but it's like dude I could give you five hours of fucking routines but a certain point they're going to run out and then you're going to be like what it's like this isn't the same guy that was all witty for five hours you know up until this point like what the hell so for me I came to that realization it's not an adding on of lines some adding on of witticisms it's a letting go right it's a letting go so it's kind of like this when I have a student it's almost like he's like hanging on to this like branch over a fucking chasm for dear life like oh I want it to be good I wanted to be good and then us the instructors were like Shh we're like flying around him like share absorb an you can fly too you can fly too he's like no if I let go I'm clearly going to plummet to my grisly death and we're like stepping on his hands and shit there's a god oh and then finally like peeling his fingers off but again we can we could push him but he's got to be the one to let go and then finally if he finally lets go it's like whoa oh shit they were right we and then he starts having fun too but it often takes a lot a lot of time for them to get to that point because look at the end of the day the bar is pretty low for how good what you say has to be it just kind of in my mind the bar for how good what you say has to be it's like it needs to kind of make sense in English you know or whatever the fuck it is you're saying you don't you don't need to be like the comedy stylings of Chris Rock or Bill Cosby for that matter the cat doesn't need to be the Pharmaceutical stylings of Bill Cosby or like Noam Chomsky or so shit it just needs to be good enough good enough is good enough and then the but then the statements of intent are what are what bring the you know take it from this friend to France a man to woman level right okay yeah right here you guys  watch a lot i watch a lot of TV literally i actually watched a lot of TV i watch a lot of like comedians comedy shows and it'll teach you how to uh structure jokes you know how to structure it for like the punchline is funny like with the timing the rhythm like what makes something funny you know it's usually surprised like to normal things then a surprise you know there's a lot of there's like this stuff has all been sussed out by smart people you know so there's that that's one thing and then the second big thing is this becoming comfortable being the center of attention like I know dude you see me up here you're like oh this guy's a good speaker you know you're not seeing the fucking 13 years I've been doing this you know I mean this probably the fucking like seven hundred and fiftieth time I've done this an event like of this nature you know and furthermore I also like I was always doing a shit that would like put me in the spotlight cuz let's face it when you approach the girls like a group of strangers they're gonna they're like what is this what do you got to say what the fuck you got to say who are you what do you want right you're trying to sell me something what is this shit so their eyes are on you so you're like ooh if you're not accustomed to having attention put on you yeah it could be a bit just quieting but secondly sorry but I'm trying to do that less and less but you know sometimes but um but anyway life so I put myself in situations like I've taken stand up stand up workshops I've taken improv workshops I highly I would highly recommend you guys you know this is like the birthplace of fucking improv right like Second City or whatever so I you know from what I understand you know anything that you can do that puts you you know even like Toastmasters or any crap like that I said motivational videos you talked about all like all day whatever like what are your top habits I went the most important Amazon oh okay um most important happens to have hemp sorry Pam pimp pimp it uh dude I mean I look I wouldn't say there's certain things like every single day I'd see there's like things like like I have a schedule you know what I mean so a lot of guys think that you know RSD boot camp instructor or like what they do they pimp it on the weekends and then during the week there's it's like this Carnival of sexual abundance it's like no dude it's basically a nightmare um we go home and it's like you know what I do I sit in front of a computer and edit videos for fucking 16 hours a day and then like answer emails again our call with the fucking web dev team and shit like dude it's like an incessant like writing a fucking copy and edit it out of that right so you ever heard that phrase like start your own business you could be your own boss you get to choose your own hours any 16 hours a day you want right so again it's not all fits all super cool but but again like I have like I start work I wake up usually around noon because my sleep schedules boot camp dictates that so and then all like run errands during the day I always go to the gym that's like number one you know you got to do that even if you don't fucking feel like it and then I dig around run errands around town and then I start work at 10:00 p.m. and I work from 10:00 to 4:00 and then go straight to bed right so that's like my day so it's pretty structured but I'd say again like back when I was going out learning pick up the thing you do every day was go the fuck out and that's the biggest thing you see I saw I said in that trailer I like get out of the fucking house that is truly in my mind the biggest thing you can fucking do is get out of the mother fucking house because so many eyes what they do is they they small chunk the process of going out in their mind in their mind it's not like go out it's like I have to take a shower I'm gonna have to comb my hair I'm gonna have to you know apply my accoutrement I'm gonna have to put my shoes on tie my shoes I got to go out to the car start the car won't car drive out find parking walk to the thing hope I get in but like no it's just go outside you're mister just go outside that's it once you go to the fucking door give it like you why the fuck didn't I do this before like a lot of times like the same with the gym like even if I don't want to go to the fucking gym you know what I say to myself I'll be like look just go down there do a pussy workout do like an abbreviated pussy ass workout and then leave but what happens usually when you get there you're like well I'm fuck it here I might as well do the whole shit you know it's the same thing with the with the club like you'd be like you know I'm not really feeling it tonight maybe I got to wake up early done it up but you know what I'm just gonna go down there I'll do a couple approaches then I'll fucking leave it's fine don't pressure yourself just say just go and then once you get there you'll start having fun typically and you'll be like well fuck it I guess I'll stay the whole fuckin time then maybe even get laid right so that's a huge thing is just again just getting outside the house the second thing is this and I said this again in that in that trailer it's like be audacious be fuckin audacious wear some fucking stupid head and it'll be like why are you wearing this fucking thing what is this I'm like well I'm an extreme athlete and you know it's to keep sweat out of my eyes at any moment I could erupt into an extreme athletic endeavor and you know that the kind of shit I'm doing man it's like if you get sweaty erisa no moments in attention could result in catastrophic injury it's like what the fuck like again I just owned it and we we go out we got all kinds of ridiculous crap will put our fake mustaches we'll be like throwing shit around acting a fool this shit like showing up on a date like my minds like what can I do that's more ridiculous what could I do is more ridiculous because wait for me I get pretty bored you see the same thing with Julian this crazy shit that he says to girls it's for self-amusement purposes like be audacious take refuge in audacity oh yeah right here I'm from for your thoughts about Caleb are yeah I wouldn't do it at all that's fucking bad idea motherfucker a bad idea motherfucker again are you in such scarcity that you really got to do that like really hot girls were everywhere that's it that's like very I don't like that shit I don't like guys who like a good even work we've got a game we like like dude it's like there's hot girls are abundant they're everywhere that's what your mentality and unless you just don't give a fuck about your job I mean I've been fired from every job I've ever fucking had okay from the first one I ever had I worked at Chuck E Cheese I was in the rat costume because I was a midget and you know tall people would scare the kids and the kids were a little fucking out dude they'd kick you in the balls their parents would laugh was it kicking the balls I think it's funny they tried to tear your head off they'd tear your head off that's like the biggest failure you can have I used to take LSD I'd go in the suit and I'd be like they just see like this they see like this happy time Chucky time and then underneath it's like this grinning lunatic with like dinner plates per fucking good and then like the manager calls me anything he's like come here I got to talk to you Mike aw shit busted you feel like I saw you out there today man fucking great stuff bro like you you're you were really enjoying yourself you're dancing with the kids having a ball like more of that more of that I was like oh okay,WW1FvN9Hx4M
it's a spectator culture it's like this ties in with all things including successful women for example how many guys in here would like to have a harem of barrels of light let's say 30 girls and you can fuck it in either time just right most able to say yes but the reality is most guys could not handle that they couldn't handle it the reason most guys couldn't handle it is because their own like success barriers because the socially the homeostasis is a powerful thing you want things to stay the same right your body wants to say the same that's why it's difficult to make like physiological changes even through my diaphragm that go your job you don't wanna see additional responsibility stuff like that it's the same thing with this socially people don't want to change just think what would your friends say I know when I first started going through this my friends like what the fuck are you doing you know be trying to do something play or something with this is just fucking weird man this shit is weird you'd like to meet approaches all this shit's fucked because of course I'm telling them all about it I'm so excited about it you know it's like some new thing and then they're like talking shit you know you're trying to be a player what's another example of this like a guy wins the lottery right he was a lottery a lot of times it's fine and you know some some cases you look at you're down the road he has local the hole shut up fucking hookers blow he's probably worse off than he was before like maybe some shadows or something answer here lawsuit penny why does a cannot fucking handle it and you know you know the dramatic increase in wealth without having to work for it and that's why I'm tired you like that thanks a lot I because what does that teach it teaches that success is from luck and it's not the hard work okay that's classic fucking spectator ISM you know the spectator culture why are you guys like look like a lot of time to these guys that get into this and will gravitate towards like the lines and stuff like that you know the route for routine based type of stuff why is that instant gratification yeah that's like it allows them to surpass the success barriers that they have their one hand why because if the rejection it's not a rejection of that sort of checks from a lot it was technically not a rejection of them look here's a fucking revolutionary thought girls can like you for you ha imagine that okay and you know why look man he talked about it like girls aren't these like social monsters that know everything about this shit there's people like you and I it's a bit tits they want something that we have you know that's called go on okay girls blob dong what's for dear dumb freshly stocked pot inside of balls for dessert stuffed vagina  freshly sub Scott just come up with a bed yeah sign up with a sign that's hope I did all this shit I got to where I need this fight starting out as a shy kid who couldn't even like look people in the eye you know now but back in the day I had to fuck it really chick with and start somewhere you know I didn't start out with your ability to fuck all these girls in this short amount of time I didn't start with the ability for those who read my book like fucking entire girls social circle just to piss her off okay this is somehow be cultivated over time how did I do then how do I start well progressive desensitization into something I know we have her alive but basically what it was like again I was a kid would you stand that I go to the bar I go with my friends all my friend went for the Alpha and then we all go to the bar together yeah and then we'd like to split off they'd be talking to girls I got my pull this goes over there and then I'm like this you know like and then I'd be like you know what I'm just gonna go home and I just like slip out without the top without even telling anyone they probably gave the fucking notice so what I had to do again I took it a step the time first cycle just go out and practice of looking people in the eye on the street like that is literally where I started and then I would like saying hi to people on the street playing 100 people on the street hi hi hi hi hi some who passed by somewhat respond back someone stopped and talked to me anyway I'm still here I'm not vaporized you know and so then I started having conversations then I started making the conversation then I started interacting to be rejecting more of my personality into it then physically escalating any phone numbers that going on dates then getting laid then pulling threesomes then pumping you know this in this map you know my fucking gold is now have sex on the moon  you,WuM62ia8-k8
"yo yo yo what up this is your proverbial boy Jeffy and I'm here today in Santa Monica California with my good friends Julien Blanc and Owen cook and today I want to talk a little bit about the idea that some people ever resentment that they have to put forth effort in games and people feel resentment towards the concept of having to give in order to get something now the reason I'm down here in Super Bowl Sunday I really have a little interest in such matters however I did come to attend this phenomenal party hosted by Owens good friends my homeboy a Big Mike was throwing a party and a lot of my friends want to get in the party and this would be a Super Bowl party and he's probably off about a million dollars on this party so you don't by far the best party in town and a lot of people that I would invite kept hitting me back saying I want 2 plus 1 plus 2 Plus 3 plus 4 plus 5 plus 6 plus fucking 19 million and they keep saying get in my plus 1 getting my plus 1 now this party is hands-down the most pretentious upscale party you know probably in the country for the Superbowl maybe in the world for the smackle entertainment what's like a million for 500 people yeah so my crew grande ahead so the biggest feedback that I got when people could bring their plus-one they're stunned it they couldn't wroclaw swashbuckle I it was they were probably like angry physically angry yes physically and even invited to a party where it's basically like you know a 1200 or 1300 gift by the time of what it would cost to put on that party just between all these citywide permits the you know everything they're like the top food that's being given away you know you can it's got to view the whole city on every side of it and this is just a wonderful gift you're being offered but you can't handle it you can't bring your plus one because it can't come by yourself and you're pissed now what was funny about this to me was that every single response that I got was look I don't know about this Hollywood shit okay I'm a real person I'm real I'm just an authentic person I don't like this Hollywood pretentious shit now the point that I would make is this if I invited most the same people to go to say Barney's Beanery or to Buffalo but they don't want to go right they don't want to go so the real people like yo you can come with me you can bring your plus sticks to Buffalo Wild Wings we're good to go you could get me some wings where you get some some brewskis you know and be in with the people and there's nothing stopping you from doing that now you weren't you weren't hitting me up every five minutes for an invite for the past two months to go to Buffalo Wild Wings or Barney's Beanery with me but you are for the super exclusive party that's like 2,000 bucks and free shit give it away to everybody that's they're super super pretentious I want to go to this party with six of my friends because I'm a real person I can't just handle $2,000 had been given away I need $12,000 I guess what I'm pointing out here is the hidden congruence and how this relates to guys wanting to go meet these beautiful women and then being mad that game is required that they would have to learn to socially interact or to game right and so if you look at say the party there's an incongruence cuz you're saying look I'm just a real person I just want to go to I just came to hang out you bro because it's real it's like you can come to my house anytime you want about your you're choosing to come on this day and then you're mad that you're plus nine million can't come because you know you're real now probably the look to be fair they're doing it because they're a little bit nervous to go to a party by themselves they don't feel like I'd fit in I understand the mentality behind it but it's that it's like that shaming that I that I got from I probably got the identical shaming from about thirty or forty different friends of mine who were mad that they couldn't just stack in there plus one and even going deeper of my mansion my Big Mike they they say some of them just start texting him directly to get their Plus Ones dead now this guy's running a 70 million dollar your business and you are now pestering him for your plus one when he's already giving you thousands of dollars again for free so this is something that a lot of people don't understand right so some of my friends who run large businesses if say that I'm going to their house and I don't know the directions sometimes like the person that's in the car with me them in the car the girl she'll say you know why don't you why don't you text them and ask the directions if that guy was sitting around giving directions to everybody who came he wouldn't be the multi millionaire or billionaire whose party were going to like let the man live right like the unique value that he offers is that he's the billionaire with the super sick party and that you can brag to your friends and let this man live speaking about that by the way just with direction I throw an event tonight for free for the inner circle in LA like show up let's all go out together and there was an actual post in facebook under the event saying hey chi'lan I'm new to LA I need the exact directions to the venue we're going to and I need you to tell me exactly where it is and texting your number so we can keep up I'm like what yeah and here's the thing right so people will say it like like well Julian if you're a real person you should be responding that right you're not a hair you're not above that right and and like you know like sometimes we'll go to say Tony Shay's party or he owns apples calm like I think you sold if I could build Amazon and it's like why should Tony just as the billionaire he thinks he's above giving directions that I understand to be Tony or to even do what you're doing now you can't be giving directions to hundreds of people it wouldn't even be worth going to your thing if that was the case cause I think it's kind of interesting you note that however the reason that the people even asked that is because they can't conceive of a life where you don't have time to give direction so if you're talking about a guy in the UK this analogies back to game as it were it's like literally if you're trying to step to a quota code of ten and you're not you know those subjectively physically attractive to her answer or rather you know maybe you're not on her level in terms of a copy of not your ugly yeah okay succinct let's just be concise about it oh the fuck you're ugly a lot of these guys and I see this all in the inner circles and all on the boards like guys they simply cannot conceive much like the guy who can't conceive that the guy who is hosting the party might simply not have fucking time to answer every like douchebag Direction Renato need that but if you let in all the plus sixes the party that will exist right he answered every single Direction question that meetup wouldn't be happening that billionaire that's inviting you to the party if he asked to give directional time that guy wouldn't be a billionaire you gotta let the man lift the shit wouldn't exist if that ten fuck every six she would be a whore she would be the town bike she wouldn't be the tenant you want so you have to give to get there's obviously a lot of this happened  obviously a very visceral like a very uh you know like a close to home topic to help you right but yeah and by the way anywhere you will fuck anybody but everyone you see the level of frustration that instructors often feel when we're seeing guys come with this very like entitled sense of you know self-worth that they can just step to the girl go up and be like hey and she should just be like oh hey oh oh hey oh money please suck your dick like they literally said that I think does somebody I'm just real but I'm real I just not been a guy I'm nice I'm real so look okay it's one thing to bitch and moan about you know the perceived in failings of the the students but it wouldn't be our see unless we provided tangible ways out in tangible solutions can ease the pain and heartbreak of being a little bitch so what's your take on that so the basic frame is a guy he's coming from that mindset of why can't that like this ten doesn't even have like I have to develop myself I have to work on game and she just sits there but what you're not understanding is her ancestors stepped up that's why like take Pierre Trudeau his son is Justin Trudeau Pierre Trudeau's kind of funny-looking kind of looks like me intense and bold and philosophical then Pierre Trudeau manned up and got a hot baby mama because he man the fuck up and then his child is good-looking so now Justin Trudeau now he did marry a pretty regular girl but the point is that he'd wanted to I'm sure he could fuck just about every girl in all Canada ed most in the world and that being the case Justin Trudeau's dad stepped up so he has what's called DNA or genes my ancestors are a great line of crowd of balding gingers so that being the case they they stayed in that world and now I'm a nil so as an elf I have to make it I consider you're going I'm a real elf I'm a real balding ginger I shouldn't have to do all these look these girls just sit there why should I have to develop myself having elf she should just reproduce with the help kind of quite right okay you can do that and you can see how far you can get with that where I can say you know what look I've got other stuff I could offer maybe I can build my social skills my buy my public speaking maybe I can grow a cool beer or a cool jacket maybe I can make friends than everybody in the club introduce people to each other in the club and then come across as a guy just this popular so to speak maybe I can learn that she loves to have her emotions pump and pump her emotions maybe I can chase get her chasing my validation a little bit and make it fun what people to understand this game it's not about disrespect it's actually about respect if I walk into a movie theater and I see a one movie at another movie maybe I'm about to go with this movie but then I see there's a more entertaining movie I just picked the more nor to anyone because I don't know that director personally I've not invested in him I don't owe him anything to the crappier movie so I just go to the better movie but guys are frustrated that the girl just picks the better guy what I think is rather than viewing a game as as like taking view game as giving you're relating to the person where they're at you wouldn't see us doing a video here and public speaking in a lazy way not being engaging with you and the demanding that you watch the video because you're real and to me that's the most lowbrow excuse so when you make a decision to learn game and you decide to learn how to engage with women in a way that is a way that's attractive essentially realize that you're giving and you're giving to get so be a person who is a giver and then realize that instead that the bad I don't think that's in authentic person isn't a girl it's you because you're wanting something for nothing so stop wanting something like stop trying to bring six people to this party and save yourself how could I make it where they want to invite where they're begging me to buy my friends the party the Nancy Ramirez - a question going further because I see this stuff a lot - you know guys they can't seem to reconcile the idea of quote giving value they think somehow it's personally like degrading them and you'll see you'll see variants on this this question like how to give value without you know demeaning myself or something like that being like hard they don't they don't they think it's what do you call it it's a win-lose right it's a win-lose game it's a zero-sum games that they like this will like being afraid to being try hard to be needy that's like the number one thing that will fuck up your results like I've seen guys like oh I don't want to walk home cuz I don't me try hard I don't want to go say hi cause I'll be try out I'll look needy I don't wanna look needy fuck that if that's like the one thing holding you back fuck that be needy be try yeah that reminds me of a classic story I like to tell which I had assumed on a bootcamp one and so it's near the end of the night he's in with a girl it's going quite well and he comes over to me you know the lights come up he's like okay what do i do how do i how do i get her out of here what are we doing like okay just do this not enough so in the time it took to do that he turns around and now let's go talk to some other guy and she leaves with the guy and he's like what do i do what do i do i'm like yo go run run after go get her it's like but what doesn't that seem needy I'm like sure okay let me put it like this okay you got to officer option a your run after maybe you look needy but maybe you get her right option two you stand here and do nothing what is what do you think is going to happen like she's going to be walking away with the dude and all of a sudden be like feel like a minute let me go oh my god so so non needing me you know what you I get it go sorry just God non-needy I'm going back like that's not gonna fucking happen dude so again you might look needy but you might actually get the girl right so I think these kind of distinctions are not valid you know they're not again it may very well be the case but you got to look at the practicalities involved right yeah do you do you enjoy having free videos comes out by RSD all the time that could be viewed as needy and I think that part of why I you know I can rants about this is because I want you to win I want people to wait in general so you know it's not the end of the world to me if somebody starts crying about not getting invited to a party it's not not really to skin off my back but I want you to win and so what I'm trying to teach her is calibration and it's that awareness of give to get and it's an awareness that you have to meet people where they're at so it's never bothered me that you know say like a click debate title on a YouTube video for somebody who's never heard of our videos and maybe they're kind of surfing around the internet in a derp state and maybe they wanted to delay ting title so I'm not going to sit there going oh I can't do that for them yeah it's just a situation that whether it's genetics which like it or not that puts people in demand or whether it's finances or whatever else it is look unless you're honestly going for girls that are not very attractive unless you're trying to go to Barney's Beanery or Buffalo Wild Wings then then don't complain about it take that same energy that you put into complaining and all that emotional juice put that into thinking how to offer value yeah to be fair there are some situations where you would you would be legit upset if they could like say you did want to go to the Buffalo Wild Wings thing like you legit wanted to go but then they're like no I can't bring your plus-one and you're in you're like dude it's fucking Buffalo Wild Wings then you would have a legitimate reason to be distraught over it right and look there is something to be said for like a sort of delusional self-confidence that can be quite it can be quite compelling for some people you know and again we've done things of this nature where I remember when we were in Monaco that one year and we rolled up to that that Club and there wasn't even a line it was just like a giant crowd of extremely good-looking cable trying to muscle like just get picked out of this crowd by the people going in so we decided I don't know whose idea was maybe NYX maybe harshest we elbow our way up to fucking people are like what are you fucking doing we're like get out of the fucking way we elbow to the front and then they look at harsh who is our buddy who's Indian and I don't know what they assumed I mean he's dressed in head-to-toe and Ed Hardy and it's like 2006 when over that shit was cool like he literally has head-to-toe ed hardy had already underwear ed hardy socks and they look at him and I think they just assumed he was like a royal chair or something so I'm like okay you in and they let us all in but yeah I mean come on let's be in realistic is there other some instances and we're being and just like delusional self-confidence storm up to Big Mike's place with ten of your fucking slubby dude friends and just like walk in could that conceivably work at some level yeah but again you got to pick your battles we're not any more like try but just don't be driven when he didn't work private don't be butter when it didn't work exactly like he doesn't get in Slyke don't you see the ed hardy motherfucker I can't believe this shit I can buy your family I can buy your fucking family now if you just say that at one point for someone but until you frame but but he could but he actually could but but that's neither here nor there now but what I'll say it's yeah it's like social intelligence like start being aware okay what's actually going on here versus you're delusional stories the same with a girl like you know why doesn't she ponder to my story I'm real like you hide behind these like values and being real thinking that that makes you entitled to get the girl fuck no it's like that girl she's there instead of trying to you know meet your way in or try to make her go down to your level because of the fact that you're real or you're of integrity or so on that you don't judge so on and so forth why don't you make it a win-win for you and her and get to that point where she wants to be a man and nobody knows shit about you or your style or what you represent or how the way you live until you bring it to their ass you know what I mean so unless they know unless you have somehow demonstrated to them why you feel you're deserving of the seat of attention or admission to the party or what have you then how the fuck would they even know right again it's just assuming that everyone knows your autobiography everyone knows where you're coming from like you got to bring it to the raps you got to bring the value to their ass you know you can't just imagine it's self-evident it's a decision to relate well yeah yeah even that and it's also like start being disgusted with this pity shit because it's really that it's like a lot of game guests for example it's like they're being invited and they think that it's like just give me the invite like out of pity I'm real out of pity like fuck that like I would rather not be invited or be invited because I deserve the authentic invites where it's all like please please like please invite me I'm I'm real pleased if I my plus-one it's like no fuck yeah it's like the pity fuck it's like they should want and they should quantico be begging you to get your fucking plus one in not the other way around and like people have such low standards like just give me in anything like the pity fuck girl get give me the ten for the pity pot I go sir like I got a lot of good vision like the baby fun which you know the pity I don't I mean I know guys they're like they're like yeah that I know a couple of guys okay nothing right he's like a pity fuck just don't be shocked in like a learn a joke she didn't give him a fitting sake and indignant yeah and claiming superiority yeah yeah yeah that's it for us right there yeah hiding behind the pity party I'd say you know I remember once one of my mentors Alex he said to me he said nice is overrated in the sense that he's like there's a lot of people that are kind of just nice but they don't do anything they're just kind of like hey what's up whereas sometimes people who actually push themselves do high-level maybe you're kind of extreme they have a bit more in personality and you could judge those people but they produce certain results that doesn't look that doesn't mean that it's ideal to be somebody who's crushing it and then lord over everybody to be an asshole but at the same time there's if the person is really push themselves and they might have a bit of extreme personality traits why don't you just take them for who they are and stop judging them and say well if I if I had tried that hard maybe I'd be a little grumpy or a little bit short people if I you know if I just work like you know 14-hour 16-hour days for 15 years to get to that point maybe I'd be a little short people now ideally that guy like the ultimate to me is a guy who's at that level and really is humble and really does like take it with the real people and stuff like that like that's great with a girl who's on that level and does did like the regular guy a chance or whatever yeah like that's that's wonderful but when that happens it's a bonus but it doesn't necessarily have to be expected and I think it's when you have like there's a confusion with what we're saying or that's two of them I could think of one is don't think that we're saying not to try like definitely like what the harsh example going to the club in Monaco go for it look it's not like when I came to LA I didn't like just store them up to the front of the club or just go up to the tent and just act like I expect her to fuck me and occasionally one time and a kazillion it just BAM just worked you should totally do it it's just that issue that don't then when it doesn't work get indignant and then just stop trying to develop yourself under this other things like well these girls don't have to try so why should i and then the other one is we tell you to assume attraction we tell you that you are enough we tell you that never put anyone above you so what I'm saying here and what we're talking about collectively could be confusing because it's almost like this weird message of well now we're saying no you you are inferior right and and that's not what it is that's not the message at all oh it's a every frame is actually a paradox okay so for example it's like be engaging but be congruent or be self-amused but don't be a reaction seeking so the same way like like and every frame is a paradox every single frame that we teach is a paradox be confident yourself but then still learn from mentors it's always a paradox right have massive intent but freedom from outcome everything's a paradox so in this case it's like assume value assume you're on that level just totally assume it's going to work out but then at the same time still work to develop yourself so that you can relate and have something to offer to people so that when you do go up it's a natural fit so that you do walk up to that 10 and the next day you're waking up and a lot of the times she's texting you trying to meet up with you because you're bringing something to the table and what I find about this is that it feels good man like it feels good to bring some to the table and just relate in a win-win way as opposed to just walking around pits of the world that you're not getting handouts you know under some guys that is owed to you or something like that and it just feels nice to really put in the work and you know to be in a place where you know you're welcome as opposed to being in the situation that you kind of know you shouldn't have it and when you're new and you don't have a lot to offer blaghhh your way through it and always assume you're enough and always assume you're on everybody's although never put anyone above you but then the paradox of that is simultaneously do put in the work to make it an easy fit so that you know you get you know those invites or those dates or those sexual experiences are a no brainer yeah and that's me that's really where we talk about the joy of taking action and then the the journey is the destination etc those kinda ideas they come from starting to cultivate this kind of thinking and watching the results in yourself and in your external results with women and you know business and your relationships and so forth as you go forward and get older and cultivate this again these dis embrace of these paradoxes ideas more and more and rather than letting yourself off the hook too because here's the funny anytime I've ever made a video where I talk about anything whether it's exclusive or high society or celebrity or ten there's a consistent feedback in common saying I don't care about tens I don't care about celebrities I don't care about Heidi I don't care about being rich I don't care about this assistant and you know what that's fine but first of all let me make a point if you don't care across you but I know a lot of people that don't care and they're not usually the ones that feel that need to type in I don't care usually it's the people that type in I don't give a fuck about that or the ones who do there was a girl yesterday was like I don't care about celebrities and in this look at her I'm going you so do like like a lot of people don't yeah just you do what so every I'm sure there's some celebrity she's there that are just the fact that light or like the guy who's like sees out hot girls like I wouldn't fuck her she's a slut that's called sour grapes okay look that is that Aesop's fable sour grapes and what that means is that you're just saying oh those grapes the top of the tree are sour it's a lot more fun to say you know what I really don't I get a celebrity right your people I don't really that exclusive events not the shit there's great parties that are not exclusive I know that I don't need that at all because when you need it you don't get it right that which you need and crave you don't get so of course just let it go but don't also just don't just let yourself off the hook for just doing something like interesting things like look hanging out I'd say a super expensive party it's not like it's the biggest shit we do this stuff regularly and frankly I have just as much fun going out the crew to grab a bite to eat so I'm not saying that it's like the shit I don't I don't think here's what's funny I don't think anyone ever didn't say that it was a shit it's not we're sitting here going oh oh my god oh no cat oh oh we're just saying that's something to do is it never ride on the motherfucking amusement park there's a lot of different cool rides just one of them and you know why not why not like just say how do our value to be the kind of person that I have choices I don't I don't you're going to be happy ultimately when you get that 10 I don't you to be happy ultimately when you get rich I don't know you're gonna be happy ultimately when you get invited that party because that which you don't feel inside you'll never manifest outside anyway you've got to feel like you're fucking attend you got to feel like you're at that great part you got to feel like you're rich now to have that in your reality now feel it right now look and then you'll you have if you had the experience of having done all that stuff and then you're still after the fact you think well you know that sucked if that party was shit he's fucking 10 then sure you're you're welcome to that opinion that's for fucking prerogative alright but until then it is that literal a soft sour grapes mm-hm by the way I taught him that so this is one of our students we taught them how to do all that you know um yeah yeah welcome can why you you guys question real quick if you if would you rather it's going to be in the video you have a choice yesterday or be a or be yes or no rather what would you rather punch you know wait how did you how did you two guys to meet each other never friend a friend how long have you known each other a month a month how's it going sexy I don't know no no yet Eddie whoa and he's so good-looking dude what's the punch what went wrong he can I hear the punch one instead oh there's the punch one ok did you not cute enough so you kissing a hot kiss like I didn't fight for his outside of Tucson area go this is your night okay take her home go on don't end on I go hey girl hey girl you're good you're good we appreciate it thank you thank you for being the vid just protective action though you've got it because Trump's gonna make abortion illegal soon so you're going to need to make sure that that abortion well I wanted and we're condom so abortion illegal soon wear condom so a great example there though that guy tall attractive guy got a girl that you know I said I don't think that is way out of his range and yet a month in doesn't have sex and guys think that it's going to solve all the problems wah-wah-wah so anyway um if you had that girl that Han but you didn't even give a callback I might probably not but I might you know you never know it's a case-by-case basis you I want to give value and get and give to get as you get as much as much as possible anyway okay so let's just kind of just just go forward man there's cool rides in the park go for it if you can't get it that's cool to try for stuff put it out there if it doesn't happen at school people always just be thinking how can I offer value don't chase elevate your game until you attract what you want again don't chase and whine and rationalize elevate your game until what you want chases you you'll have a much happier life you're a giving person now and best of all you're congruent and in alignment with yourself rather than being inauthentic and bullshitting and that doesn't mean don't take action it's like like people are like I talk about some like don't pursue a track like well I can't open like fuck no it's like beneath that the surface it's like yeah girls take action in opening yeah the frame behind it like the assumption behind it is I'm opening in order to attract I'm doing this in order to attract I'm taking action in order to attract say people to come and talk to me I'm going up to talk to her to create the opportunity for her to meet me yeah and we can go really deep down this rabbit hole you know into what actually exactly constitutes for giving a value and so forth but I think that's kind of beyond the scope of what we're talking about here again it's really just maintaining that sort of gracious attitude as you interact in it and as you said making the choice to relate you'll be whining yeah that people don't just get you exactly right away Robert Greene talks about this about people like the example Robert Greene gives I think it was mastery but I don't remember he said that originally one of the great causes of debt from Bert like when when childbirth like the kids died was because the hospital workers hundreds of years ago didn't wash their hands and finally this guy realized that if you just wash your hands all these kids wouldn't die so he runs around going oh the kids are going to die if you don't wash your hands because there's these invisible germs on them which back that is unrelatable at fuck right you're they're more likely to believe that the devil killed the kid that in germ at that point it so he runs around according to robert greene and i might be misremembering this because I read a lot many years ago I think he said the guy just runs around whaling and not being relatable and if he would have made the choice to relate millions of lives of children would have been saved but by being on his high horse and just saying they should just get me and I shouldn't put in the work to be relatable millions of lives are lost so that's obviously a very extreme example but many girls who could have slept with many parties who have gone to many friends you could have had could it happen if you just made a simple choice to say you know what I know they don't get it but I've got to cultivate something I've got to relate and then when I do everybody wins yeah the onus is on you it's not on them and you can whine about how to sit there oh it kind of sucks but you know what that's the game and if you want to win the game you got to learn to operate in the parameters but not whine and complain about the parameters if you have to even know the parameters normal don't worry be happy that you know what the fucking parameters are those those people don't it's been only Julianne and your proverbial boys yep  [Music]",XCFdc1g1G7w
yo yo what up boy Jeffy I'm here in rainy Seattle and today we're going to talk about making time so a lot of times I'll hear guys on the forum complaining that they simply cannot afford to make the time commitment that is required to actually get good that cold approach pick up you know they said what if I don't have time to go out well if you're expecting me to give you some kind of secret shortcut like some sort of uh six-minute abs type shit for pickup you have come to the wrong place you know it's really time for someone to cut the crap and tell you the truth about how much effort it takes to develop a great skill set in game and what most people want to hear is that you don't have to work hard okay all you need is the magic pill all right the secret trick that is going to up your game by 100% and this is why people in the community have traditionally gravitated towards things like say Julianne's drama or the apocalypse opener or the october sequence the annihilation factor you know these kind of things the quick fix type of magic pill stuff but what you need to hear is that there's in fact a substantial time and effort commitment that must be made if you want to develop a noticeably improved level of social intelligence and to think otherwise is simply delusional or gullibility okay the truth is good game is actually an aggregate of a bunch of little things that by themselves might help 1% each but you put them all together and how are you able to internalize these things so that you're gonna have access to them immediately dynamically in the field as the relevant situations come up you know in real time again that comes only from a very substantial time and effort commitment if you're doing this you know recreationally like say you just want to improve your social skills a bit maybe get a girlfriend well your time commitment then for going out might be as little as a couple times a week for an hour or two per session however if you're aspiring to become some insane pickup superhero or maybe even like an instructor or something like that well then the time commitment will be substantially more you're not gonna get the game of save Julian a Tyler and Alex from just minutes a day in the gym okay skill sets of that caliber come from many many hours spent in the field and I don't have time is the number one reason that people have for why they can't fit everything in but in fact it's not a valid excuse at all it's simply some excuse made by lazy people we all have the same 168 hours in a week we're all busy but some get better at the game and some people don't why is it luck genetic predisposition no the people who get successfully good at coal pickup coal approach pickup have made the training a priority in their life they make that time even if it means getting less sleep and paying for it it worked the next day as I did for several years or maybe giving up an hour of television and nights to go out successful people use every hour wisely and very rarely will fritter their time away and unproductive and meaningless activities one example of this would be video games a couple years ago my girlfriend got me a Wii for Christmas and I became slightly addicted to this game Scarface the world is yours okay it's kind of like Grand Theft Auto except you're running around as Al Pacino building a drug empire in like swearing in Spanish okay I call your fuck yourself right so it's pretty fun but then I looked up and realized I had just wasted two months of my life you know of my precious time learning a skill that had absolutely no bearing on or usefulness in my actual life I mean even today I'm not perfect at as many of you know I spend a great deal of time watching television what I consider to be quality television and I also occasionally partake in the devil's lettuce okay I also have a lot of sex which could in some ways be viewed as an unproductive and meaningless activity in fact in his book the war of art Steven Pressfield talks about these kind of activities and lumps them together under the umbrella of the term resistance and yes sometimes resistance takes the form of sex because sex provides an immediate and powerful gratification okay and Pressfield in fact goes on to say that this principle applies to alcohol drugs shopping masturbation gossip and quote the consumption of all products containing fat sugar salt or chocolate but the truth is you're always going to make time for whatever is most important in your life if watching a TV show is you know important to you whether you're gonna make time for that like tonight have no watch Breaking Bad okay if reading a book a week is important you're gonna make time for that going to the gym is important to you you'll make the time if being with a loved one is important to you you will make the time and if improving your game is important to you you'll make the time so you have to make going out a top priority in your life you're being honest with yourself if you say well you know the games is not that important to me or you know I'm not motivated to do it right now or I just choose not to go out that much but you can never honestly say I don't have time because that's never a valid reason the average person in the United States watches five hours of television per day okay and yet those same people still use no time as their number one excuse for why they don't go out back in the day personally I was so committed to learning the game you know what any cost then I went out seven nights a week while having a nine-to-five job did it absolutely suck after a hard night's partying often staying up till 5:00 a.m. like dealing with LMR like begging to have to then get up on three hours of sleep and like drag a blade across my face throw some monkey suit on and then go pretend to be attentive that's a budget meeting where they're droning on like I'm all fucked up and they're like yeah dude the GPS report do I mean yeah it sucked but for me there was simply no other alternative I made the time and the bottom line you'll never find the time you must make the time even if that means sacrificing in other areas this is Jeffy I'm gonna get the fuck out of the rain head back to San Francisco and I'll see you next time,XUwaFtbB5v0
whatup Jeff I'm here in Anchorage Alaska freezing my proverbial balls off here to bring you another amazing video blog of glory now today what I want to talk about is a question that I get very frequently on boot camps and that's when guys they're talking about strategies to employ four different types of group dynamics when we're talking about game as it were obviously there's gonna be a lot of overarching principles that apply however when faced with unique situations there may be unique approaches to each situation and so when you're interacting with groups there are a lot of common dynamics that you're gonna encounter for example ideally you're gonna find the girl that's there by herself for example if I'm out and it's on a Tuesday and I wander into the local bar and I see a girl there by herself I know that she's likely there because she's looking for some sort of companionship for the evening so it's going to be gay awesome times now more likely of course they're gonna be out with a friend okay when you encounter the girl so they might be out with a singular girlfriend so a lot of guys will say how do I approach it when the girls there with her one girlfriend basically in any scenario I'm always going to advise the guy to approach the girl that he's actually interested in first and speak with her first now of course this does not now mean that you then proceed to ignore her ignore the friend and exclude the friend from the interaction because of course what's gonna happen if you do that well she's going to sit there for a time you know if you're lucky and then she's going to you know pop and drag her away right so most guys don't know how to deal with this and they'll make one of two errors okay error number one they will completely ignore the less attractive friend and of course what this will inevitably result in her popping dragging the girl away and the I think a lot of times the reason guys do this is because they're fucking oblivious you know I see guys in there and I think they're so wrapped up in like oh what do I say what do I do that they're just not paying attention to what the hell's going on around them yes I do advocate that when you're talking to the Earl you square up and you look her in the eye you don't I mean you square up you look her in the fucking eye however this does not mean that you don't pay attention to what's going on in the periphery okay you always need to be glancing around from time to time seeing what's going on in the periphery are the friends behind you laughing like they're like look getting picked up is that scenario happening that's not good even worse are the friends behind you going like this Oh gross no no okay if that stuff's happening you need to be aware of it and then address it alright maybe there's a fight that's about to break out two guys about to fight next to you it doesn't even matter if you have anything to do with it it doesn't fucking matter if that fight busts off you know it could cause a break in the Cascade of positive emotions and then the girl can just change her my bit you know what I got to go find my friends again even if you had nothing to do with it so again be aware of what's going on around you now for example but in this we're talking about something slightly different where the friends obviously right they're standing next door and you're approaching them as a to set quote-unquote so what you want to do in that scenario is you want to flirt with both of them again open your target first and then you actually want to flirt with both of them you want to flirt with the fat girl okay however you're doing it as Julian says for the sake of flirting it'll be very evident that there's no actual oomph behind it there's no actual dick behind it so when you're talking to this girl you're flirting with her to actually flirt when you're talking to this girl you're flirting with her for the sake of flirting and she's gonna know it she's gonna know what you're doing but she's gonna at least appreciate that you have the social intelligence to actually pay attention to her as a valid worthwhile human being now I've done properly what this is going to do is a lot of time she'll be like okay this guy's cool I give the blessing and she'll either like be down with it and you know actively facilitate you going with her friend because she thinks you're cool and you showed social intelligence by paying attention to her or you know she may even just go off in the night into the night to do her own thing or find her own guy or whatever okay now of course like I said there's two major mistakes that guys make with us one they ignore the friend two they over engage the friend right so now they you know they over engage the less attractive friends so now the girl that are actually interested in might see it and be like oh birth that never gets a chance this guy seems to really like Bertha I'm just gonna bow out here and but Bertha get her her action now you're talking to Bertha so again you don't want to over engage but you don't want to ignore either so in the two set of girls open the one you want flirt with your flirt with her with actual intent behind it and flirt with this one for the sake of flirting if done properly it'll work out now let's say that they're there and they're in a bigger group of friends okay a larger group it depends of course your again you're gonna want to go in and talk to the girl that you're interested in first okay unless you're really unless you have like a really like kool-aid man like charismatic personality and you're able to just bowl in there and just dominate the entire group of like seven people very few people are gonna be able to actually pull this off I mean maybe like maybe if I let a Bill Clinton or something or you know if you're like some high your Tom Cruise so I'm like extremely charismatic person like charisma plus seventy five but for the vast majority of guys here it's not gonna be able to do that especially in a loud club environment so again open the girl you're interested in and if she's highly engaged with the group then you're going to have to you know have have her introduce you to the group in fact will be like introduce me your friends and then I'll go around like and again not over-the-top not like some weirdo just like a cool normal charismatic person oh hey are you going I am just some idiot am Jeff how are you oh good to meet you you know just normal handshake what's your name say your name nice to meet you right maybe you know crack a little joke here and there but again you do not want to over engage the entire group just introduce that they know that the girl's cool with you right and and then and then peel off you know a lot of times she's not gonna be heavily engaged to the group and then if you open just her what'll happen is the rest of the group will be talking to one another and you can kind of actually you know have a little time to decide to kind of work it more but at a certain point the friends are gonna come up and what are they gonna do they're gonna they're gonna try to save her right now why is save the girl why is that the autopilot default response 90% of the time when they see they see a girl their friend B talk to you my guy why is that ah times up I'll tell you why because 90% of the time the girl actually needs to be saved because the guy fucking sucks okay so you know what oh well even if you're the 10% that's not the guy that she needs to be safe from it doesn't fucking matter do you know why you're just collateral damage because 90% of the time it's the right move think about if you're walking down the street and some homeless person comes up to you right 90% of the time they're at a spare trash what do you do there's like I'm sorry do it and you just leave now maybe one time out of ten the guy comes up he's like oh man hey you know my car broke down do you have $2.00 I just need to call my friend at it uh and you just give the autopilot response oh sorry man and you walk down the street now maybe you get about thirty feet away and then you realize you think yourself well hey that guy wasn't dressed like a homeless person maybe I was just a fucking dick to that dude he really needed help but guess what oh well who gives a shit because they're already thirty feet down the street like the girl might blow you out be like hmm that guy actually seems cool maybe oh well who gives a shit because the next fucking dude is gonna come up in ten seconds anyway so it doesn't even matter so rather than bemoan the fact that oh the cock blocks and this and that I can look at the reality and develop strategies to deal with it as opposed to being like oh dude so unfair so the first thing I'm gonna do is I want to force like say I'm talking the girl she's in the group and I've been talking to her for a bit and the friends come up I want to preempt that bullshit okay I want to force that that uh do I need to save you conversation to happen immediately I want to force that shit so and again as soon as they come up the first thing I'm gonna do BAM charismatic Lee introduce myself it doesn't matter if I'm in the middle of telling her the funniest joke in the world and I'm about to hit the punch line if that person comes in I'm gonna drop it dim oh hey how's it going I'm Jeff nice to meet you boom right because if you stand there and do nothing when the friend comes and gets introduced what's gonna happen what's gonna happen they're gonna see you standing there doing nothing and they're going to assume what they are going to assume here's a chode picking her up if you introduce yourself who would that well someone she knows her friend her co-worker her colleague her roommate her classmate her fucking cousin her gay friend whatever okay so they'll treat you like a normal person of course at a certain point they're gonna be how do you know each other and she's gonna be oh we just met at which point like watched her fucking brain like like what I've been trading him nice I want to treat him like a dick now I don't know what to do right but again you've bought yourself a little time but at a certain point they are going to look at her and give her that do you are you okay here either they're gonna verbally say it or they're gonna give her that look so I want to preempt that conversation immediately so again what am I gonna do I'm gonna throw my armour on the girl and I'm gonna say Wendy and I love one whatever her name is Wendy and I love one another and we hope that you approve of our union okay I'll say that and what they're gonna do they're gonna look at her face when I say this and at her face like this like yeah then they're no you're fucking idiot they're gonna saber okay however if she's like yeah it's true now this motherfucker can't see shit okay sometimes they'll still try be like no I don't approve in which gets to go oh well we don't give a fuck we were just being polite and now now you're disinvited I don't know what you're disinvited from butchered is invited from and that kind of breaks the tension like when you first say I don't give a fuck they're like oh shit you can feel like a tension in the whole group then I'm like but you're disinvited I don't know it is amount of uh-huh and that'll kind of like take the take the edge off you know take that tension away and they'll all kind of laugh and usually after that they'll accept you so yeah those are the three or four major dynamics that you're typically going to encounter when the girl that you want to interact with is out with either a female friend by herself or with a mixed group of friends in the next video I'm gonna discuss what to do when she's out with a guy when you when you see her there and she's there with a guy whether that's her male friend whether that's her boyfriend or whether it's just some Rando commando that she just met and the best practices for each one of those scenarios so anyway I want to get back inside as you can see the sun's actually going down it's 3 p.m. and they come around this time of year the Sun comes off bottle I am here and goes down around 3 so I'm gonna get while the getting's good and I'll see you next week,XVLcP5zVjcc
you have to learn to enjoy yourself in the club environment and dude you might be thinking well I don't like that kind of shit rot away the club it seems terrible it's pretty loud it's dark it's lights in my face these assholes everywhere you have to understand none of us up here are cut from a different cloth okay none of the instructors would come from the different cloth we all have to struggle with this stuff at the beginning we had to read engineer our belief systems okay I remember back when I first started out just walking up to the club and hearing the music inside like lining up and just hearing the music inside I could have I can't believe I have to do this shit I have to go in here talk to these people have to make a fool of myself this is terrible right now it is I'm walking to like any of the major clubs like you know story in Miami excess and fucking Bay is anyways like being magnifies out typically wouldn't fuck absolutely terrifies me I walk in there and like it's funny cuz my friend my friend take you take them to a picture of you walk into the club dome how did you see him like this Mike it's like a kid like waiting a line for Space Mountain or something he was just gonna admit it onto the ride it's like yeah Space Mountain it's like we have a lot of exercises for this if one of them on campus we do I you said Alex maybe have you thought about toilet paper Miyagi and we would have the students is like exceptionally like we had this guy was it gives it not was across Sydney and he was like just again derping around very seriously every time I've heard we'd be able to pop him up for a little bit but do they do and then you know go work with other student tour a shirt out he's like right I can't do it out of this house tonight fuck you you need to come over to the fans were wrong in look in the mirror and really look at yourself and think about what you've done five minutes and when you come back out great toilet paper  so I'll finally yeah five minutes see that he goes in these for five minutes excellent come on let's have some booze or some shit guy says thanks like all right time for toilet paper Miyagi and Emily takes it and like wraps this like headband or other guy's head remind me this is like August or something it sound like Halloween up like that and he's like now your goal you want to go to epic Melvin say this hello my name is Miyagi I'm here to teach you karate and your goal is to get to kiss lipstick on your forehead of Rising Sun or a negative kiss I think just like draw a rosy Sun on your forehead and then the guy beat you the guy who actually he was Japanese  but yeah so he goes if that thing is now he's doing this thing it's like that will be observed by design and what happens the girls I should start responding to a well because there's no way he can try to play that off like he's like he's trying to be mr. cool right there's no way you do that shit like so for me like really especially you did you guys do or not tonight you guys going out this weekend we really tried like really trying to have fun in the club and again even if you're not feeling it like like that's an environment that you typically enjoy yourself in right now you can in fact condition yourself to enjoy that all right can't affect adjust yourself to enjoy it because fly over time will start getting more more reference experiences of that club being a source of a lot of fun times not just fun times with the girls like you know but also fun times like just your friends fucking hanging out shit like make the myths right build the fucking the memories that will last throughout the millennium right that won't that go down through the centuries by the way I hope you bring the shit good great example of this okay I went out I was like yeah we gonna like do I really want to take this fucking sword like it's annoying you're gonna have to carry around like another like in the beginning that I walked through clubs like people are fucking it trying to sit down but of course by the end of I wasn't fully in there sort of like you  if I hadn't brought it I would have been pissed other than my wife you bring them you know I mean I go to civilize I'm like getting ready to going for Clubman this is giant ridiculous obviously fake Jesus chain please let go of it why don't I bring the bling that's interesting too because that also ties in with just just going out period a lot of times hounds would be like you know you're in your house yeah like because you think you're small chunking it you're thinking about every single baby step is gonna take you to get your ass in the club you're like I'm sitting here right now I'm watching the latest episode of Vampire Diaries and I if I were to got your friends calling you up come on man let's go beast the streets feeling you know I have to get the shower and then I have to put my shoes on and then I have to fucking go get in the car drive then they have to find parking when in line for the club go there and for what you know and so again why do we do that a nurse is very powerful you know it's homeostasis you're in a comfortable position right now guys we've been a free tour before anyone ever been a free tour for ya know she makes you do at the end typically the evil Stifler laughs or the Stifler laughs well you know what he says that this thing do you go how do you feel right now I'm pretty good do you want to feel really happy right now I never once of course like yeah you say that but you really don't you're just you're like I'm comfortable now stay in this position with you know stands comfortable state something as you get out like duties this physiology thing where you actually pump your own physiology sheerly like just by you like jumping around and laughing like forcing yourself to laugh like a fake you laughing but after 30 seconds of that you'll be you'll feel your body you're noticeably feeling better you're like me I didn't want to do the stupid ridiculous light laughter because I look like a fucking idiot it's stupid you know your this is stupid I don't like this I'm too cool for school right but then of course after you actually force yourself to do it you like oh shit you know what I do feel marginally better so it's the same thing with the club you know I bet you get your ass out the fucking front door don't small chunk in don't think I have to take a shower and my shoes on it go there I'm fine parking I go to find out they go to fuck just think go outside like literally go outside another thing to don't worry about ecology when I look just right who gives a fuck we're not girls there's no Russian problem man does not mean to be pretty five minutes to get ready five five fucking minutes yeah at the end of the day there's only a couple main principles and for many guys I'd say it's really letting go so again when you guys are going out this weekend tonight just think about letting go because like I said before you can you can emulate Tyler's game you can emulate trillions game you've been emulated perfectly down to the last syllable down to the last you know pronunciation like emphasis and everything like that you get all the nuances of pronunciation at the step it's not have the same effect this time from the rock plays eternally if you're trying to get in as opposed to having your own fun already bringing it again I can always tell this our bootcamp it's like it's like the guys looks like the instructors were like flying  this is science Matt okay if you have a cape on it actually makes you seven to ten percent cooler that's like a fan that's like a fucking fat nothing we see 70% colder but alcohol makes you 20% warmer like I was wearing this shit San Francisco last week and I was in Calgary last year and we pulled these like girls out of club and then I we don't have a car you could get a cab damn it we're gonna do I guess I'll have to walk back to the hotel it's like a mile it's fucking snowy billows damn cool I got this other shit it's called booze guitar I don't know if you know that you see a couple more boosters whose guitar is uh it's an item you can get in Las Vegas when you rock bar the Venetian and what it is it's a guitar and it's it's Hollow and they fill it with a frozen mousse concoction and a straw comes out usually can play this guitar like get drunk now when you're a really boost guitar that will actually make you 20 to 25 percent let go like I said yeah we're like flying the churches are flying around the club and it's like uh the student is like holding on for dear life like a branch like like dangly right he's like dangling above like some crevasse or some shit and when I let go man just fucking let go does it know if I let go I'm going to fall to my horrible grisly death like no no you can fly like us it's like fuck no boy trying to stop it Ryan we fucking try as fingers off but the thing is we can't force him to let go I can push a guy right up to the precipice but he has to take that leap of faith off much like in was it Indiana Jones the quest for the Holy Grail has to walk across the invisible bridge or whatever it's like that so you have to take that final leap of faith or like before like neo in the met with a bad news neo in the matrix what he like leaps off the building you got to believe it but then finally I can always tell find again let's go and then he's like he falls a little bit he's like woo they were right I can fly too your enemy starts having a good time and then he starts really owning shit yeah  I'm drunk  have a beer because if I'm going to be walking around outside like this you need the best blanket in the world or cell call but um no I'll tell you how I feel tell you okay I again I wasn't always like this I used to be the kind of person where I would be in my group of friends my group of friends is all very alpha it was very difficult to even get a word in edgewise you know you ever had this experience or hanging out with your friends and this big conversation going on you tonight hey there's someone talks over you it mean it's like hard to get the more demands myself if everyone is like really confident guys and I was always the fucking dude who would like I'd go out with my friends and yeah let's go out to the bar I'd go out Craig's would start feasting and shit we'd be together you have companies ready to start beating it up there's one friend making out with a girl in the corner there's a friend leaving with a girl other guys chat it up having a good time and I'm just kind of like the fucking Punk of the group you know well they call it the runt I'm like I'm not having a good time I'll just slip out unnoticed yeah it was great right but over time again I learned how to change that again oh you have to understand when you're talking about making changes to your identity you're not really you're talking about making changes to your personality I think in many ways that's not even possible you don't I mean you've grown up you know at least past a certain age I guess but I mean you can alter the way you respond to situations in the way you behave in social situations and it's not going to change so many guys say shit like this just as a DJ this isn't me and they think that doing the things that would be required to actually get girls with somehow mean fundamentally like letting go for identity and the thing is even if your identity sucks you still don't want let go of it because that's you you know it feels like a even if you know that the behaviors are actually disempowering you know for example I get I do shit like that I tell it like there's just fuck you kill yourself there's a lot of guys that think that's hilarious in the beginning you're an awesome bro you're an awesome bro and so to let go of even that even though it's a massively disempowering you like her full fuckin carmine perk my you know behavior part of that I go to strike Jenny right so but you might be thinking you know I'm just not that kind of guy I'm just a quiet guy I just don't speak up in these situations it's just not me the thing is your identity it's fluid it's a slow-moving fluid a very slow-moving fluid but it isn't that fluid you set to keep applying the pressure to it and the interesting thing is you can adopt different characteristics and yours I mean dude it doesn't change who you are ultimately you're still the same guy but you've got more empowering you've got a more empowering set of characteristics so I'll get you to sing but mom for example how do I learn it by putting myself in a high-pressure situation repeatedly over and over again even forgot to pick up I don't you guys do this but I was need 2005 karaoke champion of San Francisco  there I go I go that always sounds cooler in my mind before I see her every time yeah I keep saying but the fun of the matter is begin putting yourself in a situation where this is a big thing for gods they they're afraid to go up and on the set because if they're uncomfortably in the center of attention so throw yourself into situations where you're the center of attention over and over and over again I also took stand-up comedy workshop I also took improv comedy workshop I also do public speaking ostensibly all of these things contributed to make me better able to form like my thoughts on the fly lose my train of thought and then also uh you know basically pull more punching but interesting thing by the way when I took stand-up comedy workshop I was the best guy in the class but obviously by a huge margin I don't know why but when I took an improv fast I fucking sucked because there's like two different skill sets right stand up teach you how to be punchy and structure things so it's like a pest punch - it's concise laughs for a minute that's a big thing but improv you know you're on the spot and one thing that improv taught me the most important thing that improv Tommy and this transcript sort of the game as well was this if you're on stage with your partner you're doing a skit or whatever and your partner says something it's your turn to like respond even if you can't think of like the awesome and funny thing to say it's more important that you just say something right and you keep this kid alive and then hopefully they'll say something that then next that you can then okay now I can use that so you just keep it alive so again if you're in set and you're with a girl and you can't think of the awesome fucking hilarious thing to say just say something right keep an open mind again what are the five things but max is valid because it comes from me they're gonna find it interesting not because the content and because they're curious number three lower the bar for how good it has to be number four don't think ahead stay in the moment and number five is how do you say is the energy - yeah have you said that I quit your sign-off and for the good of God and country and for you folks at home this is business real I did some razors and broken glass over a several year period I'm a child of divorce what can I say,Y7damVcxMjs

Oh what up what up what up it's ya boy Jesse back for day 2 of the resonator preview video series so I created a resonator to fix one of the most fundamental problems that I see on bootcamp but so very often guys approach girls in the club they say their opener and then the girls don't even fucking look at them and many times it's because the girls legitimately can't even hear him like the guys just aren't projecting loud enough but other times the girls can hear them but let's just say they don't like what they hear which is to be precise fear neediness and just playing shaky and unattractive tone now the thing is most of the time these guys truly believe that they're already speaking as loudly as they possibly can and beyond that they have zero idea of the sub communications that are being projected by their tonality by the shitty tonality so honestly the reason I develop this program is because frankly I got sick of having to deal with this issue almost every time on bootcamp like before we even got into it so look I've got 15 years of experience teaching the game but I had literally zero experience teaching voice right my projection it's very good but I learned how to do this shit on the fucking streets yo okay meaning I didn't have the first idea about the actual science behind vocal projection of course beyond the old like conventional wisdom like I speak from the diaphragm you know stuff of that nature nor did I have the ability to quickly and efficiently transfer my vocal skills to others so it would be like trying to learn game from a natural you know who's good but doesn't really have the ability to explain what he's doing to get all his success so what did I do I partnered with Susan man's a professional vocal coach with over 40 years of experience to help me develop the curriculum for resonator and over the course of many coaching sessions she broke down the secrets that professional singers and speakers use to actually draw people to them almost magnetically and with this knowledge you'll be able to replicate that with this knowledge you can make your voice the ideal expression of who you want to be and you can showcase the exact characteristics of your personnel that you want her to see so what exactly is the science and what are you gonna learn well first you'll learn how to identify and release stress patterns in your body that are literally cycling your voice and preventing you from projecting in a clear healthy attractive tone you'll also learn foundational breath management techniques to give you clarity of intent to keep you grounded in the present moment even after bad rejections okay your breath is literally the fuel for your voice so we explore how to manage this vital resource and you're out in the club and after these basics we then get into the actual production of tone like I said before professional vocalists they know precisely how the various components of the physical apparatus work together in harmony in conjunction and they train to optimize them so here you're going to learn the science of your vocal anatomy so you know exactly what's going on physically when you're speaking now once we know how to actually produce the sound then we can start to play with different tools in order to modulate it in order to generate a more compelling charismatic and it is generally pleasing tone so you're going to see how different sounds are produced with different parts of the apparatus and we're also going to give you exercise to hammer this into your visceral understanding so the techniques become unconscious you'll also learn a variety of secrets to find your optimal resonance and I reveal the secret sauce that allows opera singers to be heard without using a microphone and this is called a ring mastery of this technique gives you a very distinctive very brilliant ringing quality to the timbre of your voice I've also created a series of vocal exercises on mp3 that you can engage with daily and you can listen these on your phone and these are techniques that are very easy to understand and they're going to be immediately beneficial now of course there's a lot more to it than all this but for now check out this preview clip and in it you're going to learn some of the secrets revealed by Susan as well as see some excerpts from a live event I did in Los Angeles where I ran the crowd through these exercises  [Applause]  holy all right Wow okay that was wonderful thank you thank you god bless you god bless america welcome to the wonderful our SD free tour Los Angeles always a pleasure to be here flew down especially for this motherfucking event this is basically our spiritual homeland the land of fake tits and real assholes we'll be joined shortly by our fearless leader mr. Tyler Durden aka Owen cook apparently he's the reason he's not here on time as he's getting a haircut I didn't know that you could cut that amount of hair but apparently it has a lot more to do with cutting the cutting of the beard you guys are a frisky bunch I like this shit the best crowds the best crowds but why tremendous tremendous believe me believe me we have the big artist he has the biggest crowd okay so I haven't put out a program since my getting your dick wet from the internet thing came out a couple years ago which was called execute the program and that was I poured my fucking heart and soul I left it all on the table I'm extremely extremely good at getting laid off the internet we're to the point where I would never have literally I would never have to go outside ever again you know between that and Amazon and Monterey you know i propped in you know post mates I'd probably be pretty good and then the pussy comes from the tenner or the bumble or what have you so I don't like to put stuff out unless it's like near and dear to my heart and you know I just want to crank out hits I want to make classics so I thought to myself what is on yeah you know that again I don't want to make hit so I want to make classics you know withstand the test of time so I really thought about this and going out and I don't know if you're aware this but our our schedule as RC instructors it's quite grueling you know every week we land in a city we do this event on our Thursday straight from here into bootcamp screaming at hose in the club and we're probably screaming more at the students than the proverbial hose but regardless screaming screaming screaming run the event all de anza on Saturday straight out to the club by Sunday literally I was often getting in cabs and the cab drivers like where do you go I'm like airport and I literally have to making like like a hand gesture so the Gaulle Airport they take you in you know Gosei Airport so I don't I'm not sure what kind of accent that was but I'm sure it's offensive to someone in here so um so I really started thinking about how to like keep this healthy long term because look man if our voice goes out that's like a strippers like tits falling off or something like I can't you can't it's their moneymaker you know I mean so it's deeply concerning when you start to have these kind of episodes every week and we have to have like a complete vocal rest on Monday we're literally I'm like not even talking the whole day if I want to say something I'm like writing it on like a whiteboard and carrying around my fucking girlfriend loved it it's like this is fucking great usually his mother fucker never shuts up right so she what she loved it but I did not love it so much so I started going to a professional vocal coach and you know this woman's been doing it her name's Susan Nance San Francisco she's been doing this for 40 years and so she's a dyed-in-the-wool professional I'm as we started to engage about this you know with her in this vocal training I realized that many of the things cuz as you can as you can hear her I'm pretty good at projecting my voice you know even you guys in the back you can probably hear me it probably less than I guys up front but still I know how to manipulate it in such a way that it'll carry so over the years I I kind of sucked out a mental map of what was going on with the vocal apparatus so it was very interesting to go to this woman and see what parts of that map matched up with reality and what parts of that map were completely off-base and I learned I learned so much from this woman I'm like you know what fuck it I'm going to make this into a program so that was the impetus for the program the resonator program so I realized this would be that now you might say okay great that's phenomenal how is valuable for pickup I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot hook the set 80% of the time this is the problem this is the fucking problem is their vocal projection now how many of you have ever gone up to a group of girls and you try to open them and they don't even fucking look at you I hate this when I see it I hate it I'd see this like and I feel so bad for these students because I'll time they come in and you know we're doing the pre Bri if I'm like hey man okay so tell me a bit about yourself your background yeah okay ah my name is Bill and I live in the fucking thing and I'm just yeah okay okay I can you speak up a little bit oh okay my name is Bill and I'm from the fucking ding and her beer and it's like he I'm like dude do it as loud as you can and he's like a bill and you're like holy shit he literally believes he's doing it as loud as he can I'm like yo dude honestly not to be a dick but if I can't hear you in like a relatively quiet hotel lobby how the fuck is these girls gonna hear you in like an in a loud bar a nightclub and then they go out and you know again inevitably they get this result they literally go up and the girls won't even look at them they might as well be this podium or this chest they're a fucking piece of furniture and I would just break my fucking heart to see this because it cuz I mean dude there's there something there's nothing even if they told you to go fuck yourself that would be better because at least they're acknowledging that you exist as a human being you know what I mean it's like so deep it's like dehumanizing but again it's all on them so I'm like alright this is what I'm gonna do so there's basically three components and I want you to think of it like a triangle okay a triangle or a pyramid if you will to want to get three-dimensional and by the way that's one of my new sort of my new statements of intent oh my girl I want to get three-dimensional with you and they're like what's that mean I'm like well I love this dimension I love this dimension I want to get in this dimension girl I just I just want to get three-dimensional girl right so bad another one I'm doing it's so dumb that's why I love it another one that I'm doing lately is that I do I look fucking mice and I'm like girl I'm like you don't even want to know what I'm thinking about doing to you right now and she's like uh what like you don't want to fucking know she's like what what girl I just want to I just want to get to know you over a period of several months meets your peer group and see if we have any commonalities maybe engage in those commonalities with them maybe an Ultimate Frisbee League or something getting a long-term relationship go meet your parents for christmas make a trip of it get into an even longer term relationship have some children together watch them grow up achieve their dreams hopes and aspirations have them move out of the house grow old together in our twilight golden years holding hands and die in love that's what I'll fucking do to you girl I'm playing around with Alan I'm playing around with that one and then of course telling them that I am a vampire wizard who is a master of numchucks who you know who drives a van called vampire Potter I told my buddy Evil Jimmy dies like more like vampire squatter lives in a van what fuck you so anyway we have the Pyramid the three dimensional pyramid at the bottom it is vocal projection okay now with vocal projection there's a whole host of things to go into it there's basically five things okay and the first one is MA it might not be what you think what do you think is the foundation of solid vocal projection what do you think that is I would say breathing but even deeper than that I even deeper that boom I heard right here your actual posture and I it was weird because you haven't heard of Alexander Technique I that was that her technique was something that was in vogue back in the early days of I think was one of the first things that actually Neil Strauss did was he was an Alexander practitioner now without a dander technique what Alexander Technique is it was developed in the 1800's by an Australian actor and this guy he was known for getting mono like Shakespearean monologues that was his whole STIs if you will and he noticed that his voice kept getting fucked up so he was investigating various causes for it and he arrived at the conclusion that it was all starting from his posture so when he developed Alexander Technique most people hear about that and they think oh it's just a posture technique to make you feel mark and appear more confident but actually what it is it's aligning the entire apparatus for optimal projection so that's number one there's your posture then comes the breath management right so if posture is the foundation breath is kind of the fuel of your voice so you need to look like a singer knows that they need to manage that very carefully right so we go through a variety of breath management techniques then the third is the actual tone production okay the actual tone production of what's going on here when you're producing the tone the pitch etc etc then there's something that's known as resonance now resonance is what affects the quality of the tone making it pleasing or unpleasant I guess and last not least we have what's called ring or singers formant which is the ability to project it this is why if you look at a guy like say you know Pavarotti the opera singer or any opera singer for that matter they are able to project in a law in like a big environment a big venue now granted the acoustics of that venue are probably optimized for that but they're also singing over what an entire Orchestra so this is what enables them to do that so again it's posture breath management tone production resonance and ring so that's the bulk that's the whole vocal apparatus that's that's the foundation on top of that I wanted to get into something else that I feel I get asked about a lot right a lot of people ask me Jeff do I get better at telling stories you seem to be a person that is very comfortable in that milieu you know it's very comfortable just rattling off stories that will at whim you know and having them actually be somewhat compelling and people are actually paying the fucking fuck attention to you so the fuck attention yes so again boom vocal vocal projection storytelling and then sort of the salt bay a little fucking spice on that shit is humor and the ability to be humorous okay so what I'd like to do with you guys right now is a simple Alexander Technique exercise and that's got to kind of run you through this and this is one of many that we're going to do so what are we all stand up okay and what we're going to do is we're going to do one of these exercise now here's the whole point of Alexander Technique what he realized is that the reason he wasn't able to project his voice as much it's started here it started at his head right right at the top vertebra at c1 vertebra and he called this the primary control and he found that what he was doing because he watched himself in the mirror and what he was doing he was he was putting his head down and back like this and this was affecting the way he was holding tension patterns in all of his muscles because what happens when you get into like a fight-or-flight mode you can tense up now normally this would happen you know in prehistoric times when yeah tiger saber-toothed Tigers creeping so much that's you either want to be very still or you want to be ready to get the fuck out of there so now granted today we don't have fucking Tigers chasing us down although if you're walking around downtown here at night maybe you do but um but but generally we've got mild stresses that that's the Seidel poison dripping we were talking about that's happening on a daily basis so then you go into the nightclub and then a girl calls you a mean name and you feel like a douchebag chode fucking loser and you go if you learn more of it and so now you see these guys shuffling around the Club the version walked as he said it's not subversion walk okay so but here's a big I just happened with every weekend I'll have a student and what is the number one rule of game and my information is this whatever you feel they feel so you want to put yourself into a state that the girls actually want to be in which is not not fearful anxious ready to flee a predator but but rather loose happy about life enthusiastic to be there so again I'll often be talking to a girl in the club and about who you here with oh my god I've got a couple friends here oh there's one of them and she look at the student and the girl actually said that's not to longer she's like what's wrong with him like it looks like he just found out he has asked cancer that's as you said he found out he has asked cancer so what we're going to do in how we do a short we're going to give you AB cancer you'll get ass cancer you'll get ass cancer you get ask you know we're going to we're going to do now is we do a releasing technique okay so the first thing it starts what he calls the primary control so that's up here so instead of having your head like kind of down and back you want to almost start off like almost like you're sniffing the air like there's some smell on the air like there's something baking or some sticky icky icky it's a bank like floating through the air pants like and just get it really loose so you know you could touch it here you could feel it very loose at the top okay now I want you to start to release okay start to release all tension you might have start with the traps just let it really breathe it out we're going to breathe it out the chest right let that drop the abdominals let that kind of just drop and be rested and and release any like holding patterns you might have any startle holding patterns you might have the quads out past the knees boom the legs the ankles okay again check that primary control again and now what we're going to do is this we're going to do a one side at a time you're okay so I want you to first take your hands put them at your sides straight down like this with the fingers pointing straight out okay turn them like that so palms are facing forward and then bring the palms out in front of you like this okay and rock back on your heels it's almost a counterbalance okay so rock back on your heels a little bit then I want you to bring both of your hands up here the fingers on the shoulders like this and we're going to start with the right hand and keeping the elbow bit you're going to bring the left arm down and the right arm up like this okay okay now you're going to bring the right arm down like that now you should feel and your back your neck all the way down on the right side it's loosened up okay now we're going to do the other side okay so fingers out forward out in front of you again up touch those tips there okay again like that and then release that one down okay boom now your whole back should feel a lot more open now go ahead and sit down so you feel as though you fell out it's like a lot more open right now look out look out simple that thing is right that's so simple and and you can do that anywhere right so there's a variety of exercises like this that we're going to be engaging with and the thing that I really liked about this program as I started developing it was that unlike a lot of other programs that we've done in the past I mean let's let's be real RSD a lot of our programs are very there's a lot of abstraction in them right there's a lot of sort of esoteric concepts this is just like a series of pretty basic exercises that you do and you can engage with on a daily basis so again I this corner your shit but it's probably the closest things the fucking magic pill you're going to get an rst cannon if you will so let's do one where you're sitting down to because you want it you want without zanter technique the idea is you want to have like a very confident neutral posture because the thing is a lot of guys they get the idea of of what you know I need to have a confident posture so what does that look like hey that's a super that's super confident but that by the way that's how we greet each other in San Francisco with like when you see your friend hey what's up dude hey right so yeah but again you know you don't want to be like because most guys are doing what like what's up what's like the default patterns again that head down back and like slouch right slouch or when you're sitting it's like the same thing it's very like my dad okay so we have to be on the word yeah it's down the edge of the chairs that's an important edge of the seat right because what we're going to do is we're going to work on getting you on your sit bones okay well you are on them anyway the sit bones are the bottom of the pelvis and they are rocker shape so you can actually rock on them forward and back so I'm going to we're going to engage the primary control first of all by finishing towards the ceiling there's another I thought you can do for this for bigger movements like what we're going to do now yeah and that is you can you know how dogs will sometimes push their gainer daschle across the floor yes so very slowly gently push your dinner dish a little bit towards the ceiling so forward and then up and then rock a little bit forward on your sit bones and push your nose up and rock forward on your sit bones and then you can relax your head a little bit on top of that okay and now you're on the middle of your sit bone okay yeah yeah it feels a little different than it usually yes does it feel like you have to hold yourself through maybe a little bit yeah okay so we're going to think now of releasing your legs and letting them and if you have little arrows going out your knees and then up away from your body so I'll just give you a feel of that okay that helped it a little yeah yeah okay now I'm just gonna this is what would happen in the lesson the teacher would put their hands on and give you an idea of how to line up even more okay but you get quite a lot just by directing your head and then rocking on your sit bones let's go back to relax slouch yeah yeah and then you're going to push your dog bowl forward and up and rock Wow Wow so that came from the head direction didn't it yeah nice hole then that rocks really it's really a curve in the lumbar just a little bit a little bit of it's actually pretty straight when I touch it yeah it feels curved to you cuz it really have to the other way exactly yeah it was actually straight straight yeah a curve would be that yeah so that's a big curve right that can actually be pretty relaxing sometimes too but yeah I'm never mashing those arrows coming out the legs they're releasing the quads mm-hmm then you're also releasing yes that's right in here you may see me so here then the shoulders the whole core tension and then the leg extension right as you're rocking forward and then the postural muscles take over and hold you up right what I want to talk about now is tone production so how does tone actually get produced in your voice by the vibration of the vocal folds so you got here a pair of like little labia in your neck okay that's that basically our piece of cartilage that come together and vibrate at various frequencies this is the thyroid cartilage right here it's the Adam's apple the larynx and the vocal folds are in there you can see this little Ridge here I don't know if you can see that but that's the vocal folds right there and above them is the false vocal folds didn't know them what they were there don't you've never heard about before the true vocal folds have a ligament in them and and actually can make you know tone like we make the false folds are to provide a like a double air lock okay so that food won't go down into our lungs when we swallow okay and they also can interfere with our speaking which we'll talk about in a minute now here we have a giant model of the larynx thyroid cartilage Adam's apple so this right here is literally Adam yes exactly okay so you can see that if this was a real person it would be enormous yeah a giant about my throat yeah so this is a tongue bone tongues attached here a huge tongue so this is the epiglottis and these are the vocal folds in here and the epiglottis there's tissue that goes around here and it gets pulled down like this when you swallow okay to keep the food from going into your lungs of hailing food yes so that's a 3d version of this now I'm going to show you this is from a pharmaceutical company that would put out these things for doctors so this is when the doctor here he is examines your vocal chords which is a little mirror you can there they are okay right and here's a bigger version of them this they're open and so that means you're breathing you're not making any sound when the vocal cords are open when they're closed you're either holding your breath or you're making sound in there vibrating so I see it's got two folds basically it's got the ventricular folds which are false chords and that has the actual folds which is the the true one okay once it makes sense those are the ones that are vibrating yes exactly so what's happening when when you get hoarse what is the actual damage that's happening this is laryngitis oh wow they're swollen edema yeah yeah so that can happen from being ill but also from severe abuse you know these are all so I'm just like this is probably what my boss's cords look like yeah he is all thinking you've got a variety of workouts of laryngitis and laryngitis simply happens when you know it's overuse it just swollen or when you get really sick okay now that will get inflamed so basically when so I'm going to do my fingers being the vocal cords yeah so there's like this in your neck the attached part together in front and they swing blows to vibrate to make the sound there's three ways you can this space between them is called the glottis the glottis that's called the glottis and so there's three different kinds of ways you can begin a sound you can begin it an aspirant onset by pushing the air blowing air through first and then closing them and that's like ah okay oh yeah like that and then you can do a glottal onset which means you close the glottis close the chords and then you put the air through afterwards ah like that like ah ah yeah yeah oh it's very American uh uh right right so a trigger for that is like uh or uh okay uh uh yeah uh uh yes you're stopping it yeah that's right and then there's a simultaneous onset which is used a lot in classical singing and I think we do it sometimes in speech and that's where the air and the courts the air happens at the same time that the vocal cords come together onset refers to how the tone begins production okay so we've got three things number one is what's called a glottal onset that's a glottal onset right so that's a glottal onset so the opposite of that in fact let's all do that now let's do a glottal onset okay ready  [Laughter] more like  okay that's one type of onset then on the opposite of the spectrum we have a where it's just open and it starts open and that's called an aspirant onset how many guys in here have watched the wonderful BBC series planet Earth on weed oh so it's yeah planet Earth - on weed don't sleep on that shit it's amazing that's like my go-to thing if I want to like put on a movie or whatever for for somehow you know wonderful time so think of the narrator of that the guy David Attenborough right that is what that is a prime example of a guy with an aspirant onset like no British person even sounds like this guy okay it's like the wahoos Lima of Malaysia he's born into a world of wonder and danger what this little creature would have to learn quickly if he is to survive in the jungle right it's very bizarre right very bizarre and then you've got what's called you know simultaneous onset now most of the time for like the most pleasing tone you're going to God want to go with what probably simultaneous simultaneous onset but you want to know how these things work learn to feel them so sometimes you do a glottal when would glottal be necessary when you want to foam like pierce through capture attention and be very kind of piercing right so it's like hi all right all right all right like in fact if I want to get the attention of a student in in the club I'll often do that because it you can hear it from far away and to everyone around it just sounds like I'm an Australian drunk okay which I mean they're always drunk so I mean that's neither here or there but you know III and it'll immediately pierce through  okay now when my I want to do a more aspirant onset yeah if I'm like saying some kind of creepy shit in her ear like what's up girl let's talk a little bit now about what's known as as wing that's what makes the boy scary model yeah I put an outfit on it it now has on the tissue and muscle that connects the epiglottis and the aeroccino cartilages it's called the aryepiglottic sphincter because it yeah yes that's what it is aryepiglottic snake that is I was going to make a judgement hose house is near of a hose around it yes the sneaker is better so tell me more about the air how do you said you get the area that extinct area epiglottis Pinker yeah this because this is the air at annoyed cartilages and it attached there this is just a cartilage mass around your this these things underneath it are the cartilage okay epiglottis and this is muscle and tissue okay epiglottitis comes down like that and this thing would you hold that from her see if I pull this string it makes this into a little bunched up thing like that that's okay show the camera it bunches it up like when you bunch up a paper bag so you're yeah okay and what that does is you can consciously control that yes you can and that happens when we swallow okay yeah that's what I we were talking about over and you can also do it when you're speaking or singing and what it does is it makes a narrower opening for the sound molecule sound waves to come out up like a hose you know a nozzle on a hose you can have wide spray where its watering little slowly yeah so let's say for example you know if I'm singing and you and you close that it's going to make it more of like a tight game yes as opposed to this just like baby spray that's right right so it's more powerful yes so this so when a lot of we're thinking about generating power a lot of times what they're doing is they're thinking that it's coming from the lungs or pure yeah but in reality you're modulating that power through to that and there are three levels sphincter that the resonance and then the air so it's the resonance and then that yes and then so that controls your ring yes okay interesting so do you have any uh generally want to go you make that noise is we've already been doing it but now we're going to do it on purpose um you can do it by thinking of things like a buzzer you know and making a buzzer noise like ah yeah that's it so all by itself is not very attractive no yeah this is not the the new method right you don't just walk up to people in the club actually that might work dunno it would make a Maya what are you having enough fun with it it could work yeah but it's very loud yeah so yes so there's a buzzer that's really good and then you can do like when children do yeah yeah yeah yeah right that's that - Nelson from The Simpsons yes that's that's that that's the road okay so to make it attractive though we keep the stuff we got from resonance so we have the loose jaw right and the larynx not too high okay and and then we have the ring in there so so we'll start with it really kind of is a little overwhelming he tells all I said okay but one of the reasons that the the ring needs the larynx to lower a little bit to make it attractive is because it's easier to make that ring sound with a high larynx you want to think of like a hose okay so if you have a hose on and you are actually just or another thing it's going to flow now what happens if you pinch the hose it's going to become a more piercing beam so this is what enables us to again as RC instructors of onstage project to the back of the room as pickup codes in the club enables us to boom give their attention very quickly and all this stuff comes together but so let's do this right now so well if you do it too much what happens it becomes unpleasant okay it almost sounds like um in fact close to just go now to soo ah  okay now go now let's go na okay now pinch that thing at the hotel na okay so it's got this kind of like nasal like you know Nelson from The Simpsons it's like haha right so you watch up again some of the exercise that we do in the program are designed to help you find the exact amount so you want to do it so where it's unpleasant and dial it back additionally when we're talking about what's called resonance we've got a lot of exercises dealing around articulation of various vowels because various vowels sit in various places in your mouth okay so you're like who so like the E is pronounced up here the a ooh oh okay go e e yo that's up in the front I go ah yeah that's more in the back could you feel that's more in the back of the of the palate okay and then oh it goes down here and it's like Oh  oh yeah yeah right so when you're aware again when you're aware of how these different vowels need to be it's using produced in which area of the mouth it allows you to project them in a more pleasing tone let's take a couple of deep breaths okay now let's see how the breath goes when you're not controlling it properly when you're not managing it properly okay so I want you just go like this ah and just feel all the breath come out all the rest amount okay right so again if you're not managing the breath correctly you're not gonna have enough power and you might not be able to say long sentences with power or hold it for a long time hold a note for a long time for example so thinking not from the diaphragm but you're going to be constructing contracting this whole band around your midsection now let's let's do like this I just want you to hiss the air out okay and think of this as constricting okay so it's going to take a lot longer doing that to get an entire breath out right so now let's doing that with transition into an AW with that okay so ah  it's again just don't don't hold the note just like just like like this ready I'll do it first ah  ah go again you've got a lot more breath control there okay ah okay so now while we're up here let's practice the glottal onset okay so press hi  okay now do an aspirin onset oh okay now let's go for let's go for a simultaneous onset here okay ah  so now there's some things we can do with pitch control - I want you guys to be able to find your optimum pitch now we're going to look for your optimum pitch speaking pitch okay sort of central place that you can go up and down from right so how we do that is we sing it go singing down and find the lowest note you can sing it sounds kind of good so sing on this note that's almost a more individual thing I actually will put a pin in I'll talk about that in a second so now I want you to think about bouncing it off of that hard palate okay so now bring it all together so we're going to saw saw okay we're gonna do a simultaneous onset and then we're going to we're gonna do an AA and we're going to bounce it off that hard palate okay so it's like Oh  Oh  okay all right sit down give it some ham so um can I get let me get um bug so anyway so long story short obviously it's a lot more involved with that I just wanted to give you guys a taste we've got a lot of different exercises in this program that you can engage with on a daily basis just mp3s - they're going to pitch play ring play articulation play to get that you can listen to before you go to the club and the great shit about this is this you guys know how skills are built how it feels know this is in the brain how our skills actually created myelin myelin cheating okay so neural pathways the more you engage with a particular skill it's going to build unlike a mutt what's called a myelin sheathing around those particular neural pathways which essentially acts to make that connection faster so the more you engage with skill the better the quicker you're going to get better at it right so with speaking we do that every single day and you've probably been doing it ever since you came out of your mother's womb all right you know screaming bloody murder or what have you so those pathways are already there so it's a matter of two things number one letting the bad habits go fallow and number two starting to build those neural pathways and again they're mostly already there but you just got to learn the correct thing to do and it comes very very quickly so again that's the bot that's the Foundation's a pyramid so tomorrow he'll be back with another video this one going over the practical application of all this science to your game aka how you can actually use this new superpower to actually grab attention to hook the set and actually get fucking laid right so finally sign up for the VIP extra is to become eligible for an awesome goodie bag of bonuses that I've cooked up just for those on the list and this is going to include a free day of Vegas immersion as well as access to the 3 resonator gold live events that I'll be doing and these are going to be some epic sessions much like the clip from the event that you just saw where we're bringing guys up we're going to pinpoint their issues and fix them in real time so you could go out and you can project and resonate with women that very night and if you're unable to actually attend these events lives they're also going to be uploaded so you can watch them at leisure in your own home from the comfort of your own home now remember these bonuses and more okay will only be available if you get a copy of the program through the links on the VIP list so take a quick minute right now and sign up by clicking the link below at RSD resonator dot-com and when you sign up for that VIP list you're also going to get a download link for the resonator theme song immediately sent to your inbox do it do it I'll see you tomorrow okay so let's do a quickie little breakdown on what happened there and now it is time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the set set set set 80% of the time this is the problem hey hi freeze motherfucker a good evening he doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him so why the fuck - fuck should she this is the roof of the mouth right here oh right yes [Music] smelling something nice touching shoulders ah that's the touchdown right they're not just being loud but being clear so this dry sometimes people will say what they heard you they heard the noise good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps with cheese and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding that was good so  unflinching in here in order to yeah and that's what we don't want ok this we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow they're swollen this is probably what my boss's cords look like and to be a dominatrix anytime what the fuck you talking about oh I'm like literally cringing she was like my voice tone was like oh like I have above-average but yours is like baby [Music] yes don't do this don't mix it down shut up blip blop dealer to get down here down here job yeah yeah you're dumb your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a to mate we're we're telling stories do you want to be more excited or do you need to be more like calm and collected and that will change often dynamically during the interaction itself it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of long-term help for your voice you're going to be able to go out and take your finger like this and push it push it and then what and not weird and so weird to think when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I truly believe that it's only a matter of time until they like I'm home and now victus above the a provide family gave me a huge awareness of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicality behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling and humor but on a personal note father like hello Dalai Lama am i right that you know some little act and that's mostly quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game contest as like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself Jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve we're so so so long [Music]  you  [Music]  [Music],YkbyTbUl0DE

Jeff real social dynamics and today it feels like a massive weight has just been lifted off my shoulders for I have just finished production on execute the program version 2.0 so what is execute the program 2.0 well ETP 2 is a fully updated program representing a far more evolved and new understanding of the online game and this has been brought about not only by my extensive experience in the year and a half since the original release but also from my helping most has common problems using the system during that time as well as some very advanced problems as well so ETP 2 is the online dating guide that gets you laid period let me take a little minute to explain exactly how this version came about now when I envisioned the original execute the program I wanted it to be the most comprehensive resource on online dating in existence and to that end I researched the material for the program for close to three full years and in that time I sent thousands upon thousands upon thousands of messages and I went on something close to a thousand dates and of course I slept with well over a hundred girls off of OkCupid and tinder and after that I then exhaustively chronicled all this and assembled all the information into a coherent package and that was ETP 1.0 like I finished it I looked upon it and I saw it was good right I basically then kicked my feet up and I just waited for the reports to come in for guys who are using the system and over the next few months something amazing began to happen people in the online Facebook mastermind group were actually taking the ball and running with it and these guys were like improvising their own shit on top of the original ideas and fleshing out the original ideas and tactics even further and of course along the way everyone was getting laid like crazy myself included but um as I said originally there were zero plans for an ETP to write because it took so damn long basically it took so fucking long to create the first one that I was like you know what this is it I'm done with this shit right this is this is my I left it all in the field so to speak right but as the months wore on it soon became apparent that there was enough new material to actually warrant a new module that would not only further clarify the original program but also build upon it in a way that truly provided massive value so here we are now over the next several days I'm going to be releasing video previews that are gonna show you exactly what's new and furthermore you're gonna use be able to use the tips in these videos to actually start getting laid tonight and just like in ETP one we're first going to talk about your profile okay particularly the pics and the content the next section goes deeper into the messaging process way way way deeper when I say deeper I mean way deeper because this was the area that people seemed to have the most questions about after the original program came out and so the the messaging section in ETB ii was turned out to be the longest and it's got a lot of explanation of the underlying principles governing the message game okay after that I get into the phone game and take a look at a bunch of new case studies illustrating those concepts and for the new upgraded date section I wanted to do something really special so again in in that section first I talked about the structure the overall mindsets of the meetup the execution of the meetup and of course strategies for the endgame and then of course I have fresh brand new infield of full dates from open to close and one of these is actually from a student who of ETP who went on the date and I recorded it and then I sit back and critique the entire date with him in the studio then after that I've got three full brand new dates where I met girls out for threesomes of course right so there'd been a few questions about how to setup threesome dates off the internet and since I was tandem hunting in real life with great success already I was like shit fuck it what the hell let's try it out so you're gonna see how my process evolved there to be very consistent and furthermore I've also got a killer surprise bonus for you guys at the end of the week that you're not gonna want to miss so be sure to opt in to the VIP list or the link below as I said I got a pretty awesome surprise the end of this video series and furthermore by opting and you're gonna know exactly when the next preview comes out so go opt in right now and I'll see you tomorrow before then I'm gonna leave you with a quick clip from execute the program 2.0 so check it out while our methods of picking up girls on the internet have become more sophisticated the girls have kept pace okay and this sort of like escalating technological war if you will and since tinder became such an absolute phenomenon you know the girls by this point they fucking seen it all right so you know if if you want to get a good illustration of this I'd recommend you look up an essay on the internet it's actually titled the dick anomic sub tinder okay and for all intents and purposes all the the message is this for the average girl online dick is abundant and low value allow me to repeat that dick is abundant and low value and in fact to get a little glimpse of what they're experiencing let's just take a quick look at this this is something that was posted on the group about some random app called meet me so imagine if OkCupid had a facebook like interface that allowed you to see what these guys are actually messaging the girls so for example here we've got this is just like a profile pic like some random dude like literally doing everything that he can conceivably do wrong shit here we go amber you dumbass you never responded I gave you my number twice away this is the reality of a hot girl online if you want to see a little more of this check out these messages that a female friend of mine actually sent me detailing her experiences with creepy desperate guys who get butthurt when she doesn't respond right here she says in the past I deleted my facebook Messenger cuz I have a ton of people I don't know blowing up my notifications on my phone all because they want to have an argument with themselves lol keep in mind I have to go through every one of them to make sure it's not a business metro but filtering takes time kill myself right so here we've got like some guy sends her a message tries to call her on Facebook twice and then when she doesn't respond says why are you foul towards good people did God not connect us out of 8 billion I'm from the bay and lived in Hawaii you're from Hawaii and lived in the bay I never did nothing wrong to deserve this it's like again the sense of a title made it's pathetic here's another one hey girl how are you I want to know you if you want no response hey talk to me no response hey talk talk or go I block you well I'm sure she's fucking killing herself over that right here's another here's another one the extremely long-winded I'm not going to bother with the typical approach you're so hot baby I can give you this data data but I'm just gonna be myself and then he proceeds to have like a 10:00 message dissertation about his entire fucking life story and including leading with how much money he spends at VIP but he don't do that anymore cuz now he's a he's a good guy right fuck here's another one just out of the blue you're so desperate to be famous it's embarrassing deleted again like I'm sure she gives a fuck bro right and again like here we're like asking her about to explain a little further about these guys I'm like what happened with that one did you just mess you out of nowhere or did you have interactions with him before she's like I deleted him cuz he asked to pay me three g's for a good night out if you know what I mean I have a lot of them who i erase or just ignore and they cussed me out most of the time LOL and dude this is probably the most pathetic one of all the guy like I guess he hooked up with her one time and then she's like he's trying to hook up with her again and she's like hey you know sorry I've outgrown meaningless hookups otherwise I probably be down and she's like I get you the guys like I get it what about once more for me please you are so sexy I have daydreamed about you I even masturbated to the thoughts of when we did it I just wanted one more time no bullshit it's like what the fuck does duit expect is gonna happen you know ok sure bro so so again this is the fucking reality that where you're having to get that the girls contending with now yes is it fucking pathetic sure but remember ultimately this is a good thing because we can leverage this phenomenon to make ourselves stand out by the execution of proper game so consider this a fucking PSA from the executor general alright I told you motherfuckers I'm on some of that Michelle Pfeiffer shit from Dangerous Minds y'all like if my communication style it's a little brusque at times it's because I'm here to improve your game not to be you're like super cool friend who's who fucking loves you like I'm not like nice this rock star in the world Dave Grohl okay in fact if a guy is doing some dumb shit I'm actually doing him a disservice by not bringing it to his attention preferably in a way that gets them pissed off enough to actually take action and change it so look before we dive into it the last thing I want to see is this the best way to internalize all this stuff you know cuz I know it's a lot of information it's hours upon hours of info but the best way to internalize it is to watch the program all the way through and take detailed notes on the core concepts right the program's brilliance lies in its macro concepts not its micro concepts and that means like the little the lines and you know the little turns of phrase and stuff like that it's more the macro concepts so watch the entire thing through and it will literally program your brain into thinking like a fucking gangster pimp so without further ado let's boot up execute the program version 2.0,ZuoHWVRs1w4
yo yo yo what up is your boy Jeffy with real social dynamics and welcome to a preview of my brand new Chevy hot Co transformational experience it's a full day of hidden camera and field pickups with live instruction breakdown followed by a variety of very intense change work exercises that are designed to grade the lessons of the day into your teeth visceral understanding so what my friend Tyler put out his hotsy transformational experience last year I got to say I was a little wary okay however after attending several of his events myself I actually saw the incredible value of this type of work and now I'm fully onboard and not a lot of people know that I'm actually doing these exercises now so what I wanted to do was put out a couple of videos here just to let you know that now I'm basically the biggest champion of this type of change work and furthermore to show you what I'm bringing to the table in the revamped Jeffie hot seat transformational experience a lot of times though even though guys realize they could do it they go out they don't do it why do you think that is I'd say it's deeper than anxiety it this is like on upon a bootcamp even like for example I have a guy and I'll say ok I saw on that set you made X error instead do Y and that will get the result okay go and imma do you understand he goes yes I understand and he clearly seems to understand and then what do you think he does same dumb shit he did before what's going on there it makes me think after teaching for like 13 years maybe you know what I mean maybe this shit doesn't work are these guys stupid they're not stupid what's what's the problem why aren't they able to execute there's a whole lot of shit going on it's like emotional blocks so that's what the second part of the program is aimed towards and that's why you know rst is moving towards not just throwing out techniques and like okay here's the techniques now go do it it's getting to the core of the shit that's blocking you from executing okay because again you can know all the techniques in the world but until you like on a visceral level understand what's happening when you go out there an attempt to execute and you're like being influenced by social pressure among a number of other things and and moreover how to start to crack that shit off like chisel it the fuck off and free yourself from that influence you're not gonna have as much success now can we do that in like a couple hours no it's not again it's not you're you're gonna like come out of your chrysalis a beautiful flutter fly and it's problem solved three hours all receive fucking in the session but we are gonna plant the seeds of that okay I'm gonna plant the seeds of that so and again this is where that transformation is going to going to take place so you watch the videos that kind of gives you the context it gives you the techniques and then what the exercises are gonna serve to do is kind of ingrain it hardwired in your consciousness so even if you don't remember every single little technique that you see up here you're going to be able to go out and actually you know achieve similar results as us okay so again every single technique that we teach it falls under one or another overarching principles that like kind of is an umbrella and if you understand that principle very often you will be able to arrive at the technique of your own accord or a very similar technique that accomplishes the same the same goal so again so for example when you see up there when things go wrong in the interaction I'm able to be very calm okay when I pull the girl I'm extremely straightforward about it there's no hemming and hawing and I'm moreover I'm very nonchalant about it and she just comes with she just fucking comes with because it seems so natural it's just like of course she's gonna go with me why wouldn't she right and what does that come from it comes from we call hitting that sweet spot of the techniques what does that mean you think to hit the sweet spot of a technique  well specifically means this you're not just for sunny because like a lot of times I'll have students and I'll tell them to say literally the same yeah that's wrapped up in that I'll say I'll be like say I want you to say literally the same thing that I just said verbatim right like what's up one favorite opener of mine good evening I'm the next idiot of the night speaking with you or am I the first do I have the honor of having been the first idiot of the night to speak to you but like no Mike you probably will be the last either anyway what do they do hand on the lower back you're beautiful right so again with why do I like that opener so much because it's playing with a meta awareness of what the girls going through so when I say that it's like okay this this guy gets what the fuck is going on he's not like one of these other desperate fucking Schmucks so that's a great opener but then I tell a guy to go up he's like hello I'm next idiot of night and there's like what the fuck they're like what the get the fuck out of here fuck off right and and so again he's saying literally verbatim the exact same things I'm saying but what do you say if the sweet spot is understanding why it works right understanding deeply why it works and then furthermore that allows you like kind of like you said in the middle you know how much throttle and how much to back off of it and just win like when am i starting to go too much with it and like drop it move on to something else so again if you're just like technique man deploy deploy deploy you're gonna have limited success you might have better success and if you just went up and weighed your beautiful hand on the lower back right maybe but but again it's and tell you like internalize that shit so watch the videos today kind of through the context of today is the day I want to affect this change in myself okay so we're gonna leverage that group dynamic that we have here how many guys are in here right now about 50 60 dudes something like that it came I can't count but yeah there's a lot of people here and we're gonna leverage this group dynamic to catalyze that change it's gonna be a shit show it's gonna look totally stupid when I first saw this stuff when I saw Tyler like doing this stuff back in December and I first attended the first couple I was like okay we are officially a cult now we've we've done it we've crossed over colty top we need a weird hat maybe or some shit but a bunch of dudes jumping around it's funny too because like sometimes the hotels people will be like what's going on in there but no one ever comes in can you imagine the conversation at the front desk like something's going on there the screaming of shit go in there and check on it bill fuck that man I don't get paid enough for this year you will fucking in and check on it it's like 60 men like screaming so so again what we'll do we'll get different guys up here we're gonna show you little nuances little exercises that are going to kind of highlight those nuances and then we're gonna make a little tweak on these certain leverage points and you'll see how the change is made and then again and we understand this from years and years and years of doing this so we're gonna make little tweaks see how the guy's behavior changes make another little tweak to kind of peel back these layers of shit that have been like piled a hunger your psyche will show you how to communicate in a powerful way like get into the girls reality then we'll show you how to do it without being as forceful we'll do things like how to free flow hopefully what we're doing with the exercises we're showing you how to handle social pressure so when you're out there in the club you know doing daygame wherever the case may be and you see that happening to you you recognize it and you have tools to deal with it and you don't just get stifled you don't get put in your head we're gonna give you the tools here you're gonna have to go and practice after we're gonna plant those seeds here today okay so and that's really I think really that's what the core of RSD is about it's and that's why a lot of people gravitate towards rst who aren't even necessarily super into pickup which is kind of weird to me but you know I think really what it's about is learning how to consistently be at the cause end of things in the environment as opposed to being at the effect end of things right and again I think that really is ultimately kind of one of the big messages of RSD so that's the type of work that we do with the hot seat and the change work portion of the event is very very very intense basically by the end of it everyone's sweating they're fucking exhausted and I want you to understand that this is only for you if you're very very serious about making a change in your life okay like if you just want to spectate you can watch our YouTube videos you're good dog okay but this this program this is for when you're ready to take fucking action and change now a lot of people that watch our YouTube videos might think you know is there more to this is there more to rst and there is the next level if you like our teachings is this program it's our most popular program it's the hot seat and it's a full-day program that's meant to push you with a very crystal clear understanding of what we teach so you know when you see me make youtube videos a lot of the time just kind of shooting from the hip you know I'm improvising but the hot seat is very different because it's a very very set curriculum that's how countless interations iterations since 2008 to see what created the most change okay so this is our top material and rst this is what we teach this is what the people who are really getting engaged with us and who want to take it to another level is the course the hot seat and of course like all RC programs it comes with a one month money-back guarantee so if you come to the event and you don't execute what you learn afterwards you know you make it a shelf help as Tony Robbins used to say if you don't use it it's fucking pointless but if you're ready to change and you're ready to take action after the program I personally guarantee this will be one of the most rewarding and transformative experience of your fucking life so if you're an action taker go to Jeffie hot seat comm right now and I'll joy seeing you at the hot seat when you decide to get started,_1_Vr1ZyPNw
[Music] good day boys and girls this is your good friend and confidant Jeffy coming at you today from Calgary in Alberta Canada running a little boot camp up here as you can see behind me a lovely weather this time of year rather be here during the Stampede but that's another story I had this lovely shot all set up then I was going to shoot this video blog with and I set up yesterday when it was a much nicer weather and you had the entire scene of the Calgary downtown buildings and the Calgary Tower rising up in the background and I said okay great you know I'm kind of tired today so I'll just put it off and I'll do it tomorrow so I go to that safe spot today to actually do the shoot and as it turns out little little snow storm going on here and you can't even see the Calgary Tower so it just goes to show never put off until tomorrow that which you can do today make hay while the Sun shines literally and that not only goes for making video blogs which I'm sure everyone does but for approaching you know when you're doing cold approach pick up you're out at the bar you see that girl what's the first thing that happens when you see a girl you like you're like huh huh what a book right but then what's the second thing that happens if you do not take immediate action rationalizations start to form two-digit well she's within people uh you know what will I say I need to think of something something good to say I'll wait till those people leave and then I'll go it so I'll have a better angle of approach it's like look it's never gonna be better later okay like washing the fucking dishes it's never gonna be better later just wash the goddamn dishes right after you use that before it crusts up okay because chicken crust up in the field like that for example say you're like oh I'll wait till you know the people leave more people could come right or more likely she'll probably just leave then you're asked out because you didn't approach a lot of times you'll talk yourself out of it like we're looking at warmed up yet who gives a fuck the frame that we like to employ is that of unlimited chips okay unlimited chips meaning imagine you're staying at the you know a casino you're at the the Wynn casino in Las Vegas and Steve Wynn himself comes up to you and says sir congratulations you have been selected to have unlimited chips in my casino for the duration of this weekend you're like yay would you give a shit which which games you played would you try to be like well this one has better odds so I'll play this you won't even care unlimited chips to play whatever the fuck you want so that's how it is with the girls you know really this cold approach you basically have nothing to lose and everything to gain my mentality is if I see some hot girl in the beginning of the night and I'm like oh I'm not warmed up who gives a shit there will be a million more coming through all right so just hit it up but anyway that's not what I wanted to talk about today with this this little blog today I it's interesting because here in in Calgary the drinking age is I believe 19 or 18 it's a teen age it is a teen age and as such we'll go to these clubs here like one of my favorites is Cowboys another favorite is Roadhouse because it reminds me of the 1987 film starring Patrick Swayze of the same name in which he plays Dalton the best bouncer in America who was called down to clean up a dirty Roadhouse and hijinks and love ensue and murder and zen pain don't hurt but anyway so you know anyway I'm out at these clubs and there's these teeny boppers running around and some of them have fake IDs and they might even be 16 all right I'm a 36 year old man all right so I might find myself hooking up with teenagers like the other night I boot camp literally last night couple hours ago I hooked up with a girl who was literally half my age so that kind of got me to thinking I wanted to do a little blog here on the topic of age and learning the game at different ages okay learning the game coming into it as an older guy versus a younger guy now personally I think that I started learning this stuff in earnest when I was when I was 26 years old that's when I discovered the you know the community as it were and I began studying this stuff in earnest and I kind of think that that's the perfect age for guys to get into it and I'll tell you why I think that if guys you know the perfect age is probably about between 25 to 35 and I'll elaborate why when you're younger under 25 you know that's that age when you're kind of finding yourself and you're sort of working out what your identity is and as such people come to younger people tend to gravitate toward specific cultures and embrace it as an identity for example like in high school the kid who becomes the goth kid and he starts hanging out with that subculture and his dress changes to reflect that or you know they didn't just really into some kind of band or they become like a jock and they get they do get really into sports so they become like a hip-hop guy etc etc and their whole identity begins to sort of morph into that alright so the danger win I got studying pick up at a young age is that he'll adopt pick up guy as his identity and then what's going on is you'll see a lot of very strange like antisocial almost behaviors start to pop up you know those days like I don't give a fuck what anyone thinks of me and this and that and then it just becomes their identity it consumes their life so they have no other interests aside from pickup you know some Songer guys on program them like so tell me what do you do well I'm a student oh cool what are your hobbies in your spare time pickup you don't like you know any sports or you're not interested in any you know play music and pickup I go out and invariably these are the guys that tend to be very sporty socially calibrated and often you know the borderline Asperger's cases so like a self induced Asperger's by gravitating towards pickup so that's one danger for a guy coming into a younger another kind of thing that tends to work to a younger person's detriment is the fact that they simply don't have a lot of depth to them right they don't have a lot of life experience and they do not have a lot of depth so it's all surface so they kind of kind of hinders in many instances their ability to just have that million-dollar mouthpiece and just just just spit spit spit spit spit spit spit like myself you know I've been around the block a few times okay I'm no spring chicken here and so I have a lot of experiences and I have a rich like depth of experience that I can draw upon when I'm conversing with people to relate to them you know to Endicott and to get a deeper connection with people so that's that kind of the pitfalls for a younger guy now an older guy on an older guy you know say over thirty-five like myself it's like his identity is pretty much he's not finding himself anymore okay after 35 your identity is pretty much like rock solid okay um like for example myself it's like I pretty much know what I'm about at this point like this is me it's not going to change anytime soon at least barring some sort of catastrophic miracle that caused me to reevaluate my entire life you know like a Saturn return but I've already had that if you don't what that is look it up it's kind of an interesting concept basically like a neat you deep into it it's around like the age 27 to 30 you go through a change in your life where you you evaluate the value systems and the beliefs that you've been holding and carrying through your life up to that point and really really weighting them and in many is making dramatic changes this happened to me when I went to Spain and I you know I lost a bunch of weight and I kind of became a more positive person more mellow let go a lot of anger issues and stuff like that but but anyway um so at this point it's like yeah this is me it's not going to change anytime soon so if you don't like it fuck off basically what I'm talking about here is the older guy is less prone or less susceptible to having his self-image affected by the kind of vicissitudes of the environment like some girl tells him you're a ding-dong you're a dummy he's like a black hole fuck oh shit or he's not gonna be like Oh disrespect and get all butthurt about shit he doesn't give a shit like he knows that you know he knows that it has zero effect on his life in reality has zero tangible effect in his life what other people think about it's kind of funny uh there's a saying I heard recently it's like when you're young you're concerned about what other people think about you when you get you're middle-aged you no longer care about what people think about you and when you get your old age you realize that nobody was thinking about you at all the whole time so but anyway so again that identity it's more solid again it's less prone to being affected by people's opinions etc etc however the the problem is what if your your identity is rock solid but what if your identity sucks it's a lot more difficult to change okay like again identity is a it's a it's fluid but it's a slow-moving fluid and the older you get the more calcified it tends to become like the younger guy he can make snap changes in identity and in his behavior in his personality relatively quickly as he's still kind of sorting it out but if the older guy put the older guy it's gonna be a bit more of a difficult road to hoe so to speak on the other hand the older guy he does have a lot more depth to him he's got a lot more rich tapestry of experiences to draw upon for example I had a guy I had gotten program this he was I believe he was near sixty and this guy came on program and he it's very interesting because I didn't know he was a student at first I walked into the lobby to meet the students and I looked at this fellow and he is rather portly with a push Wade a nun ironic push broom moustache grey hair these glasses this kind of tweed coat with like patches on the elbows like a college professor would wear very not really kind of the typical bootcamp student and I'm like oh you're on the program I'm like okay so what are your goals he's like I would like to have sex with 22 year old women that's my age demographic I'm like okay um well you know we don't want to be outcome dependent here but but we'll do our best right not trying to not get his hopes up but as it turned out we went out in the field and this guy just killed it you know and on the second night he went home with in fact a 22 year old Pilates instructor it's pretty crazy too because he was uh you know this and that thing is this guy he had an answer for everything you could say anything and this guy he's very very charismatic he's a stage performer professional hypnotist been on television and stuff so he's very charismatic he just did not know how to how to execute a cold approach pickup so give him a couple tips he ate it up he internalized it he had massive success and in fact after the program he's always sending me pictures of like his latest girls and stuff and they're all like hot young girls it's pretty amazing it really blew my mind and kind of really eliminated any last lingering doubts about like the looks issue or the age issue in fact you know that the girl that I hooked up with the other night you know she's 18 and and she's like how old are you in like 36 almost 37 like how old are you she's like huh I'm embarrassed she was embarrassed about her age I'm like oh she didn't want to tell me her age and I was like you ever been with it you ever like you ever hooked up with the old-ass man before she's like yeah it's hot go figure now of course not everyone's gonna share that opinion but it just goes to show again it's all about stepping properly I can't control it to people's opinions I can control my own behavior and I step in the appropriate manner you win some you lose some that's the name of the fucking game right but I probably go home with someone on any given Sunday or Saturday as the case may be but again so anyway back to the story this guy Dave was his name this older gentleman and he like he just had this rich rich depth in fact on the second night you know you know any I was listening in on his conversations winging them and anything you said to this guy he would have some fucking story to relate it to it you could say to him oh Nigeria and he'd be like oh yes Nigeria in 1972 I took an expedition to Nigeria with my good friend Mombasa and we encountered the local did it like some fucking story he'll have some story he's been alive a long time like that's the advantage for four guys our age like you know 35 not like we live a long time and we have a lot to draw upon to kind of like really there's a lot of depth to it like there's a lot of depth to our interactions because we actually have depth so um there's actually funny I was about to swan a kind of tell a story of how the guy got laid on the second night he he was he went up to the the 22 year old and Pilates instructor and I was kind of listening in by a pillar like kind of letting my ear and at one point the girl says to him um so are you gonna buy me a drink and he says I'm sorry my dear but I don't buy drinks for women until after they fucked me I'm like holy shit I'm like this fucking guy man well the balls on this dude and then the chick looks at him and I'm kind of like ja ja to Mike and the chick looks at him she's like oh I'm gonna fuck you he's like very well my dear what will it be and we'd like Pais to drink and then they're like five minutes later I see him walking out of the Clift hotel together hand in hand he comes back the next day I'm like what happened he's like I made love to her I'm like awesome dude I can awesome so so anyway just to recap and wrap up here younger guys getting into the game and old guys getting into the game you know when I say that I mean guys under 25 guys over 35 you know I kind of think 25 to 35 is that sweet spot where you have kind of you're starting at the benefits of both and the pitfalls of both are kind of like on the fringe but under 25 guy you know it's not saying that if you're if you're under that age you're over it's hopeless absolutely not but these are just some pitfalls that you should probably be aware of for the younger guy number one be very wary of allowing pickup to consume your life so you become this weird pickup guy with no other interest it's extremely counterproductive it's a terrible terrible identity to adopt for many many reasons if you if you want you know some elaboration on that I look up Tyler's video uh about the pickup batting average it's very very relevant to what we're talking about here very germane to what we're talking about here and secondly to develop you develop that depth well stay alive longer don't get hit by a bus okay stay alive longer try to have a rich you know a rich array of experiences travel you know broaden your horizons be open-minded to try new things okay and then just to stay alive longer and you keep keep chipping away at it's not to say that you should a shoe pickup entirely until I turn until my 25th birthday or anything like that just be aware of it okay for the older guy you really need to be honest with yourself and be aware and take a look at where your identity is disempowering and really make a concerted effort every single day to move away from those disempowering thought and behavior patterns and identity patterns again the identity is fluid but it's a slow-moving fluid especially the older we get so you really have to continually apply the the pressure reply the the gravity to it you know make it go or to make it flow the way you want to go but again eventually you will get there have faith in the process and most importantly have fun with it is geppi i'm gonna be signing off going out to boot camp heading out for Roadhouse excitement possibly Cowboys wearing my Spartan gladiator Halloween costume it's actually Halloween week it's funny cuz I was out with it last night and girls are saying what's what is your costume I'm like sexy rapist I couldn't decide between slutty rapist or sexy rapist but eventually think sexy rapist sounds sounds cooler which has nothing to do with the costume whatsoever but I do like wearing a cape I always feel like seven my game is seven to ten percent better anytime I'm wearing a cape so bear that in mind that's another hot tip for you um and anyway that's about it see you guys later peace future confusion confusion confusion confusion,__lAaZOiCqo
hey what's up guys is Jeffy coming at you from Anchorage Alaska downtown Anchorage Alaska you see the the true yak mountain range behind me subject visiting my family and but I wanted to bust out a quick little video blog today kind of justify the trip so today what I want to talk about isn't an old quote but a good one from the German priest Martin Luther which I've said this quote before and it is how soon not now he comes never all right now I was thinking about this because last night I was actually out and I went out with my cousin and my my uncle and we're out at this bar this local plays Humpy's you know toss him a few back we're just chilling and you know lo and behold I see some some hottie walk by you know it's like tall curly hair big rock I'm like okay awesome let's step to her that's my first instinct right but then I kind of got I kind of got in my head a little bit and I was like well oh I don't approach because durp like my family's here and I don't want them to see me get blown out right so isn't that interesting how even after like ten years deep in this game I mean I don't give a shit but you know your ego kind of creeps in the back door and these in these strange little ways even after ten years deep so it's interesting to see to kind of relearn that lesson again of course the more i sat there then i was like well no i can't go because now I've thought about it too long and when I go up it'll seem contrived now and so okay so anyway as I'm hemming and hawing she the chicks just sit there by yourself straight up like perfect perfect approach sitting there checking her phone ten minutes past fifteen minutes pass I'm like okay I'm gonna do it in a little bit then she just gets up and walks the fuck out done gone so it's a it just reminds me I mean this is a lesson I've learned by I've learned myself hundreds of times thousands of times maybe over the course of you know all these years but sure enough was thrown in my face again and you it's like relearning the fundamentals okay so again when you see that girl your first instinct is to do what is to you go who want to fuck okay right but then you know the rationalizations will start to creep in but again how soon not now becomes never there's no time like the present whatsoever two-step action is always the answer alright cuz look you know we don't get every girl and I've said it many times before but it's good to reiterate this stuff you know I don't I do not regret like when I step up and I fail what I regret is is not taking action at all right so I mean shit like I don't even remember blowouts I and I know that sounds like hyperbole like I don't even remember them but it's true it doesn't even get written to the disk but what I do remember real clearly is in action you know again we don't get every girl far far from you and I'm fine with that what I'm not fine with is what if you know I want to go home think it you know with a I can go I can rest easy I can go to bed at night knowing that I actually took action however I don't take action I'll be kicking myself over that I mean I still remember this day the first time I ever went to Australia was 2004 and I was walking on the Darling Harbour there and I saw basically what amounts to my my perfect ten walking by and what did I do I was like again same kind of thing what derp derp derp derp next thing you know she's gone I still remember that fucking what is an eight years eight years later still taking myself over that so again remember action is always the answer as soon as you see step and because again there's no time it's not gonna be better later you know what I mean it's not gonna be better later so again I just wanted to reiterate that a quick little quick little video blog here pretty excited about this trip because I got an awesome hipstery hat I will be the envy of every tight pants PBR swilling hipster in San Francisco when I go back hit up some glaciers the other day in order to make myself more I see like a pimps heart but and that's about it shooting off to the Hamptons probably will hit you up with another another video blog then and see ya alright good done one take one take Timmy,a0qfj2m07Yo
what up Jeffy here in Amsterdam and this afternoon I'd like to talk to you about a little essay called self-reliance Ralph Waldo Emerson was an essayist and a poet who throughout the mid 1800s espouse and outline what are traditionally seen as the core American values individuality and freedom now in my opinion and I'm saying this as someone who truly loves living in the United States his ideas are desperately needed now more than ever given the prevailing direction of American society and quite frankly the world at large in his famous 30-page essay self-reliance Emerson says that genius results from the belief that what you feel to be true in your own heart has universal significance so when we perceive justice or truth we're not actually doing anything except allowing it to pass through us so when I was writing my book for example I didn't really stop to think about whether people who read it would actually like it I was simply striving to make it ring true emotionally for me and I knew that perhaps paradoxically this was the only way that it could truly resonate with others as well and this is what's meant when you hear the the phrase trusting your faculties and this is why spontaneity instinct and authenticity are so powerful and why trying to impress and or needy behaviors are perhaps the most unattractive characteristics of all when we actually meet somebody who's unencumbered by conformity and who's on their own path we find them deeply charismatic in part because it gives us hope that we could be that way ourselves right so anyway in the essay Emerson writes no law can be sacred to me but that of my nature good and bad are that names readily transferable to this or that I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names this kind of reminds me of the the Marilyn Manson lyric pseudo morals work real well on the talk for the week but you're selective judgments and good guy badges don't mean a fuck to me maybe Manson's an emerson fan actually it probably is given the fact that he's actually a fairly intellectual and well-read dude despite his crazy reputation or image or whatever but anyway what this means is that you must be true to yourself and ultimately value your own opinion yourself more highly than that of others now of course this doesn't mean you just run around acting like an asshole and be like will I'm I'm awesome right no it means you have to adhere to your own inner code which may very well be even more strict and demanding than that of the law or you know societal norms further Emerson claims that disability to be true to yourself above all is in fact the main distinction between great and merely average people at the same time he admits that this isn't an easy task especially when you're faced with the indignation of the masses when what he calls the brute force that lies at the bottom of society rises up against you and frankly this has never been more true than it is today right make one wrong move in society and with the internet you now can have millions wanting to destroy you in a heartbeat it's kind of like a force of nature like the ocean and as Emerson says in the essay one needs the habit of magnanimity to treat this as a trifle of no concern another idea that Emerson brings up is that of taking instruction from others so people we look to teachers and gurus for advice but ironically enough would often dismiss those very same ideas if we come up with them ourselves so to be a grown-ass man or woman you have to accept yourself and what you were given in life now of course there's nothing wrong with learning from someone else but when you do take the knowledge in but don't let that be the limit don't be afraid to go on and actually build upon what your teacher has shown you emerson wrote insists on yourself never imitate your own gift you can present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's cultivation but of the adopted talent of another you have only an extemporaneous half possession so be your own guru you can learn things from others but ultimately you're the one that has to decide how you're doing to embody those learnings yourself Emerson he he went on to actually found the transcendentalist movement a core concept of which was the belief that we don't have to be at the mercy of random life events you know the ups and downs of fortune something bad happens you think your life is over something good happens you think you know your happy days are here again well Emerson ends his essay by saying don't believe it nothing can bring you peace but yourself nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles now I've said it before on this channel in a decidedly less erudite video which you may have seen but I'll say it again here in conclusion be your own person be a real person become your best fucking self this is Jeffy please subscribe below and I'll see you next time on the chubby boat  you,a2rRj6KKwME

yo what up it's your proverbial boy coming at you today on Taco Tuesday and every Taco Tuesday with brand new content so if you like what you see on this channel please please take a moment to smash that like button and also to subscribe to my channel so you get notified every time I pop a new video out of my metaphorical womb so today I want to talk about something that's really near and dear to my heart or more accurately near and dear to my head and to be very specific near and dear to my ears and my eardrums and that's hearing protection when you're going out to nightclubs now I've been going out for 15 16 years with regularity like a couple times a week sometimes in the early days up to seven days a week going out to you know bars nightclubs loud environments where your ears are getting just blasted getting fucking finger blasted by the music on a regular basis now when I was younger I you know had a very cavalier attitude I was very almost nihilistic and hearing damage wasn't something that concerned me but as I got in my 30s I began to see sort of the cumulative effect of having my ears blasted like this on a regular basis and practically what would occur is after a boot camp I would go you know do the debrief whatever go back maybe I'd go back with a girl whatever but when it came time for sleepy time and the lights went out and I'm there in the darkness and it's silent and I'm trying to actually go to sleep I would hear this persistent little ring ring ring ring ring this high-pitched ring in my ears and of course this is what's clinically referred to as tinnitus which is again a persistent high-pitched ringing in the ear which is in fact indicative of damage being done to the eardrum being done to the delicate mechanism of your auditory senses so over time this can become a chronic thing where anytime that it's silent you'll begin to hear this persistent ringing and for some people it can get so bad to the point that it kind of drives them insane and I'm not sure if there have been any cases of people like killing them selves over tinnitus but you know maybe there have been again I don't know that for sure but for some people it becomes this just like awful reality of their new their new life like this is my life now it's always ringing so once I began to have these episodes if you will at the end of the night what I was trying to go to sleep and hearing this ringing I began to become concerned so I started to explore options for hearing protection in the club now over the years I've used literally every type of ear plug that you can conceive of so what I want to do right now is give you a breakdown of the options for hearing protection and the different prices price points and you can decide for yourself what you know hearing protection you want to use now it's kind of funny because I've seen this come up in forums and stuff like that and often times it's met with derision or ridicule from other people they're like well this is stupid I don't want to be a nerd in the club with plugs in my ears I don't care and I'm assuming that the people posting this are like very young men who can't even conceive you know they think they're immortal they can't even possibly conceive that this can become an issue down the line well I'm here to tell you it very well can be and it's something that's completely preventable and it has zero quantifiable effect in terms of your game like no girl is going to see you have ear plugs in and be like you use a bitch I'm not gonna fuck now if she if she doesn't fuck you because ostensibly because of the ear plugs let me tell you she probably wasn't ever going to okay if that that's you probably have deeper issues at hand if you will then the ear plugs so anyway having said all of that let me start to do the breakdown now the first most basic type of ear plug I like if you find yourself out at the club and you either forgot your earplugs or you simply don't have any and all of a sudden you're noticing that this music is becoming so oppressive that it starting to become painful to you you can actually forge and craft earplugs from items that are available in the bar my assistant does this what he'll literally do is he will get a bar napkin at like so and he will just like rip it up and he'll like wad it into a little a little thing like this and he will just like shove it in his ear like so now again this is obviously like the most ghetto I guess would be the word the most ghetto option I think it's fucking ridiculous to be honest my assistant does this all the time but it's like hey you know if you're a cheap ass and or and or again you forgot yours in a pinch this will work this will provide some protection you can do it anywhere right you can just grab grab a little bar napkin wad it up and put it in there at least that's gonna provide some protection now the next level up is gonna be the cheap-ass like foam earplugs like these guys here and these little ones I find that these a lot of times a lot of clubs you'll see they'll have like especially like EDM clubs or dance clubs when they play really loud music they'll have like a little Bowl for these we're like a little container where you can actually grab some of these and they're usually like individually packaged and little you know sterile unit but but again these are gonna be minimally effective and they look kind of ridiculous coming out I mean but but again these are better than better than the bar napkin but what I find with these they will prevent the damage but they also have a tendency to muffle everything including other people's voices so yeah it's gonna protect but it's you're gonna have a difficult time understanding other people and furthermore you're also gonna have a difficult time gauging the quality of your own voice and how loud you're actually speaking so again these better than nothing what I actually find these useful for is like when you're on in the airplane or if I'm trying to sleep you know I'm traveling or one of the assistants is like snoring or something these are good for that because like the way they compress like if I try to use my my actual earplugs that you'll see in a moment that they become uncomfortable over time especially my head's on like laying against something but these these will work in a pinch and they're extremely inexpensive so over to second-level the little foam foam guys here third level is going to be these and and this is my favorite brand they're called earpiece and these guys you can get them and links are going to be in the description below for all of these by the way and these are called ear earpiece high fidelity hearing protection and they get three plugs and it's kind of cute they come with a little little case you know a little carrying case your keychain so they don't get fucked up and here you've got a variety of different eye levels of protection that you can swap out the little plug inside of these so I believe here they have 19 and 14 and then 11 decibels protection and what these guys look like oops  now these as you can see they're kind of like a little vinyl like a flexible vinyl sort of bell shape with a with the core that actually is doing the hearing protection so just to show you what these look like when you put them in the profile is pretty pretty low right they're not going to be super noticeable and they do they work they work quite well I mean they work better than the then the little phone guys for sure and they're gonna provide a little chip protection and they're gonna have a tendency to attenuate the sound over the full spectrum so you're you're not going to get that as much of that muffled effect so these were written these are a really solid choice and these are gonna be these are gonna protect your hearing you're not gonna get that ringing at the end of the night and these are about if I'm not mistaken I believe these are 18 dollars so these are like the if you want to get serious about your plugs but you want to be economical about it the ear piece is probably the way to go to start out and the great thing about these if you lose them you don't really care that much because it's like 18 bucks whoop-dee-doo and you can get these on Amazon these are very good I like these I like these ones a lot I use these for many many years then I decided you know this since this is my profession this is my job I kind of owe it to myself to make the investment and get some of your plugs that are actually a little bit more legit if you will and so I looked around and then I found these ones and these are the what are these called the the Etta Monica research music Pro plugs and what these are this is very interesting and you can see they come in a little a cute little case here you can carry around and they look like almost like a hearing aid and if you can see here they're actually powered by a hearing aid battery and it just flips out a tiny little battery and cracks right in there so now again and these are electronic so you can actually turn these on and I've actually swapped out they came with a different style of actual plug that goes in the ear so I swapped it out with these comfort foam plugs and sees the left or the right I don't think there's much I don't think there's any difference you know you put them in like this and what these actually do these ones are interesting because they automatically adjust to sound levels and what they do is they also enhance the voices like there's different settings on this for different levels of cancellation so essentially they work like a white noise cancellation thing and yeah so what it does is it's blocking out harmful frequencies electronically and it's enhancing the voices of the people you're interacting with so these are actually pretty awesome they're quite expensive these are about $300 plus tax and again they need to be powered but when I've used these they've protected me very well like I had no problems even in the loudest environments I live in Miami omneya and Vegas like I had zero problems and you can hear other people quite well my only issue with these is they're quite bulky as you can see and they kind of MIT they kind of make you look like you're an Android perhaps from Star Trek or something like this or maybe like you're you're disabled like I actually have had multiple women me oh are you deaf are those hearing aids I'm like what no I have perfect hearing so they look kind of weird again that concern about I don't want to look like some dork these are the only ones where that might actually be sort of a legitimate concern you know because they do look kind of dorky they look kind of unusual I love these though but I said you know as cool as these are I I kind of want to switch this up dance a little more inconspicuous a little more of low-key a little more a little more chill a little less extra if you will and that then brings us to the custom ear plugs now I had heard about these for quite some time and then max got him and I saw how they looked I was like those are awesome dude and because max was a musician you know you just playing like death metal bands and these are the actual musician ear plugs so you have to go to an audiologist to get these because it requires a custom mold of your ear be made and it's very simple at you know it's a 15-minute process it's not nothing complicated you just just literally just google audiologist with like your zip code or your local you know postal code or whatever and it's going to you know come up audiologist call him up say I want to get some custom your plugs may and I'm in loud environments a lot I go to the club don't know exactly what you're talking about and you go in there again 15-minute procedure they just inject your they put a little bug in your ear and then they inject your ear with this silicon mold and let it harden for like 10 minutes they fish it out send it in to the company and you get to choose what color you want and so forth and then you get these back about a week later and here they are and basically what this is this is a mold of my ear canal this is my left ear canal and you want to get this Bend so it needs to go around the first bed in order to get the full attenuation across the spectrum and you can swap out these little plugs for different levels of hearing protection these are the nine decibel ones and for me those are sufficient that I don't get the hearing damage at the end of and I don't get that ringing at the end of the night but they're not so extreme that I can't understand what other people are saying I'll swap it out for a higher level if you say if I'm go into like a rock concert or something like that but for the most part I'd say the nine decibel one is going to be more than sufficient - you're not gonna get that hearing damage at the end of the night so these as you can see and I got the rose-colored the translucent rose and as I said you can get these custom you can get them like Sparkle swirl and you know all kinds of crazy colors black if you want to be you know goth but they just go in like this you just put them I in boom and boom there they are and they sit like this let me put this one in too so you can get an idea of what they look like and these are group these are fucking great these are the best in my experience you can hear better in fact you can hear other people's voices better because if they really are super effective they'll cancel out the damaging frequencies but that you can hear everything else much more clearly including other people's voices as you can see they do stick out a little bit but they're essentially unnoticeable and again they're quite convenient to just I just carry my pocket pop mouth boom soon as I get into the club and total protection I can feel comfortable that I'm not damaging my hearing it's funny when I went in to actually have the moulds made before they actually do it she conducted the audiologists she conducted a little test where you sit in a booth they put the you might have had this when you were in elementary school where they do like hearing tests or you know vision test hearing tests so they would put these headphones over your ears and you're in the soundproof room and then they set off a variety of like high-pitched and and different low-pitched tones and you know right and left and every time you hear it you raise your finger so they can tell like what is what are your limits of hearing and when the results came back for me I actually had what's called a notch in my hearing and it's a certain frequency where there's been damage done and she's like it's not bad but you made the right decision to come in to protect yourself from further damage and it's kind of crazy I do in fact have something it's called sudden tinnitus where the sudden onset tonights where like I'll just be sitting here and all of a sudden like that like I'll get this ringing in like my left ear and then it'll like slowly trail away it's harmless apparently but again it's a testament to the fact that going on after all these years can have lasting effects on your hearing so I it's one this this is one of those things that when I got it I was like why didn't you get this like ten years ago like what were you thinking you know you ever have something like that where you get it you're like I should have got this five ten years ago I'm like I'm gonna save myself so many problems so if you're on the fence about these and you've got the money for these now by the way these will run you about two hundred and twenty-five dollars at least initially for the tests and the molds to be made and then the actual the actual ear plugs themself and these are from West stone and these are kind of the top of the line now this is the older model the older iteration of this but there is a new version of this and let me show you the new version because they've really taken to the next level like these ones are about a couple years old and then here the brand-new ones so I'll just I'll show you the difference here so here's the old ones and then here's the new ones and you can see the it has a much more low profile it's much less it's just about half literally about half the size see if you see this here so it's about half the size and you see on the on the top here the plug does not actually protrude it's actually flush with the surface of it so you see here it's like this one sticks out this one's flush it's inside and in here I've got the nine decibel ones and they've got a little kind of little alien antenna for you to actually be able to fish it out because once you get these in there it can be kind of um and without this would be almost impossible to get out now let me show you the difference actually and you'll see these are essentially for all intents and purposes these aren't these are completely invisible you know so let me just throw these guys in here real quick you can see what they look like these are the same exact price so these are gonna be around 225 and again these are the profiles super-low we're comfortable enough to wear all night without any discomfort the protection supreme I can and again like I said it's it's almost like having enhanced hearing in the club I can hear better in the club the one thing I would say about these they have their they do make your voice seem louder in your own head when you have them in so there might be a period of adjustment like if you're talking to people the first couple of interactions you might notice them going like what what cuz you think you're talking a bit louder than you are so you just have to make that adjustment and like purposefully it'll make a conscious decision to talk a little louder and but after that it's fine I mean that's literally the only complaint I can have about these like they have a tendency to exaggerate the volume of your voice in your own head but aside from that these are fucking awesome like these are worth this is one of those purchases again that I feel is literally worth every penny literally worth every penny and more because you cannot put a price on your health am i right so again look at just check out the profile here you really can't you can't see him at all to get that pink translucent rose color and it's funny I was like should I get the clear and the audiologist she said well that's what most people think but you want to get like the Rose translucent because the the clear can kind of start to get a little yellow after a while it's kind of gross I've never had a problem with that with these you know because you I clean them with some regularity and then they've got your they've got my initials on it J al and R so you know which ones the left which one's the right but again these are a custom mold it's my ear canal and can hear better hearing protection absolutely amazing like I said this is probably easily the best thing I bought all like the like the most valuable thing like worthwhile thing that I purchased pretty much all your aside for my hot tub actually but I got that this year so there's yeah for as far as this year would be the hot tub amazing when we probably do another video about the hot tub because it's so phenomenally fantastic but but yeah you know I think people overlooks little things like that especially if you're younger you think it can't happen to you and you know sound is such an important thing for communication your speech your hearing how you're interpret sound how you're actually producing sound and you know as you probably know I've got this program resonator which is based on vocal projection and that was another thing that I that again it was kind of a health issue that which is why I created that program because I was losing my voice all the time if you listen to oh when he loses his voice all the time so I decided to go and get professional coaching in order to learn how to project my voice not only in a powerful way cuz I learned how to project my voice in a powerful way because it's attractive right I was sick of going up to girls and like having them say what what in these loud clubs and being feeling hamstrung feeling unable to communicate have it be getting ignored by girls in the club because I wasn't being able to project my voice loud enough and then furthermore at you know being out at these events on a weekly basis where we're talking these marathon sessions I'd lose my voice and the number one of the number one things I see on students and when they arrive on a bootcamp especially if they're new is they're very soft-spoken and it's just cut it's just cutting them off at the knees you know the before they can it's like they're ten feet behind the starting line before we even go out into the venue and no matter like how much I they understand the concepts and I can drill the techniques into their head if you can't project it's absolutely pointless like oh no technique in the world is gonna save you if the girl can't hear you so that's why I created resonator to teach people how to have strong attractive healthy vocal projection and be able to do it in a in a way that's not going to grind down your voice your layer so over the course of a night so you know it's kind of interesting as I've become the the elder of the tribe if you will uncle Jeffy here in this in this whole pickup game I've started to gain an awareness of the sort of ancillary health issues and you know I feel it's my duty to bring this information to you so you can avoid a similar terrible fate of getting ignored in the club like a bitch boy or getting you know your hearing damage so if these concepts interest you I'd encourage you to check out resonator at rst resonator comm and I hope this video has cleared up the mysteries of hearing protection like I said I've tried every solution every offering on the market essentially and I just kind of laid them out for you so it's up to you if you want to go them low on the lower end of the spectrum like I said the earpiece great budget choice but if you've got the if you've got the coin and I would highly encourage you it's gonna be you're not gonna regret it if you get those custom ear plugs change your life and actually improve your game and your results which is what we're all here for right anyway this has been Jeff II hope you enjoy this and we'll see you next time okay so let's do a quickie little breakdown on what happened there and now it is time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the SATs at SATs at 80% of the time this is the problem [Applause] hey buddies motherfucker ain't good evening he doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him so why the fuck I the fuck should she this is the roof of the mouth right here okay right yes [Music] smelling something nice touching the shoulders ah that's the touchdown right there not just being loud but being clear so that right sometimes people will say what what they heard you they heard the noise good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps with cheese and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding [Music] that looks so that was a nice clenching in here or - yes and that's what we don't want okay that's we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow they're swollen this is probably what my bosses look like literally cringing sit down shut up bug blah the other but you're dumb you're dumb you're dumb dumb dumb you're dumb your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a to MIT where we're telling stories do you want to be more excited or do you need to be more like calm and collected and that'll change often dynamically during the interaction itself it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice you're gonna be able to go out and purchase ice take your finger like this and push it push it and then it's a weirdest thing when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I truly believe this it's only a matter of time until they like  [Music] gave me a huge awareness of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicalities behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling and humor put on a pretty little fog day like hello I write that you know it's a little act and that's mostly quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game concept I was like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself Jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve for so so so long [Music]  you,aOlUkQFnNUA

yo yo what up this is your proverbial boy Jeffy and I'm here today at my dead father's creepy abandoned home in suburban Illinois staying in this place by myself I may as well be in a haunted house for all intents and purposes you know the places like ransacked empty I'm just here handling some final affairs and it's a weird feeling being here I got to say that you know I hadn't spoken my father in 25 years and just being in here and seeing that this is where he lived you know this is where he resided and just imagining you know what his final his final years must have been like you know and talking my cousin who actually lived here with him she's like by the end you know he died he'd died really early he he was 67 years old and she was basically like well by the end he was essentially a shell of his old self and he basically had lost the plot you know it kind of seemed like he'd given up like you've retired a couple years back and after that you know he would never hang out he would never take his cars out you know he used to be a big car guy and he had Corvettes when you drive him around and stuff he stopped doing all that he was basically living in filth and squalor and one has to wonder what made him kind of lose lose the plot like that you know and again his death it was an accident essentially I mean I don't want to get into the details too much but it was a routine surgical procedure that went went awry but you know by all accounts even prior to that he had kind of just given up and we kind of given up on life and being here  not to get too maudlin about it but I almost have to wonder had I'd been in his life like had I reconciled with him perhaps he would still be alive today and again I I always held a deep antipathy to my father for what he put us through I was younger how he gave up on the family like that if you read my book you know he went to prison after committing some horrible crimes and honestly I wasn't there I don't know what the fuck happened okay I don't know how guilty he really was of those things that they said he did which were horrific you know maybe the truth is somewhere in between but it clearly did something because when the cops came in and kicked in the door that night he went like this we're often at the dinner table you know the most awkward fucking family dinner ever and he just kinda went like this he put his hands behind his head and if you're not guilty of something you don't fucking do that you're like oh my god what is going on here right so you know again we'll never know the true story but that the thing is he never apologized you know I spoke to him briefly a couple times after he got out of prison and and he never once said look I'm sorry for what I put you guys through you know he was like just know I did nothing wrong I can't believe what that state of California did to me I'm never coming back there bla bla bla bla same old asshole and you know maybe if he had just said look I'm sorry about all this maybe I could have had in my heart to like be in his life and honestly I was kind of in the past couple years I was kind of starting to think about that you know maybe I should just hit him up you know not even to go fishing with him all the time but you know whatever I mean because literally I felt I don't wanna say sorry for him but I wasn't angry out of anymore if anything I felt you know how bad he must feel he's the one who would people ask how are your kids they're like oh you know they don't I don't talk to them or make some bullshit up and apparently when he was out here living with my extended family you know I wondered why didn't the extended family contact me and I guess the reason was he straight-up lied to him he said oh I you know I got in trouble out there I'd beat a guy up or something he made up some bullshit story they even read my book and I'm like what's all this about you doing all this crazy shit he's like oh you know that's embellishment Jeff put that in there too you know it's a metaphor hey you literally have the balls today was a fucking metaphor and I put it in there to like spice up to the book okay no motherfucker it was not to spice up the book but again I think what that illustrates is just how he had created in his mind this alternate you know story of what happened this alternate version of the events that allowed him to continue without having massive cognitive dissonance and you know everyone has blind spots I have blind spots my friends have blind spots and when I see stuff like that it just it makes me really wonder where my shit is you know and when you see that kind of stuff and honestly if we're being completely honest here and I've said this before but you know I think that the reason that you I'm I don't want to see you so cavalier about my relationships but but so kind of detached in a way from my relations it's difficult for me to get deep into relation but what I am I have a willingness to walk a zero fear of loss of course once the loss actually happens as it did last year you know how to breakup is very painful but I condition myself to that cuz I never want to be in a position where I'm so emotionally distraught that I make a mistake that ruined mine and other people's lives you know because I was so wrapped up and emotional about some relationship that I built him in my head but again this stuff does neither here nor there what I'm trying to get out with this video I guess and I'm just kind of taking out loud here it's just what you know might his life have been different maybe he would be alive today and I'm not saying I'm not saying if I was in his life does leave it look even if I didn't forgive them I still wouldn't be coming out here hanging out with them you'd probably be just like chit-chatting with them on Facebook once on while or you know saying happy birthday or something like that so I mean it's not going to change what happened and honestly I I kind of had in my heart for giving him like I said it was a little official with him but I forgive him but maybe if he'd known that but here's the thing really attends a day whether whether I forgave him or not it doesn't fucking matter at the end of the day what matters if he forgave himself now the fact that he never accepted responsibility for anything I think that was crucial in all this I think he kind of festered and it grew and it was a dark place inside I'm done eventually consumed him and he gave up you know he felt I again I'm speculating here but I suspect at the end there he probably felt his whole life had been allied than bullshit he fucked it up you know and look we've all made mistakes in life I've made many mistakes in life and again you know you could say oh I was a troubled youth well guess what I'm not a fucking youth anymore I'm a 41 year old man you know you could say Oh Hitler had a trouble time like dude doesn't fucking matter at a certain point you gotta suck it up buttercup and be like I'm taking responsibility for this shit and I'm going to hold myself to a certain standard of behavior and have I made many mistakes and regrets do I have regrets yeah in ways that I've treated people that I've interacted with in ways that I've you know conducted myself in relationships but the thing is this I  I've always tried to in some small way make it right or not even make it right but like let those people know look I'm aware what I was fucked I just want to tell you I I do regret having done it if you don't care at all about that that's fine too I just wanted to let you know and I want to let you know that going forward I'm holding myself to a personal standard I'll never do that to anyone else and it's again if they forgive you or not it's it's not my problem it's fucked up as it sounds the point being though you got to you got to find a way to forgive yourself and you only way that forgiveness that self-forgiveness can come is if you know that you're making a concerted you know dedicated effort to hold yourself to to accountable to a certain standard of behavior and conduct that you feel is it aligned with your core values because without having core values you are just a rudderless fucking mess and again you know this is classic Tony Robbins shit when I have like my Saturn Return you know how when I you know I was like thirty and I moved to Spain and I first stopped drinking and I and I got myself into a more healthy headspace for the first time of course I'm back slidden several times you know it was we all know emotional Fitness is not a it's like physical fitness an ongoing thing requires maintenance you're going to backslide you're gonna have little periods but still once I made that decision I knew that going forward I had defied a clearly defined sense of the person I wanted to be and that forms the bedrock of your self-respect you know of your self-esteem because you know that every day you're maybe you're not perfect but you're striving to uphold a personal standard that that defines you and again without that you're just kind of aimless and I suspect that may have been would have with my dad and being in here it's it's sad it's sad to know that I'll never have that opportunity to you know see him again or say what's up again and but that's not what makes me sad what makes me sad is just thinking how he you know even after all the shit you know he was just like fucking dad dude and you know I got a lot of my sense of humor for him a lot of shit I don't know I mean there were there were good times back then you know he was always kind of a jerk and everything but still no relationship like that is all bad and just thinking of him in here with it you know living in a squalor at the end  it sucks and I I wouldn't I wouldn't want that for any of you and I don't want that for me that's I guess that's what this little trip out here is has done you know it's closure I'm taking care a lot of his affairs and stuff but really it's just realizing that I don't I don't ever want want to end up like that man and so I'm gonna strive every day to live the kind of life that doesn't lead me there and you know the reason I'm making this video is because I know a lot of people watch my ship for whatever reason and to implore you to do the same a lot of people that watch my shit op general are very young and this seems like abstract stuff that just happened to going to happen in the future but it happens every fucking day every fucking day that you go out and engage with the world you're laying your laying the bricks of your life anyway have to be too much of a fucking downer but you know it's a little bit different kind of video you know it's probably the only opportunity that I'll ever have to make a video of this nature of this particular specific nature but yeah it is what it is so I'll be back next week with a more uplifting video I although I guess in a sense this is a pretty uplifting video too if you think about it but you know to get a little craft now if you like this please like and subscribe and I'll see you next time on my fucking chest,abvyoMhxtSA

really quick results I recommend it to everybody if you want to get good at online game get the XQ the program in 2014 I gave you access to a limitless ocean of hot girls you don't see it the girls who just want to have fun and we're just as horny as you are if not more  and execute the program I showed you how to play the online game to win with a repeatable formula took over ten years to developing and incorporate the four key elements moment where he massive volume with a replicable copy/paste system a wide variety of techniques that completely automate the entire process and a tiered system of screening unless your zero in on the girls who want to get laid that night execute the programs the first online game system cut through the bullshit of online dating and consider yourself very lucky that you found this page because by the end of this video I'm gonna make sure that you become one of the fun and cool guys she's already predisposed to fuck with the cutting-edge technology of execute the program version 2.0 so now I'm gonna tell you how to get laid tonight without having to leave your house with six devious new techniques including my insane fresh online opener that frankly blows my old material out of the fucking water when I made the original program I research it for three full years going on hundreds of dates and sleeping with well over a hundred women from online game I exhaustively chronicled all this and assemble it into one coherent package and then waited for reports to come in from guys who are using the system that's when something amazing began to happen guys were taking the ball and running with it improvising and fleshing out the ideas and tactics even more originally there was zero plans for an e tp2 but as the months wore on it soon became apparent that there was enough brand new material to actually warrant a new module that would not only further clarify the original program but also build upon it in a way that truly provided massive value so here we are execute the program 2.0 represents a far more evolved and new understanding of online game brought about not only by my extensive experience but from helping most guys common problems and some very advanced ones as well each ep2 is the online / app dating guide that gets you laid period it's as easy as photoshopping your pics real quick uploading them and coming up with a cool profile that takes an hour or two then you start matching you could be well on your way to banging 5 or 6 hours after you watch ETP - again it's a repeatable and effective formula that literally any old schmuck can copy paste and go meet up with a girl who's DTF so easy just fuck now no bullshit and the program automates the entire process so without further ado here are the six techniques that will instantly increase your chances to score a date tonight number one the one phrase you should never use in your messages to women on the mastermind group people are always submitting screenshots of their interactions for review time and time again the same issues would pop up and the group would gently reprimand the fellow and get them on the right path I saw a lot of guys including the phrase let me know in their messages I want to be very clear on this there is no context wherein let me know doesn't come off as super needy and lame cut this shit out of your lexicon immediately number two my best new opener when I originally released execute the program I revealed my number one opener that got me a 90 percent response rate oh hi there I feel you appear attractive and consequently would like to explore the possibility of enhancing your life by means of exposure to my awesomeness kay thanks bye and I was super sad to see it go because I knew once it was in the public domain it would be burned but necessity is the mother of invention and so I was forced to come up with a new opener and frankly this one blows the old one out of the water here it is so I looked at your thing you seem pretty good now let me explain why this works so well there's a lot of levels going on here first it's complimentary yet still extremely me there's like zero effort being put forth it's a shrug and a week the word thing is vague so it makes the girl become curious so she starts investing to find out what you mean her thing could also be interpreted as a vulgar double entendre about 25 percent will respond with a comment about me looking at her pussy so your brain up sex right away but in a way that absolves you of the stigma of the sex creep archetype this is like a -1 on the investment racial scale and in case you're wondering the investment racial scale is one of the brand new concepts in ETP 2 that'll guarantee you never overplay your hand and keeps her interested and hooked on the line all the way through to the date number 3 how to build a proper message funnel my funnel is very basic number 1 I use a minimal investment opener like the one above - I drop a ridiculously over-the-top compliment such as you're like a baby polar bear sliding on a rainbow into a pot of gold 3 I give her a statement of intent then immediately sweep it under the rug with introducing myself for example well I feel the chemistry in the air is palpable followed by hi I'm Jeff they almost always follow up with her name without addressing the statement of intent but tacitly accepting it this is the equivalent of weaving statements of intent into the fabric of the conversation almost subliminally in real life game 4 I finally drop a bigger statement of intent acknowledging the possibility of a meet-up now there's just the basic skeleton of the funnel and in the program 2.0 I go into exquisite detail on every small nuance of building your funnel out so you always know exactly how to respond in any given situation this goes so far above and beyond the basics that I provided in the original program it's insane number 4 how to get her chasing you on the actual date so at the end of the night she pulled you and feels like she's won it's generally in your interest for the girl to feel like she's being awkward on the date don't directly call her out or anything just allow yourself communication to imply to you're just a little bit cooler than her and wouldn't mind if she just left I don't go too far with this just enough to get her to the point where she'll basically follow your lead without question and understand while I am communicating man to woman intent at the same time I'm giving off and I'm not sold kind of vibe done right you won't get a lot of resistance token or otherwise the girl thinks she's because you have them chasing your validation without giving in for a while and you're building a lot of sexual tension combine this with the new strategies in ETP - for ultra smooth pulling at the end of the day and you're gonna be unstoppable then again why even pull it all when you can have her come right to your place number 5 the straight to your house date this was one of those why the hell didn't I think of this moment I had my program down pat and was getting great success so it never occurred to me to just skip the date entirely and get her straight to your house I mean it makes sense right fuck having to spend money and be outside in a loud bar this shit's like GrubHub of her vagina we started building up strategies for this on the ETP facebook mastermind group and at first we were using an old pickup tactic one guy from the group would usually take the girls to the pier about ten minutes from where he lived and since it was summertime and the beach was busy he'd say come you to my place so we can take an uber to the beach to avoid the parking issues when they got there he'd have him come straight into his home now no matter what when they called it a night they'd have to go back to his place since they were there earlier the girl would feel a lot more comfortable coming back inside when they got back at the end of the night after that however we just took it to the next level in ETP - you'll learn how to determine which girls are prime candidates for this sort of date you'll learn how to present it to her in a way that's non needy and outcome independent as well as a whole program of what to do on the date when she's at your pad as well number six my infallible test to make sure your messages don't sound lame a lot of guys are scratching their heads when messaging because you send her something that you think is cool but it can be interpreted as needy rapport seeing or value taking so here's a quick Lippman test for this read it out loud first the way you intend it to sound then again in a rapport seeking chode voice evaluate so let's read this sentence first with normal tonality hey want to meet up later let me know and now with showed voice want to meet up later let me know this is extremely effective at weeding out show tonality and can be quite amusing as well you'll learn multiple techniques like this one to ensure your tonality is always crystal clear and OnPoint now if you apply these six tweaks today your chances will have just increased by 10 billion percent I personally guarantee these changes can make all the difference and you're getting laid from a girl you met online or getting dick it's a simple process once you know what to do you'll be the guy that gets away with saying anything because you have the sacred knowledge that as long as the overall vision of yourself that you're presenting is on point everything will

[Music]  alright alright alright alright so welcome back I'm Jeff II like your creepy sex addicted uncle who you don't bring your girlfriend's around because he fucks them so what I'm basically gonna do is I'm just gonna get going here with a to straight QA I'm straight up so anyone got a question you go ahead how do I deal with super loud clubs basically the same way I deal with these idiots attempting to talk over me I just ignore it and talk louder yeah I mean if you're honest I hear this quite a bit I mean look if you're on accustomed to going to clubs in general and you're you're starting out in in these clubs here it can be quite a jarring experience I mean if you look at it I mean frankly sometimes I'm in these clubs and I think there probably isn't a more inhospitable environment for humans to exist in aside from like some kind of war zone right because you've got like this like ear blistering fucking music you've got lights flashing your face might have a fucking seizure like you're watching Pokemon or something and you know it can be difficult to deal with a lot of guys they say this to me on program but like I just can't be hurt it's like dude frankly like yeah exactly right so I've I've dealt with it you know I've come up with a couple of ways to deal with this first off is you actually are going to want to work on improving your vocal tone your vocal quality okay now have you ever been involved in singing or anything of that nature okay yeah so how did I learn how to project my voice well I was the San Francisco karaoke champion of 2005 that always sounds cooler in my mind before I say it out loud yet I keep saying it so but yeah I mean just anything where you might actually want to go as far as to take vocal lessons I know that Tyler did that because it's an apparatus you have to learn how to to operate it there's several pieces that have to work in conjunction in order for you to actually project your voice in a clear way as opposed to just screaming you could just scream you just going to the club and fucking scream but the thing with that you're going to fuck your voice up now at the end of the night you ever feel like your voice feels kind of fucked up yeah that's because you're using it improperly so it really starts down here in the diaphragm right make sure that you you're actually projecting with a full sort of like bellows of air right and then really project it you want to bring what another thing I could help is kind of to think of your voice box think about bringing it down into the chest more as opposed to speaking through the head right and then of course just just like speaking through you ever heard like they talked about punching they talked about punch through right so you almost want to speak through the girl of course if you're in a super loud environment another thing that you can do I mean shit you're going to want to get as as close to them as possible in many ways you could say it's an excuse to get close to them of course that's a terrible mindset okay do you understand why that's a terrible mindset I need an excuse to get close I don't I don't just get close because I'm a fucking man and your woman and that that's what this interaction is right like I need some excuse to get close Oh perfect it's a while but I can get closer alright so no but again so you're going to want to close proximity talk directly in the ear and another thing you might when I really consider is if every single club you go to even like the major like what's the loudest club you can think of in the city Hakkasan there's one janky little area that you can go that's somewhat less loud there okay it's kind of a high-traffic area I forget I don't even how to describe it but like you can just kind of stand there hand of God and it's a little less loud it's not quiet you're at the fucking library doing your math homework or something but by descent by the same token you know every club there is going to be that one little area that you can discover that's going to be a little bit less loud so it's good to either you can either post up there or if you're interacting with the girl you can like you get past like if you can you pass social hook point then you just be like oh here come here come here I want to tell you something it's quieter here it's quieter here you can just lead her over there another major major major consideration is this you know if you're going to these clubs day in the doubt I mean I've been doing this job for 11 years I've had this job now for my first bootcamp was in January 2003 I do about 45 of these a month or a month a year you know so you you do that you do the math it seems like 45 a month but no you do the math so you know when you're in these environments for a long long time scale on a macro timescale you will notice hearing damage you know you really will so it is dorky as it may seem to you at the time you may wish to invest in some sort of earplugs okay there's a couple different kinds you can get obviously I would not recommend the sleeping ones the foam ones that's bullshit because it just looks I mean you're not gonna be able to hear shit and you know and there's something to be said for that because I kind of don't give a fuck what they're saying anyway to annex a certain sense right you know what I mean but there's a couple different kinds you can get that are actually a little bit better than that and the one if you want to go the cheap route you can get there twelve bucks and get on Amazon they're called a domotic research ET y mot IC and they're again twelve bucks and they're just little plugs they go in the air and what they'll do is they'll kind of the let anyway the sound in except where the harmful frequencies are tuned out but you can still hear what's being said now those aren't the best ones because even with those and I was talking about with Todd about this earlier with those it can give your voice a muffled quality in your own head so you won't really be able to tell how loud you're speaking and it can kind of make you feel sort of removed from the environment to an extent it's kind of fucked up but you will grow accustomed to it if you wear them long enough the better ones to get or actually the musicians earplugs and those are wearing those in the club it's a lot like it's almost just like the volumes turned down a little bit right just to the point where it's not harmful but you can still hear very clearly now the downside of that is those require a custom fitting on your ear and they're also like to three hundred bucks so you know you get the $12 or you get the three hundred dollar ones so again when you're dealing with loud clubs those are all some things take into consideration all right but again if it's continued you will generally if you're going out a lot you will generally adapt to that okay there's very few clubs that I go to what I think Jesus Christ I literally cannot you can even scream directly in someone's ear and they just can't hear they can't hear you story in Miami certain plate I probably Hakkasan here like on the dance floor and stuff like that so but but as a rule of thumb the more that you go out in these environments you'll just acclimate to it and you'll naturally it's like you know step into the role so to speak you'll just you'll start to do it because if you don't do it what's going to happen  you get it fucking ignored because you're a nonentity you cannot even speak these are a fuckin nonentity unless you're running some kind of high-octane physical physically off the bat or something like that you know you're doing like hardcore quote-unquote beast mode okay alright anyone else know alright sick I guess we'll just sit in silence until Tata arrives okay you  manager fatigue on a weekly basis hmm well um well you know I again I have a lot of stuff that I typically need to do the next day this involves like getting high and watching television but I used to I did used to have a nine-to-five and it was rather that it is rather taxing to go in and show up to some fucking meeting where they're talking about the TPS reports and I've had two hours sleep as I've been up banging or attempting a bang fruitlessly as the case may be and you know probably hungover as fuck attempting to look you know attentive and you know short like with a clipboard looking intently at the clipboard things of that nature but the things for me back in the day like there was no there was really no other choice for me it was like oh yeah this fucking sucks Oh too fucking bad because what's the alternative what was the alternative continue to be a fucking chode in other words to continue to like live this life where I'm just living in reaction my sex life is basically just going from girl like whoever would deign to sleep with me and getting into some long-term relationship with them and tell the deteriorate to the point of acrimony and no longer worked out you know I just didn't that was unacceptable to me so when you hear about some mentality they talk about burning the boats that's really what it is I mean I'm sure we've all heard that that story that old fable you know I believe it was some ancient Greek battle where they sailed across to sack the city and then once they landed on the shore they set fire to the boats and now if they want to get back home you have to win there's no fucking alternative now a lot of guys hear that shit and they'll do things like you know make radical life decisions make radical changes in their life and they'll burn bridges but here's the thing and Tyler talks about this as well just because you burn the boats doesn't mean you're gonna fucking succeed okay you've just set up a situation where if you don't succeed you're fucked but that doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna succeed like I see a lot of guys do that well I'll burn the boats now it's all gonna happen for me and then like they you know tutors headed there fuck they're like fired from their job they're like living back with their mom or something it's like back in mother's basement you know so you also have to execute right now we get for me ice logged through that and I would show up for these fucking meetings but again what was the eventual outcome of that well I was fired okay I've been fired from every job I've ever had by the way including the the first one that I workout when I was a 14 which was that chucky cheese do you guys know what chucky cheese is yeah I was the the mount with a rat everyone thinks he's a mouse he's actually a rat that yeah it's really he's like this cigar-chomping sewer rat and they made me go in the Chucky suit because I was short still coming up and you know they don't want tall people in the suit because it frightens the children and so I remember one time I took LSD and went to work and I was in the Chucky costume I was like Chucky time half the time right and it looks like this happy Mouse right but underneath it's it's like grinning lunatic with fucking irises decides at dinner plates and I remember at the end of the shift a boss called me and he was like Jeff come to the office I need to talk to you I'm like fuck busted right he sits me down he's like I saw you out there on the floor today and I just want to say that was great that was fantastic work today you know you're so enthusiastic you were loving it you're dancing around yeah more of that more than I was like okay so yeah but but in this hotel job I worked at I mean I was just so fucked up that it got to the point where you know I'd show up late leave early take a two-hour lunch masturbate in the office while sniffing the glue that we use to make the employees nametags and I would carry around a butterfly knife through the office and threaten people with it and but it was okay because I had printed up a label that said letter opener on it so it's not I'm not threatening people with a deadly weapon I'm getting ready to open some important correspondence okay so yeah you know go get fucking fired that's my that's my recommendation now let's okay to get real though I'm I'm 38 what is it 30 its April right yes I'm 38 and 4/12 that's one third if you reduce the fraction and you know I go out three nights a week and I'm up banging probably till three or four on most of the other nights occasionally I get a good night's sleep which is nice from time to time I take a lot of naps I go to the gym quite a bit I go to the gym you know five six some of seven days a week and and that's the thing you know if you just gotta kind of immerse yourself I like to hang around youthful people as well I'm a Mersenne youth culture I hang around youthful people if you guys ever heard of a person called das it's either Felix Dennis or Dennis Felix he's like the number two entrepreneur in the UK under Richard Branson anyway he wrote a book called how to get rich and what he says in that book he says one of the things kind of struck a chord with me was that if you're like in your mid to late 30s and you want to start a new business you better have a young ass partner okay because the young partner is going to want to do he's going to be all like you know a little puppy dog let's do this let's try this let's try this and come and put all these ideas that you might be like that's fucking stupid that's not gonna work like I don't want to do that there's too much effort right so he'll push you you could mentor him and conversely he'll push you that's why I brought it Julien you know that's why toddler really took the time there's a massive time commitment for him to bring Julian up because if you think about it you know he brainwashed him for two years basically he was they were together you know Julian was like a fucking wreck still is in many ways but just psychologically not physically anymore yeah I mean he's a sociopath I mean I'm a bit of a borderline personality disorder we were all fucked up all pickup coaches are crazy some are crazy good some are crazy bad there's no such thing as both so which one am i but anyway um you know you got to bring on like that youthful energy I mean I was on the airplane today and there was this guy there's a couple of businessmen in front of me they were talking some bullshit like oh we're gonna go golfing and Herpa derpa daddy and these guys looked about 55 years old you know and there's fat look look really fucking worn down and and and everything and then and then in their conversation I couldn't help it over here because they're basically screaming on the fucking airplane and it goes like so when I turn 40 next year I'm gonna have a big party Herpa derpa dee dee I don't like Jesus Christ that's fucking 40 this guy's my age you know what I mean he looks like is about 55 years old I'm not saying I'm some great shakes I got like lines keep getting deeper every fucking day look at the mirror but by the same token I need that guy and most of my friends that are like my square civilian friends you know they look about the same they're wearing like these Dockers like up to here you know they're posted pictures of their kin on fail book that's all they basically do you know and and they just they just look old they act old they feel old you feel old being around them so again it a lot of it it's equal parts taking care of yourself physically you know even stupid things like remembering to drink a shit ton of water all the time like if you in the club a lot of times I see guys and they're like really their energy seems to be like really you know waning in the club and you just young guys in like here slam this pint of water boom and like okay I actually feel better you know so I think it's a combination of one straight-up willpower and again Tony Robbins often talks about emotional leverage and that's really what it was for me what is emotional leverage well basically it's like when the potential pain of making a change has now become outweighed by the very real pain of continuing to do things as you've been doing oh really you got to decide like what exactly one of this set specific goals and strive towards them understanding that it's a long-term endeavor much like working out you know whenever I get a guy on program who has taken martial arts and who is advanced to a you know a relatively high level of martial arts like blue belt purple belt these guys are very good students they tend to be very very good students because they've gone through that process of rolling around on the ground in their jujitsu class and getting their fucking ass handed to them for like the first three months right like I went to what to jujitsu with my roommate after he was pestered me for years to go and I'm like damn that should fucking suck he's like how long how long are you a complete ass clown like that he's like probably about three four months like he's like yeah well you know that's if you go every day I'm like fuck you know it's like really disheartening to me you know so but that's not a priority for me to learn how to do jiu-jitsu that's not a fucking priority for me okay especially considering how many injuries I see him you know accumulate over the years of course my injuries are internal and mental the scars will never fade right okay anyone else boom come on be creative yeah oh this Jesus tattoo this reflects my love of Christ I have a new heart a new start and the Lord Jesus Christ I hope that all you've all heard the good news he died for our sins and I happened to be in a liquor store earlier today and they had a $0.50 machine that was doling out these these temporary Jesus tattoos and so I said what better time than now to repent to repent so now I'm fucking Jesus and everything like that  education and physical fusion and fission fission and fusion inflation inflation inflation inflation inflation and flavor country check inflation inflation inflation inflation,bAR6aJP6RBo

hey what up is your proverbial boy Jeffy I'm here today in Chicago in front of this bean thing I'm gonna flick this bean later this is my attempt at a Chicago accent even though I'm not actually from Chicago I'm from California well I grew up in Chicago a bit but that's not my authentic voice okay I actually speak in this kind of California patois but that's the topic of today's video is authenticity and moreover vulnerability this is something that came up in a human a session at the free tour last night here in Chicago and I thought it was a really good back and forth and real good dialogue that we had so I'm gonna share that with and but before I do that I just want to talk a bit about vulnerability and what that means I mean vulnerability really isn't seen as a masculine trait in our society make yourself vulnerable if you're not feeling great you're feeling sad something like that but in actuality it's a very powerful trade it's a very masculine trait in many ways cuz it shows power and shows confidence and it shows being on your path it actually takes a lot more balls to go up and present your actual self to people than it is to actually put on a fake front because it means you're able to face up to reality not just to other people but to face that internally as well with yourself and come to terms with your own feelings and your own predilections in your own disposition with yourself it's actually one of the most powerful things that you can do you're not putting on this fake front with other people you're not trying to walk on eggshells hide behind the mask it's actually one of the strongest and brave this things you can do and get an award like Caitlyn Jenner for bravery or something kay so if you think about it even going out and opening just approaching a random girl in the club a random person is actually putting yourself in a vulnerable space because you're putting your balls on the chopping block so to speak you're putting your personality on the line so again vulnerability isn't necessarily a bad thing so let's crack into the free tour video and we can check it out right now  yeah upfront so it's actually true right what about vulnerability and emotional horrible if you're like a lot of us we judge ourselves for having these emotions we can't hide community to pick up fucking bad-ass but I also always find that actually  well okay so give me a specific example I kind of further example it's a breakup right you really love her and try to be like Deadpool where it's fine and then you're suppressing that suppressing that suppressing that no we play oh you just need a fucking Express honey well okay here's the thing about that I'm I like I said earlier and I some people might have thought this was like a joke I'm like a very sentimental person so I had a situation recently where a girl kind of broke it off with me right so and what do you think I did was I like on pickup badass Jeffie it's like no I went to the fucking karaoke bar I sang air supply until I started crying and then I sat at the bar fucking crying so I've never become cynical about this shit ever you know what I mean it's very very easy especially when you see this stuff that people do in the club like again the stuff we alluded to earlier where random freak out for no reason ignoring you for no reason it's very easy to get like sexist beliefs okay like look you get to skip the line skip the line free drinks offered free vacation get to act with impunity like an asshole people like will love them obsessive dick the proverbial dick you know it's like don't worry dude they'll turn 35 okay it's it's happening okay so you can't get sucked into that hole like that that will not serve you well you know like I've always said I'm not going to become like one of these cynics jaded and it's very it's very difficult you know especially if you're getting fucked over a lot you know and it's also another thing that's very difficult is to you know not decide to fuck others over as well and I've certainly done that but you know I think you just got to like let it happen and understand that this pickups it's a lifelong journey if you're gonna have like a month of this shit like where you're feeling doubts sometimes that's gonna happen sometimes you're gonna you're gonna just not be into it for a month sometimes you're gonna have a breakup sometimes you're gonna have an illness in the maybe your family member has until all kinds of shit can happen you've gotta understand it's a lifelong thing say true yourself because that authenticity is has a lot of power right authenticity has a lot of fuckin power what is the power in authenticity truth beauty I mean but it's true right like what the power authenticity is this you guys who Derek is one of the other instructors so this guy is like a very uncompromising fellow okay so the way he puts it is like this imagine that you are the CEO of a tampon concern the tampon company tampons United incorporated and you have to decide where are you gonna spend your marketing budget what demographic what's your demographic dudes know old lady's past menopausal age know young young girls prepubescent girls know so you any effort you're spending on marketing those people who's wasted so again what's this analogy coming back to you it's like look you are the tampon you hard  you are being the tampon we can attend so quit being like look back in the day I think and this is interesting too I see this in like my hot seat videos as well because I show some clips from like long ago like the mullet days and then I show some like you know more recent stuff and I'm getting success in both of the clips and then you know I show some where I'm getting my tools as well but really the but there is a subtle distinction that you can see if you if you're looking for it and the distinction is this in the older Clips it's a little bit more hey hey do you like me I'm Jeff Jeff Allen Jeff Allen here's my steez here's what I'm putting down do you like it do you like it let me kind of explain why you should like it or demonstrate why you should it's a lot more like kind of an an act right and I was trying to make everyone like me as opposed if you look at the stuff now it's more like yo what's up it's a lot more grounded it's just like this is it if you're not interested in this I will find someone who is look if I have to talk to ten girls in the club to find the one that thinks I'm like God I can do that it's no skin off my back now here's the ironic thing or rather the paradoxical thing the less of a fuck you give about trying to impress them paradoxically the more you will find that you have chemistry with people why well I'm not sure exactly why but I think it's because when you look there's something deeply off-putting about neediness about wanting to impress fellow about needing it to work or trying to get value from them when you don't understand your own value proposition there's something about that that people just in general feel very like not net away right whereas the person who's just like very very comfortable results get of whether that's being vulnerable whether that's having a great time whether that's being sexual at cetera they're like wow this person is free perhaps in some ways that I'm not and if I were to hang out with this person maybe I could feel like this too you know because what's the number one rule of game what in my mind whatever you feel they feel so it's really all about putting dialing what you can internally and not worrying about like whether or not it's well received out here now look that doesn't mean that you don't know how to approach in a way that's not creepy it's like run up from behind some girls go hey like hey that's just me that's just how I approach it's my shit you know I mean there's certain like broad rules that you know outer game rules and stuff but the 20% that gets 80% of the results is that internal self-amusement if you will right in the self and the enjoyment of the process itself and bringing that to people drawing them in as opposed to trying to manipulate someone else into like you which is again shit man back in the day it was all about trying to manipulate into liking you so I'd say like embrace it but you also have to know outer game principles you have to so but that's easy to learn I think that nuts and bolts shit that's not super difficult to learn I can I can fix that shit over the course of a weekend you ever heard of the uncanny valley right so it's idea that so if you have like a humanoid doll right the more it the more it looks identical to an actual person the more familiarity you have with it right so let's say you have an industrial robot that makes cars there's it looks almost nothing like a person but has very low familiarity then you have like you know like a stuffed doll okay a little bit more a little bit more familiarity then you've got like say a mannequin okay more familiarity then let's say you have a dead body it looks very close to a person but it's it's so close but it's not all the way there or let's say a zombie right or let's say what was that fucking movie that would Tom hate like the Polar Express I don't know if your member that's yet it's like one of the early like Pixar's and where it looked it was kind of like rotoscope or something where it looked it's um vaguely fucking creepy about it it's like like so the familiar area will rise until it gets almost there at which point it drops dramatically and that's the valley where it's like an uncanny resemblance and then once you get to an actual person then it goes right back up right so what's the uncommon uncanny valley and pick up  well the uncanny valley pick up is this so let's say you have a guy who doesn't like have it dialed internally he doesn't believe his value proposition to the girl but he knows a bunch of lions and shit so he'll go up and he'll be like hey dude he's like saying the things that a guy who's successful would say but the guy who's attracted to her would say but there's something again he doesn't understand that principle behind it he just knows the tactic so he's putting it on either too much or too little and it just see there's something off about it there's like dude I don't know what the fuck this is but it's fucking weird like and again you'll say I see it like I see it a lot when you know students go up and they're like really gamy you'll see the girl just like I don't know what have you ever had this happen like what what is what is your experience with that like what does it feel like when they do it to you  euh if you feel yourself cool like butter but like exists with this peaceful theme like like it just disgusting taste on your tongue and you just can't put your finger out but you just know there's something awry you know so look now here's the thing too when you're learning stuff you're probably going to come off like that at some point it's almost inescapable but you can but you have to like accept that I mean shit dude honestly me being up here saying this like I can assure you I've been the uncanny zombie pickup creep like more than almost probably anyone in here ever will be you know but I had to do that to another nor to kind of like learn it now a lot of people just aren't comfortable with that because they they're willing to put themselves up you know up to ridicule or scrutiny in that way so yeah I think that authenticity is very important and if that if that involves becoming vulnerable so be it yeah glasses we talked about a baseline for down well how do you know agree that baseline problem I think I have is in a very energetic no but for some reason there's a penis straw in it  so I found things about do energetic being too high up they're not grounded enough so I'm wondering how to use this good around the base they don't come back to Italy to develop better um I think a lot will hold are you a lot of it just comes on getting older I think you have to kind of mature into it like because right now I mean I don't know your background I don't know your story I don't know where what you're doing where you're coming from but I find in general it's never wise to indulge in generalizations but in general I think that younger guys know you're still trying to kind of figure out what you're about what's your place in the world what's your path so to speak and you know at age 42 I wake up in the morning and I'm like well I guess this is how it turned out you know what I mean like this is it this is who I am and that's how I look and what I do and you know what the media says about me and and and everything you know so it's like it's like either you like it or you don't do you know what I mean whereas for you I mean there's still like a couple ways you could take it you know you can take it this way you can take it that way so and then furthermore - you get like a lot more what's the word I'm looking for you get a lot more not just the groundedness well there's yeah that's that's definitely what we're talking about here but there's also like just more experience not with pickup per se but it's like world experience so you become better able to control conversations and stuff like that they're like oh I went to Sardinia I'm like oh Sardinia yeah you know I went through a 2008 did you ever go to the billionaire's Club yeah was crazy was 35 dogs for a fucking red ball on the ferry there my friend got sick like like I'll just have some fucking story about it you know what I mean like Africa oh yeah I remember I went to South Africa in like 2010 it was crazy I was there on Thanksgiving and we had Springbok for fucking Thanksgiving dinner it was fucking nuts yeah we would cage diving I actually vomited on a great white shark off the coast of the Cape of Good Hope like on on it like on a fuck how many people could say that vomited on a wild great white shark it was crazy didn't seem to mind it just kind of fucking went and then other fish came and ate it so ultimately if you're gonna have success at this stuff you've got to be vulnerable you got to be in a place where you're willing to put your actual personality on the line and think about it what's the goal of a lot of this stuff ultimately is to get into a long-term relationship with somebody and if you're not putting yourself in a completely vulnerable position with that person in a long-term relationship it's gonna be like a nightmare essentially like think about it what am I talking about here you know if you're in a relationship with somebody and you're afraid to be like shit hair in the morning like rolling out of bed like looking like garbage like with your with your gut hanging out you're like balls hanging like down to your knees hopefully your balls don't hang down to your knees but you know what I mean like looking like shit in the morning or just being your authentic self in your most unguarded moments you're always gonna be walking on eggshells in that relationship around that person and it's essentially this kind of like a living hell so the ideal is to become at ease with yourself in those most unguarded moments let go of the paranoia let go of the micromanaging let go of this trying to like walk the tightrope of what you think other people will like and I think what you're gonna find is this like I said in the video you know in the in the excerpt paradoxically you're gonna find that the more you are your authentic self the more you end and stop caring about what other people think the more that you actually connect with other people because that attraction that you would get from the routines or putting on a mask or putting on the little vaudeville act well the attraction you're gonna get from being authentic that's ten times more powerful than that previous stuff that you were doing and that's something that I found as I've grown older and come into my own more and more and become more grounded at ease of my own self and I think you'll find that as well it has been Jeff props Akaka licking the bean I'll see you next time one thing that guys tell me students they'll say but by the end of the night I am just depleted I feel exhausted I feel physically mentally emotionally depleted there's a variety of reasons for that one of those is you know what we call persona fatigue because they're trying to put on a person a little vodka like hey you know my right thought you know some little act and that that's obviously quite draining [Music],cAAM0cVv_aM
what up you're repugnant degenerates in his eye proverbial boy Jeffy and today I want to talk about the rules some love them some hate them some don't even know what they are but ignorance is no excuse in the eyes of the law now of course what I'm talking about here are the general rules of thumb that apply not just a pickup but to any skill or any sort of discipline that might be out there and the reason I was thinking about this today I was reading a book on the toilet and as I am wanted to do one of the many places I do some light reading and one of reason is this this book Stephen King on writing a memoir of the craft as you may know I dabble in writing a little bit wrote a book here and there and it's something that's always fascinated me and as we all know you know Stephen King is one of the great most prolific writers of our time and in this memoir one thing kind of created an idea for this video here and I was reading he's talking about grammar and it basically the idea he's talking about should you always adhere to the strictest rules of grammar as outlined in Strunk & white rules of grammar the famous book that is essentially the Bible of grammar and let me read you a quote from the book here he says must you write complete sentences each time every time perish and thought if your work consists only of fragments and floating clauses the grammar police aren't going to come and take you away even William Strunk that Mussolini of rhetoric recognized the delicious pliability of language it is an old observation he writes that the best writers sometimes disregard the rules of rhetoric yet he goes on to add this thought which I urge you to consider unless he is certain of doing well the writer will probably do best to follow the rules however and the telling clause here is unless he is certain of doing well if you don't have a rudimentary grasp of how the parts of speech translate into coherent sentences how can you be certain that you are doing well how will you know if you're doing ill for that matter the answer is of course that you can't you won't so the idea here is the rules exist so you know when to break them right for the vast vast vast majority of especially guys who are just starting out in game you would do very well to adhere to the groundwork that's been laid out before you by people who have been studying this for many years I always like to say that people who you know the younger generation of RSD are standing on the shoulders of giants or in our case midgets so you want to stay on these midget shoulders and let the work and let the mistakes that we've made guide you in your quest to gain competence at social interaction to gain competence at finding romance in the night with you know the object of your affections so let me give you a couple of examples here of when you know what are some what are some very basic basic rules of game well for example I'd say the number one thing that I always tell students when they come on program but the very first thing like when we're out there tonight I want you to square up in front of the girl right I want you to stand directly in front of her so you're looking her in the eye now obviously this you know does not mean that I want them to stare scare in the fucking girls eye a hundred percent at the time obviously that's weird that's lacking social intelligence but for the most part you want to be making eye contact you can glance around from time to time so it doesn't seem like this weird neuro a typical stranger like glaring at them but for the most part you want to be making eye contact and most important you want to be standing in front of them squaring up squaring up that means shoulder shoulder shoulder shoulder you're looking again there's there's no angle of attack right you're not having like of a ten-percent angle where let's say that you're the person I'm trying to pick up I wouldn't be standing like this or like this which most guys do I want to be standing like this like feel the difference even if I go like this versus this it's a lot more engagement right it's a lot more than I've made a decision to engage you when I sit right in front of you like this so that's the feeling that you want to have now many many guys I had a student this past weekend and we would tell him square up square up we even have an auditory cue that we use and we're in the word the Australian noise oi and we're yelling this yoi yoi near him and you see that he knows what it means he understands what we're attempting to communicate but the guy simply cannot square up it was just too uncomfortable for him i iose that's my assumption and I'm guessing that it probably had something to do that emotional blocks which is a topic for another video but he knew what to do yet he was flagrantly disregarding the rules and as such he wasn't getting the results that he could be another thing is uh along a similar line I was so has never approached from behind never creep up behind the girl and open her like you're leering from behind yet guys do this very consistently even they know that they're not supposed to in consequently they don't get the results that they could be getting if they simply followed this very very simple rule this isn't some abstraction that's difficult to grasp what is the front this is the front this is behind stand in front yet they flaunt these very simple rules what's another one buying drinks I had a student a couple of weeks ago it was doing well with the girl and then he bought a round of drinks for himself and the girl and I think he may have also included her friend well the girl liked him up to that point but as soon as he bought those drinks you could see her entire demeanor shift if she became like oh it's one of these guys that's attempting to perhaps curry favor with me by purchasing things for me or who knows if she even had that much of a conscious thought about it she just knew that it the dynamic changed all of a sudden she didn't respect this guy or see him in that light that she had been seeing him earlier as a potential partner and now she saw him as essentially a chump and he blew out right if he lost and he lost the set if he will she left ninety five percent of the time I find in field when a woman asked me to buy her a drink if I have not yet kissed her or otherwise established a man to woman dynamic a romantic dynamic buying that drink is gonna cause the set to blow out ninety-five percent of the time now granted there is that 5% of the time there's a 5% of the time where it's just a rule that she has like a guy that respects me by his buys a drink you know the guy has to buy me a drink for me to proceed with him and sometimes that's her rule but I said it's so small I I'd put it about 5% I've had that happen before where the girl she's like are you gonna buy me a drink I'm like it was going so well up to that point and everything in my training all of my instincts my years and years of doing this told me in every fiber of my being do not buy this drink it's going to ruin it but she was so instead of something so insistent about the way she was saying it that I kind of got like maybe this is that 5% that if I don't do it it's gonna ruin it so I asked her I'm like do you think it's a good idea for me to buy you a drink and she's like yes Jeff it is a good idea for you to just buy me this drink and I was like okay and then I bought the drink and then it worked out we actually ended up going home together and hooking up so but that is such again 5% it's nearly in infinities what what so what I'm like it's negligible right it's basically negligible and if you are a newer guy and you've only been doing this for a short time for you to just buy the drink and say well maybe it's that 5% time you simply do not have the experience necessary to know when it's that 5% even me what I did I was like everything is telling me I should do it but my experience tells me I shouldn't and I was like very conflicted and fortunately it worked out now on the other hand I've also had times where I thought it was gonna be the the exception to the rule and I went ahead and broke the rule and then and then fucked it up basically this happened to me quite recently I had a date set up through tinder and before the date the woman said she texted me and said I'm gonna be bringing my dog along is the da is the bar dog friendly and I'm coming like straight from the gym and I'm wearing my gym clothes I'm like and I said something to the effect of Wow zero fucks given huh bringing the dog in tow coming in the sweaty gym clothes she's like excuse me my dog what's wrong with my dog my beat my if you love my dog if you love me you love my dog we're a package deal and now I'm offended motherfucker and and she became offended that I was kind of suggesting she leave the at home for the romantic daytime like this doesn't sound like a romantic date to me it sounds like we're gonna have to be babysitting the dog and what if there's a problem with the dog etc and but basically she blew me out and I was like wha womp womp because I was really looking forward to going out with this girl I found her quite attractive at least from her photographs on tinder you never know but I'm pretty good at assessing that out but anyway I was you know I was quite disappointed so the very next week a similar situation came up where the woman said it was a tinder date situation I was on the phone she said something to the effect of I could meet up with you right now and I've got my dog with me and I remembered that previous week I was like oh well that ruined it last time so maybe I should just throw caution to the wind here and let her bring the dog so I said sure yeah bring the dog and to be fair the dog is really cute really cool in the bar a bit of a handful because as a puppy and kind of you know running around and stuff but it was a good time and I connected with the girl and then we came back to my house here and the dog was here and we started kissing like literally right here where I'm standing so we're I'm kissing the girl and then all of a sudden I'm like what's that and I looked down and the dog has pooped all over the room like massive amounts of dog shit all over the room like like like horse sized clumps of turds all over the room and it stinks to high heaven and there's like several like five different clumps of like horse sized manure all over my house and bedroom and it just smells like sewage and I'm like oh she's like I'm so sorry and we have like clean and then the dog peed on the carpet is or like on the hallway floor as well and I was like oh okay we got to clean up totally ruined the mood it's like oh yeah sorry well anyway I gotta go and I'm like yeah I probably go so in that case yeah I should have been like you know what let me do meetup another time when the dog is not in tow so again these rules exist for a reason right experience is born out that they should be observed the vast majority of the time now interestingly enough sometimes like I said number one with enough experience you should be able to know when to thread the needle of that like five percent exception but even then it's probably best just to observe the rule because again the vast majority of the time they're there to steer you in the right direction now what's another rule generally I tell newbies and don't when you go up to girls don't ask boring questions in fact when I was younger I had some advice from an older mentor on one of the boards he said he read some of my field reports he's like it seems like you asked these women a lot of questions like you go up and you ask boring interview questions so an exercise that he had me do was train yourself to not ask questions just say statements commands make guesses about the information you want to know and so I took that on and that was a great exercise for me to train just my mind to not go right to that well of boring interview questions and over time I learned how to operate in a way where I was contributing to the interaction and adding energy and being just being able to free associate without having to go to this well of asking questions but now today I can use boring interview style questions and it might seem like that's a subversion of the rule but in this case this isn't so much a subversion of the rule as I have cultivated the skill that the rule no longer applies so that's kind of another weird twist on the idea of rules so for example and I've told the story a couple of times I was out and in Boston with one of my assistants and we said let's do chode game tonight like as a joke sometimes we do like different styles of games said let's do chode game and what does that mean we're gonna go up and just say hey what's up and touch the girl on the back and then ask a series of boring interview questions now as we were doing this what I noticed is the girls were responding very well like it was working in other words and I was like why is this working why is this working spoke to own about this experience after the fact and basically the conclusion that we arrived at is that when most guys ask boring interview questions they're doing it because they're basically desperately treading water right they're like I hope the questions don't run out or like if the questions run out I'm up the creek without a paddle I won't know what else to do so they're going to those questions because they simply don't know what else does but for us who we've developed this ability to be voluble this ability this verbal facility where we can just blah blah blah blah blah and free associated just pulled things out of thin air and crack jokes and we're not putting a lot of pressure on ourselves and right coming at it from a defensive posture where we're trying to protect our ego we're just coming out from a proactive place we're trying to enhance the party have a fun time in conversation and actually make out with the girls etc etc so basically what has has happened it's like that old idea you learn martial arts so you don't have to fight so once we have learned this verbal facility if we do you know us my assistant I asking those boring interview style questions the girl was able to tell that we weren't doing that out of necessity we're it was a proactive decision on our part to come at it from a more laid-back place and at any moment we could be like hood again and bust out the crazy shit so again something the vast vast majority of the time follow the rules the rules exist to help you once you started to get a lot of experience under your belt you start to get an intuition kind of a spidey sense if you will for the 5% of the time that the rules should be tossed in the rubbish bin and then further beyond that there's also some rules that only exist as training wheels for a guy just starting out and then as you start to get on your feet and and fly high in the sky like a bird on high and you're actually a competent a game then those don't need to be observed at all so having said all that I hope that when you go out tonight just stick to the fundamentals the fundamentals are what that's the bread and butter your game really the flashy stuff is there for fun I've always I've always told guys this fundamentals are what is gonna get you the result on a night-in night-out consistent business so anyway I've just been an informative helpful video for you this is Jeff e and I'll see you next time I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that completely automates the process to get me dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do this is execute the program version 2.0 the ruthlessly efficient highly repeatable system for the modern day online gangster it's over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of Eden field footage broken down case study and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you polar that night  I covered the exact repeatable pattern takes to take a girl home nearly 85 percent of the time she agrees to meet ugly this is my online masterpiece at bottom line - just plain works now you have a choice to make keep using the Internet to beat off or use it to have someone else beat it off for you so decide Oh fasten one started getting laid and execute the program [Music],cQeEJyoQ6_E
what up it's red disheveled proverbial boy coming at you today from my backyard garden out here by the good old hot tub in this little oasis of love that I have painstakingly created and today I want to talk about my experiences dicking around with plants working with RSD since 2002 and you know that's do the math right as of this filming in 2018 it's 16 whole years I've been running live in fill boot camps hot seats free tours and cities all over the world so what that means is I'm bringing the  real in these videos so real in these videos so please take a quick moment to like and subscribe is I'm bringing your new content from these trenches and these streets every week okay so anyway our programs have continually evolved since 2002 one would hope so at least eventually becoming the life-changing juggernauts that they are today but a few things have remained the same throughout all of these years for example at the very beginning of a boot camp I like to do like a little meet-and-greet with the guys basically I ask them where they're from what they do for a living what kind of hobbies they like to indulge in and you can actually tell a lot about a guy by the things that he chooses to do in his spare time and as a rule of thumb I found that the guys who do the best on boot camp are typically the ones whose hobbies involved some kind of physical activity or and/or some kind of creative outlet like say for example playing music and you know I'm not entirely sure why but that's just been an observation that I've made over the years through you know my empirical data if you will and I think of martial artists in particular these guys understand that there's gonna be a bit of an ego crushing learning curve and these guys have a tendency to come in with realistic expectations of what's required and what can it like realistically be expected and musicians are not these other creative types on the other hand these people are typically pretty in tune with their self-expression and I think that's why they do well and again that's just my two cents on the other hand if I asked a guy what his hobbies are and the dude just kind of looks at me with this blank stare and says I don't know or like nothing well then I know that I'm probably gonna be in free bit of a rough weekend right and of course it's never entirely wise to indulge in generalizations okay sometimes the biggest pimps will have some fairly esoteric interests that don't necessarily lend themselves directly to pickup for example as you might be able to determine I'm pretty hardcore into gardening of all things right people see my Instagram to like what's this it's like a retiree right yeah okay gardening okay I'm a planter alright way back in the day when I was nineteen twenty I worked at a nursery for a period of several years not with children but with the plants and initially I took the job just like you discounts on supplies as at the time I was a pretty avid cultivator of what we called manchurian fern tomatoes quote-unquote but during my tenure at this nursery I did everything I couldn't just like soaked up cortical horticultural knowledge like a sponge right like everything from the different diseases to landscape architecture soil amendment you know I used to grow roses and I would like enter them in rose shows I would install lawns I cloned specimens from cuttings I advised homeowners on you know native plant its installations etcetera etc etc so in any case those those days are obviously long gone now but I still have a little place in my heart for the botany and if you ever meet me in person if you look closely at my thumb you can still see a little bit of a little bit of green on there okay in fact last summer well I wasn't back in town on hiatus from my little Jeffy hopsie euro tour I decided to take back my yard here from the wild because I had neglected it for a couple of years and it had become overrun with weeds like tons of weeds random debride crap right so I hired a couple of dudes off the corner to like clear it all out went to the garden center got some stuff rolled up my sleeves and you know dug in and so a couple of months later as you can see the space is totally transformed and it is similar quite similar in fact to heaven a heaven when you can get your ball sucked in a hot tub by multiple girls who are half your age while you're actually like standing up in the middle of it mist coming off of you as though you're Gandalf okay so so anyway I was out here this morning puttering around look you know doing a little pruning doing a little weeding etc staking up some of these sunflowers they got so big they're falling over and so it got me to thinking about some of the parallels between pickup and gardening now you might be thinking what the hell like and I agree on the surface it sounds a bit tenuous a bit ridiculous but you gotta understand you're talking to a guy who eats breeds and sleeps pick up 24/7 so it really shouldn't be that surprising that I would draw some kind of parallel okay so what what are the lessons that we can glean here now one thing I've noticed about maintaining my garden you know I really do have to be out here every couple of days in order to assess the whole scenario right so I come out here snip away some dead stuff you know give it the water ruthlessly yank out in you know these weeds that have started to sprout up and as I'm like combing through these beds here pulling these weeds out one by one by one I become completely immersed in the activity which of them to the point where I kind of barely even noticed the time passing I could be out here for an hour I look up and like oh an hours passed and it's the same with like dealing with the hottub here you know cleaning out the pubes I should really get an assistant for that fixing the chemicals etc etc I get very very focused on the task at hand and you know there's others obviously an overarching plan for how I want everything to turn out but that's merely providing the framework okay and so think about how this is true for your game as well if you want to cultivate like a really really slick game right a really slick skillset you've got to be out there a lot and that means going out with regularity and it's going out and talking to girls going out an approaching with regularity plain and simple you can't hope to get there by merely like playing around with it when the fancy happens to strike especially if you're a new guy personally you know even me like at this advanced stage if I had neglected for a few weeks out here in the yard like I'd go out here the weeds have choked out my azaleas back here and consequently if I hang out at home and just play xbox you know without human contact for a couple of months and then I go to the club well yeah my games gonna be filled with all kinds of weeds as well I'm gonna be rolling out there with some kind of like autistics I'm gonna Howard Hughes like you know man handed me the drink with your left hand only and you know something like that right okay so it's gonna be weird so you have to have a consistent and concerted effort put forth so with consistency you're gonna you're gonna succeed provided of course you're intelligent about your growth and you're willing to put yourself under that microscope i ka weeding out disempowering behaviors so to speak and planting the seeds of new empowering ones and this is gonna be a constant battle and this battle will never ever end you know until you're in the ground till you're dead that is now if you haven't read the book mastery by George Leonard yet I suggest you should do this immediately okay it's a very small concise book packs a lot of value and you can check that out along with all my other book recommendations @j Lacs jl AIX comm forward slash books okay and in this book leonard outlines the path to a true mastery of skill of a skill as opposed to you know what he calls dabbling or hacking and reading this book the biggest principle that stuck out for me was the idea that masters practice solely for the sake of practicing in other words they take massive enjoyment and the actual development of the skill and you know the results the the accolades the wins the getting laid these are all mere side effects okay they're the bonus or the icing on the cake now granted a cake does kind of suck without icing on it but still it's not that it's not the main substance I have a buddy who this guy named owl and he's uh he was really into jiu-jitsu and he once told me about this jiu-jitsu instructor he had out in Hawaii because he's from Hawaii right so this is this dude this instructor he was like a nutcase he'd like literally have two broken hands and see some guy in the street he didn't like and fight the guy with two broken hands you know like just like a lunatic right and so one day my buddy owls that practice jiu-jitsu practice and that this instructor is like literally grinding his face into the floor and like almost breaking his arm off and all of a sudden the instructor just screams out he's like you like this this is why you come here you love this and him the way he related the story to me he's like at that moment as strange and possibly disturbing as that may have sounded I will realize that the instructor was right right see my buddy here he's not like a guy who sweats the process he actually loves the process of learning itself going into that gym day after day like rolling his way through the drills like sweating it out etc etc and consequently this is a guy that's developed into a very very skilled BJJ practitioner you know he's a purple belt now so from shouting about with these plants we can observe some fundamental yet powerful lessons about our game and these are as follows okay number one your practice needs to be consistent okay examine yourself pluck those weeds out of your game on a daily basis preferably while they're small little sproutlets okay because once they get big it's it's more of a pain in the ass to actually root them out okay so that's number one and number two learn to enjoy the process itself viewing it almost as a meditative exercise right lose yourself in it our old buddy Eckhart Tolle a the author of a new earth and power of now he outlines this process in three steps okay number one acceptance to enjoyment and three enthusiasm so you really want to allow yourself to experience all three of these modalities while you're in the club and then you're gonna sit back kind of watch the magic happen so on that note let me just sweep up the dirt okay roll up my my giant hose that's a double me it's like a triple meaning yeah and say to you farewell until next time  you,dZspJB57Do0
hey there so check it out I've been thinking a lot lately about what exactly makes a successful pickup and what I mean by that is what are the common threads in every successful approach that I've done so I was thinking about this this afternoon and I sat there and I was I thought about it a lot and then I thought some more was it proper execution of fundamentals well yeah that sort of goes without saying was it some kind of like inner game secret well now that was a bit too ephemeral I was looking for something more concrete and eventually I just got pissed off and I threw the television out the front window I was like fuck this this is just too much thinking and that's when it came to me the common thread to all my successful pickups absence of thought that's right no thinking in all of my most spectacular successes I was looking completely in the moment without concern for the next move or what to say or any of this type of stuff in all these cases I was able to just let go and let the training take over okay I put faith in my abilities and my skills and I let them guide me like Luke Skywalker turning off his computer controls as he makes his final approach on the Death Star alright that's gonna be the last Star Wars reference that you will ever hear in this view however the point is this you must be present in the moment present at the moment at all times or some paper you can plot out the stages of a pickup and you can kind of plan everything out and it seems pretty black and white but once you hit the field it's a different story entirely out there you got things coming at you from all directions and they're often coming at you very quickly so a split-second response time is necessary and there's no way they're gonna be able to pull that off if you're not present but rather you're somewhere off in the back of your head looking at some bizarre pie chart of your own twisted devising so this is all very zen so anyway I let all this roll around in my head for a while and I didn't think about it mind you I just sort of let it fester in my brain until it crystallized and this is what I was left with thinking bad nonsense and utter stupidity good so this then is my new method which I wholeheartedly endorse nonsense and utter stupidity now typically I wouldn't even bother to elaborate on this as the very act of doing so would go against the tenets of the nonsense and utter stupidity philosophy but I'll make an exception in this case because you might homie so now I know you're probably saying ok Jeff I get it it's important to be present to the moment during an interaction you should read some more tole bro but the thing is it goes far deeper than that so you know while that's all esoteric and everything there are actually some ways to practically apply this philosophy and that's what I'm going to explain right here so first of all what is the number one reason that guys fail at pickup well first off point-blank period it's they don't understand how attraction attraction works specifically they think that logic has something to do with attraction when in fact it has almost nothing to do with it so the process of attraction is predicated almost entirely on emotion and this is the reason that most guys fail they might work hard to buy a sports car or take girls out to some elaborate expensive dinner thinking that it's gonna impress the girls and that's caused them to become attracted to them but the problem with this is while expensive dinner and luxury cars of course very nice things they are logical things not emotional and while these things may contribute to your happiness and they're obviously great in that respect they have nothing to do with the process of attraction and in fact by bragging about having such things it can actually have the opposite of the desired effect as doing so sub communicates neediness which is perhaps the most undesirable equality of them all so this over reliance on logic is the gaping hole in most guys game you can drive a Mack truck through and this is why I can shut most guys down so easily in the field so let's say that my buddy is in a mixed set which you know a group we've got both guys and girls and there's some guy in it that's interfering with my friend attempting to control the interaction and game the girls himself what do I do simple I roll in and I'll start bombarding the guy with logical questions in a friendly manner and what will happen is that the guy will typically engage me in this boring and logical conversation and as he does so any attraction that he is built with the girl will start to plummet immediately and the beauty of this is that he doesn't even realize it's happening as it all seems just like an innocuous attempt by a boring yet friendly guy me to be social unless of course we're talking about a guy who's as they say in TV tropes genre savvy but that's fairly rare and it's not what we're talking about here you know this is just a normal guy he may realize that something is going awry but he's not gonna be able to pinpoint it or do anything about it until it's too late because meanwhile my buddy swoops in and he steals all the attraction for himself as he continues to game up his intended girl unmolested so this is made possible by guys ignorant of how the process of Attraction works their assumption that it's based on logic is their weakness let me illustrate for you another practical application of the nonsense and utter stupidity school of thought many times when you approach a girl she's gonna throw various tests you're way over the course of the interaction as a way to screen out undesirables and this is a good thing because if the girls throwing these tests your way it means that she's viewing you as a potential sex partner if you were something like child or something like 90 year old mother fucker she wouldn't even think of doing this so if you're getting them it means you're doing something right maybe not everything right but you're doing something right like some girls say that to me other nations like Geoff the fact that you have so many haters means that you're you must be doing something right I'm like true but probably not everything but anyway anyway so these tests they can take many forms they can be pointed enquiries you know is this your pickup line do you say that to all the girls they can be blatant insults like your fucking short aren't you or your shirt looks fucking stupid right but your response to these tests will determine your success or failure so with that in mind it would do really well to think long and hard about your responses to these tests right wrong remember attraction is all about emotions so when the girl bust your balls in many ways it's an attempt to get you to go logical you see they know that if you get them emotional they will likely sleep with you so they attempt to put the brakes on the process by going logical if you take the bait you're sunk there mind you very little of this is taking place on a conscious level in the chicks head but if the girl tests you and starts getting all pissy what do you do well the classic response to this is of course you're gonna want to change her mood not her mind so instead of addressing the test in a logical manner and getting sucked into that trap buffed out some nonsense might ignore the comment stick out your tongue tickler bust out some utter stupidity reply with some bizarre non sequitur that has nothing whatsoever to do with what she said right she's like what the fuck why didn't you say that that's totally offensive might be like well yes that may very well be true however let me ask you this do you believe in Harry Potter just like what Harry Potter what and I'm like yeah blah but other than that a bowl and the million dollar mouthpiece just keeps rolling on and it gets plowed under so the power of utter stupidity cannot be overstated now sometimes I'll use it to keep the girls in state when the energy in the interaction is kind of flagging so Energy's going down no attract material immediately springs to mind well time for some gibberish that makes no goddamn sense I might jump in the air with a spinning uppercut in scream how do weekend right so the chicks are laughing and I roll back into my regularly scheduled game let's say I'm pulling some girl back to Club Chevy which is my euphemism for my home and she's beginning to get bored in the car on the ride there well time to rock the stupidity might start calling her like a mischievious munchkin in the night then like singing some little like now Cat songs like ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am man but ma'am it you know for the duration of the entire ride home just bantering with this sort of nonsensical gibberish to keep the Cascade of positive emotions rolling the entire way so try this stuff out it's trimly powerful one caveat here though if you're gonna do this stuff you've got to be congruent if you're gonna pull it off so if you start making weird ass noises but internally you're thinking damn I sound like a fucking buffoon well guess what she's probably going to agree with that sentiment another great area to apply the the concepts of nonsense and other stupidity to is is the initial approach so many times guy shoots himself in the foot before they even approach because of approach anxiety and what happens is they see the hot girl they pause they want her then they pause and they begin to cycle through different scenarios in their head like what's the best opener oh no that one will sound dumb what if she thinks on lame what if that guy is a boyfriend durka durka durka etc etc etc so finally if she hasn't left by this point the new finally musters up the courage to approach but the problem is now their opener sounds totally stilted and contrived because of all this internal pollution floating around in their head enter the stupidity so when you see the girl kill all thoughts you just can't afford to be thinking in these situations as your brain can only process so much so you need to focus all your energy in the moment and just go you take a deep breath and you make your fucking feet start moving alright you don't think you start walking there's no guarantee that you're gonna succeed but without all that junk in your head tainting the broadcast you're much more likely to sub communicate attractive qualities and respond to things in the correct way be here now as the old 60s head trip gurus used to say you put faith in your training let the piece has fallen to them they've fallen in place now this of course is assuming that you've been going out and actually learning the mechanics of game this assumes a basic understanding of the mechanics of game for this to actually work so understand that well anyway I can't feel my fingers it's pretty cold out here so I guess it's time to wrap things up and in the interest of keeping my stupidity honed to a dull edge I'm now going to go home and watch several hours of network television talk you in a few days,eCPyePdm3Ag
sheppy here in Miami Florida I got the iconic skyline behind me and it's videoblog time so check it out once upon a time a friend of mine suggested that I was misogynistic and I believe his exact words were you know Jeff you love sex but you view women as an obstacle to getting sex well you know I got to respond to this because I think this whole issue is very important and even integral to success in the arena of social dynamics so let's take a minute right here now so I can explain how I feel okay back when I was a kid I thought that women should be you know worshipped and and put on put upon a pedestal and I would see players and frat boys and these types of you know these types of characters that would get with a lot of girls and I my impression was that these are horrible people you know these people are evil and harmful to women okay and I thought that you know the correct way to go about things was to buy girls gifts and you know show them really show them how much you care with impassioned letters and poems and all this kind of stuff all right I did not get laid much at all big surprise then after a couple of seriously screwed up long-term relationships where I got burned pretty bad I you know I decided to become a player okay I'm like you know what it's time to turn the tables now it's time for me to have the power I'm gonna be a straight-up dog yo okay you know the kind of guy that never calls the girls back you know never buys them anything under any circumstances in other words a total jerk so I fumbled and stumbled around at this for a while you know with very limited success but then I learned about I learned about game in the community and I and I hooked up with the boys from RSD and as I started to learn what real game was my attitude changed once more and I realized that a great deal of that whole bitches and hos attitude of those posturing so-called players was in many cases the result of their frustration at being incapable of scoring with anything other than you know drunken Sorata toots high on rohypnol so so now armed with game I began to develop a newfound respect for women and that's when I started to get really good alright but as I got more and more success and understanding I actually had to wonder all this crazy stuff I see girls doing field actually made me start to question my new beliefs I mean for those of you who are just starting out if you're going to see some stuff in the field that will just not make any sense to you that could blow your mind and it might even make you think that girls are like these evil truly like evil creatures from hell okay you know for example how they'll sometimes cheat on their boyfriends in a heartbeat without you know without hesitation and then just completely backwards rationalize that it was okay okay how they can you know be totally fickle you know for example you're talking to a girl in the club she's totally into you and you leave for a second to go take a piss and then when you come back she's all up on some other dude and you're like what the hell man you know all that buying temperature that I just I just spent building up she just as soon as I leave she just transfers it immediately to the next shiny alpha male that rolls up despite the fact that we've been talking have this incredible connection for an hour alright how they'll sleep with you just because you're saying journey at the karaoke bar okay maybe that maybe that one's just me but the point is there's got to be a way to reconcile this stuff with your belief systems when you acknowledge as you must that there is no such thing as the perfect person or the perfect interaction in fact there's only the idea of it then the real purpose of striving for that perfection becomes clear and that's to make people happy and to me ultimately that's what the game is all about at the fundamental level we're just animals we're all just animals with some very base motivations for our actions okay both men and women all right at the end of the day when nothing but mammals okay with some very base motivations for our actions and in other words you've got to take the bad with the good okay a major source of pleasure for me is found in having respect for the women I'm interacting with have your respect for the other people in the club I'm interacting with and truly wanting them to feel good in my presence okay you know when I'm in the club I want people and I'm gonna reckon with people I want their night to be slightly better for having you interact with me I wanted to be slightly more interesting slightly more fun I want to put a smile on their face okay because to me to go up and run like a some sloppy set where the focus is solely on my petty need for outcome okay without regard for the overall vibe and energy I'm putting out to people and into the universe in general well you know this is not only a waste of the potential sex as it will not likely work but it's also a waste of the potential of pleasing that particular woman respect for the women you are interacting with is a respect for life for who we are and what we do and it's important to remind yourself of that you know I've certainly lost sight of that from time to time and that's kind of why I'm addressing it in this blog today in fact to reiterate it to myself but to give pleasure you have to take pleasure yourself for me it's the satisfaction of being in the field and experiencing the process okay really being process oriented as opposed to outcome oriented and enjoying the process you know the process of you know going out there and just in hitting the zone and improvi ng like coming up with some new hilarious jokes or lines okay or maybe you know picking a girl up and posting her over my shoulder and carrying her around the club and like you know laughing like a maniac okay or you know charming her fret her trapping her peer group when they initially dislike me or even you know during the daytime when I'm at home hitting up my phone numbers you know via text in the phone game so these are the mechanical jobs that we do daily year after year and this is the big challenge to maintain passion for the everyday routine and the endlessly repeated act okay to derive deep gratification from the mundane uh let me give you an example say you're in the club and you want to hit up an extremely difficult looking group so you know you might look at the group and think to yourself you know you know man you know I'm gonna have to roll up and I have those dudes those alpha dude she's with or they're gonna be up in my face within two seconds her backs towards me you know she seems kind of aloof she has like kind of aloof expression on her face so I'm probably gonna have to plow through that and those two obese girls with the warts on their face that she's with probably aren't going to help things too much either right but it's doing those things launching your weapons in just the right time calibrating everything befriending the peer group that is the game and it is one of my favorite things to do the idea of pickup and the idea of studying or writing about pickup aren't to be somewhat in conflict okay there's an inherent contradiction between prescribed routines or Internet postings and videos which are documents and a pickup artist who is an evolving soul not easily transcribed in method form a method has no soul you as the player must bring soul to the method alright these methods and techniques they've been painstakingly documented but they should ultimately be used as tools rather than an exact blueprint you can read the mechanics you know specific lines or bits for example but you know your lines are going to be perfect if you merely follow the script if you don't feel it it's not going to be perfect no matter how well you recite the lines okay on the other hand if it's not really a perfect interaction you're running per se if you're making little mistakes here and there but overall you've maintained a great feeling for it well then you've run the interaction perfectly because there was that passion behind what you did so these methods that you read about then are merely guidelines I mean dude listen you're not going to be able to replicate me or Tyler or Julian or any of the other rst instructors you may be able to create something that in composition resembles what we did but more importantly you're going to create something that you have a deep respect and feelings and passion for and you know what it's going to be more satisfying than anything that we could do for you until next time I'm out [Music] confession confession confession confession confession fission and fusion and fission,fMLBDy_tFwE
"whatup Jeff here today I want to do a little mailbag shit so I got a variety of topics here that I culled from the internet so let's get right to it okay let's do it this guy asks Jeff if the quality of women in San Francisco is bad why still live there I mean you'll get laid anywhere look okay this guy's from Facebook so I know it's like a kid kid getting laid is in everything motherfucker you understand get that in your thick skull because well if you're a kid probably the top of your skull still undeveloped your little soft spot there so just you know get us get this through your soft spot pick up is not life okay it's important it's important part of life and your happiness you know you obviously want to be have the ability to go out and interact with members of the opposite sex or same-sex you know no judgment here and get it on but it should not be the overarching focus of your life in fact if it is that can be deeply counterproductive right deeply deeply counterproductive why because you'll be sub communicating that you know you need this to work right you need when you're talking to the girl you need it to work and as we all know hopefully hopefully you know neediness is perhaps the most unattractive characteristic of all so you want to have override this way always caution like you know when I get like emails from kids in high school saying how do I learn pickup it's like don't you don't study do your fuckin studies kid I mean I didn't get laid till I was 19 years old not saying that I would I wouldn't have loved to you know but I had a variety of little girlfriends and I know plenty of guys that you know play on my friends got lay it at a very young age 13 years old 12 years old even and that's all well and fine but I don't think it should be an overarching part of your life at that young age why and I've said this before because it's very easy to become consumed by pickup and yours this pickup weirdo has no other outside interests so you know not to say don't do it but again don't let it be very careful that it doesn't come assume you San Francisco it's a wonderful place to live we have some of the best food in the country and for in terms of restaurants and the cuisine you know some might argue New York versus the west coast I look New York's all about technique we have the best ingredients on the west coast all right which amazing dining the city itself looks like a movie it's absolutely beautiful the air quality is wonderful you got a variety variety of nature just a short drive away you got Tahoe for the skiing you can go up to uh you know Muir Woods down the peninsula there's some stuff there too you know it's just it's a great great place to live aside from the astronomic rent the I believe the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is now close to 4,000 a month thanks tech Bros but um you know want to live here you got to make more money so you know it's like I really enjoy it here obviously the women I'd say look is it like some TED like people get this impression that there's like it's like Mordor where you see like these like hunchbacks of no true DOM and various orcs and she had goblins like all right like like you know lumbering through the streets in reality it's simply that first of all there aren't like safe compare/contrast of Los Angeles where every girl who thinks that she can make a living off of her looks gravitates towards to be in that industry you know you're obviously beauty is going to be less of a commodity down there because that's where the beautiful people go quote-unquote furthermore there's more of an emphasis in other cities like Las Vegas Miami New York the nightlife will tend to have more people that the girls will dress up right they'll dress up in other words you know they will wear a cocktail dress they'll wear heels they'll spend a lot of time on their cosmetics and their hair but you know a lot of the time you'll you'll get with one of these girls and you'll get her home and the next morning you see without all the makeup and shit on sigh holy fuck did I like pull a construction worker what the hell is this so so it's again like you know everyone's after the costume comes off a lot times the girls will look the same if not better here in San Francisco you just got to look harder and you know there's less of a premium on that here there's less of a emphasis on sort of superficial standards of beauty in fact people here almost seem to take a perverse Glee in actively bucking that trend that's we see a lot of women dressing in like plaid loose-fitting plaid shirts and you know jeans and things of that nature but you know it I'd say look you can find attractive girls here absolutely you know my my girlfriend who I'm I've been dating for several years I've met here and she is objectively quite attractive the point is this is not teeming with like these model caliber girls but there's a lot of different reasons why I live here aside from aside from that to answer your question so let's see let's take another one here this guy says who lies more men or women the answer fuck you uh the see here okay how do you like to show intent while balancing it with freedom from outcome now I think that the premise of this question itself is misguided okay because you're seeing these things intense on the one hand and then having freedom from outcome if we're talking about when you're interacting with a woman the guy's interacting with a woman in a in a cold approach scenario you're regarding these two things are somehow diametrically opposed like if you have one it's an opposition to the other now again a lot of this is well-worn territory here but when we're talking about freedom from outcome it doesn't mean that you're like I don't give a shit if the girl like is into me or not I don't care like obviously I don't give a shit if i hook up with the girl or not obviously the intention is to have a romantic encounter however fleeting but um what I'm talking I'm talking about freedom from a ten basically what I mean is this I'm not looking to the girls reaction it's to as a metric for whether or not my approach was a success in my mind because the point is no matter how sick your fucking game is there are certain people who are just never gonna be in - never be attracted to you and you have to accept that in fact you know this belief that with proper application of game principles you can make anyone like you it's rooted in like a almost disturbing form of entitlement where you're assuming that people you know why wouldn't think everyone has to love me everyone has to love you basically freedom from outcome simply means you accept that you're for some not for others right I I understand some people aren't going to get with my particular brand of idiocy other girls are going to think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread the bee's knees what have you you know and I know this I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror I'm like there's Jeff you know a person with strengths weaknesses like everyone else and I kind of look down I'm like well I'm 40 years old I guess this is how it turned out and if they don't like it sorry you know I've accepted I've accepted the fact that there's a certain element of randomness that you can never get over right and no matter how many you know no matter how sick your game is I'm at one point your your behavior is you might just meet some girls having a bad day who just doesn't like guys of your particular you know doesn't like your type maybe you're wearing a shirt that she doesn't like maybe she's married maybe she is a bona fide lesbian you have no idea who you're approaching before you approach so freedom for Malcolm simply means accepting that not everyone is going to like you it's and that's okay you're not going to be vaporized it's it's their right to not like you okay everyone has a right to not like you so the thing is what I'm talking about free from outcome like I said I'm not looking towards the girls reaction to see as a metric for whether we was successful again the focus needs to be internal so if I go up I'm like did I approach her for starters did I approach that I say if I saw a girl I was attracted to did I approach her number two did I communicate that I was interest in her romantically as opposed to platonically okay and hopefully you're doing that in a smooth way as was real like I'm saying what's up baby you want some dick you know although that does work in certain scenarios certain people in like a club may like that um so again did I approach was a communicating intent and third was I amusing myself as opposed to trying to weasel my way into their party so in other words am i leaching energy or am i adding energy so again if I'm doing those three things in my mind I approach I communicate as a man to a woman as opposed to a friend or friend and I and I am going in with the intention to have a good time as opposed to that you know somehow make her make it work or have her buoy my state up if I do those three things and she's still not into it again I don't see it as rejection I see it as a simple lack of chemistry and I move on if there if I did make any procedural errors like any glaring procedural errors like qualifying myself or you know pushing too hard uh verbally or you know even physically for that matter and she like got creeped out I didn't I didn't appropriately respond and back off with statement of empathy etcetera you know if I made any procedural nuts and bolt errors I'll note it noted in my mind it's that neural pathway a little more so the next time I won't make that same mistake and I move on right so that's what we talked about like when I go up I'm in tenth full she knows that I'm there to you know to again pursue a romantic relationship with her she definitely knows that but at the end of the day or the end of the interaction if she's not into it that's fine too that's all it means okay so anyway quick little bee blog here hope you enjoyed it I'll be back next week you like this please subscribe like and

what's up it's Owen and Jeff from real social dynamics welcome to the crib up in Hollywood and what we be talking to you about today was the Super Bowl where Tom Brady and the Patriots beat the Atlanta Falcons and the major topic if you are football fan and enjoyed watching that game we're gonna make a quick timely video for you is that as a veteran one of the really cool things that you learn even as you lose your youth and you don't maybe have that youthful energy anymore as a veteran what you have is the ability to carve out a place in your mind where even when you're tired even if you're sick even if you're under a lot of pressure even if you're maybe a little bit outside your paygrade as far as what you're used to doing you can kind of just pull it together and do it anyway and you know for me being 37 you just turned 40 right 41 41 okay look um basically one of the advantages that you know both of us have noticed is that you know even when you're kind of fucked up you can just do it so Jeff right now actually a a little bit of sick a little bit of tired right now and kind of fucked up and he's like dude let's just go shoot anyway I don't give a fuck we're just going to shoot and the reason that Jeff is able to do that and that I've done that many times is because we're veteran well to be honest honestly right now I probably you know look so I have botulism probably no vomit immediately after finishing this filming maybe vomit on you on these guys behind the camera but just not the camera any of us been on the camera long surcharge is not the fucking camera but you know regardless this probably giving in like this video but here's the deal it's like even as a 41 year old guy one would think it's interesting because when I was in my 30s I kind of felt like  disheartened you know I thought it was weird for me to be hooking up with these 21 year old girls and you know I was like I was this old guy that was getting away with murder and my time had come and so on and so forth but as I got older at the groom are accustomed to operating in that milieu you know when you're the younger guy you got athleticism you got then vigor you're able to go endlessly or fucking tank but that shear at medicine if you will and that's going to fade and in order to stay relevant to stay competitive you're going to have to learn to cultivate a variety of techniques that are going to allow you to stay on top like look for example the great pitcher nolan ryan who retired i believe that the advanced age was at forty seven or something like that again i'm sure that's probably not right or Gordie Howe 50 what enabled that guy who he knows joints are shit his ability to stamina isn't it is what it used to be what enables him to compete at a super high elite level at that advanced age its technique well just saying right now the reason you want to do this video is because he's super fuck things like I'm just going to do it anyway and that's something that I really relate with personally and to me you know getting older I definitely have to surround myself with younger people in game to motivate me to approach a lot I definitely have to surround myself with younger motivated people to push me in work so being motivated is not just this magical thing where the person makes it look effortless it's actually something that you kind of set around yourself to motivate yourself but the thing that I'm really proud of is I got older is that no matter how fucked up I am I can sort of find the space in my mind where I can block out what's going on and focus on the task at hand so if you look at the Super Bowl Tom Brady I think would happen to him with it the the Atlanta Falcons just go in there and they're just like mad we're not even supposed to be here if I want to get pussy at our Thomas in the land I don't give a shit this is fun we're the fuckin suburb awful hot mom you know there's having fun so they started dominating the first half or maybe even three quarters of the game because they're in it's really high vibration state the quarterback for landed pupils are really big everybody's just having fun scoring just everything he was throwing at the Patriots was just working and Tom Brady the veteran could barely get anything to go and in my opinion what was happening there was Tom was not just fighting against the outcome dependents of the Super Bowl but the outcome dependents of history and the outcome dependents of you know maybe to some people at least to some people becoming arguably the best quarterback of all time you know kind of surpassing Joe Montana in the eyes of some people so he was very outcome dependent that's why we teach don't be outcome dependent so his natural abilities were shut down finally went ahead to a point where it looks like he's going to lose he came back from the high deficit in a Super Bowl that's ever happened they went to overtime which is the first time that's ever happened in Super Bowl according to what I thought what the commentators are saying and then he won which is so crazy and at the end he just dominated it was just buh-buh-buh like you just knew everything is going to do is going to work why because he understands these different nuances of places to go in your mind when you're tired when you're sick when you're under demonic amounts of pressure to make yourself do it so some of those for example are we're just going to do one plate at a time mentally challenging yourself to do one play at a time they also say that a great quarterback has has a has a short memory great quarterback has a short memory you start losing you start missing throws forget about it keep moving another one is like again that outcome dependence you've got to go weight when it doesn't matter what history is it's this particular play let's do it and then what happens that initially when the Falcons have momentum what happens that the minds the quote-unquote winner effect you should look that up basically when you're winning your mind kind of opens up and you get really confident free and loose the winner effect for the Atlanta Falcons was just in full force so they had all the momentum but then as Brady eventually realize I'm going to lose and then he kind of just gave up probably in a certain way just kind of like going well this is it Mize let's enjoy it for what it is then I'll you know I don't think you ever you know would say I'm out of the game but at a certain point he's not he's like well I'm not playing for history anymore I'm kind of like a little fun try to like make a game out of this and then all of a sudden he starts getting momentum now of a sudden that 39 years almost 40 years of experience starts to take hold and all of a sudden the moment is so big at the moment it's too big for the Falcons and you know a lot of it was lucky a lot of it was like these lucky plays as well I don't think that the outcome is like truly determinant everything because a lot of it is luck for sure including a lucky coin toss so to be fair but in my mind what happened was this basically he got into momentum so for me when I do videos on the road for example something I really pride myself in is like what Jeff just suggested here I'll be on very little sleep because I'm running a boot camp or a hot seat recently I even had food poisoning on my way out to New York and I was on the plane throwing up from this bad food that I ate and the most fun thing to me is challenging myself this throw up dude so this I was not feeling spectacular and so one of the most fun to me is being up there when I'm sick and finding that place in my mind I'm like wow there's this place in my mind that five years ago I didn't have and it's this place where I can just tweak little things in my perception and find a place where the moment isn't too big and just do it and that's the fun part of getting older for me it's kind of funny too because you got to ask yourself like how many times has a guy like Tom Brady for example been in a position like that maybe not as momentous of a game but in you know it's a very similar situation where nothing's gone right and he's able to get find that place and move forward and the ability to do what they did tonight is a result of all those experiences like for example you know I've done several grueling tours all over the world where your your sleep your living out of a suitcase every instructors done this max is done you've done it Julian certainly done it and it just makes you think in retrospect you're back home and you're finally sitting there and you're unpacked back home you're like I did that and you know you could do it again or a launch for that matter where you're you know you literally might be working literal 16 to 18 hour days sleeping wake up rolled right back into the studio and start writing the copy prepped into the side etc etc you know putting the finishing touches on the program program itself and having gone through that in the future I know that I'll carry that forward with me forever you know if I ever want to launch an other product I want to help someone else launch a product I have that ability to do that it's trusting your faculties reflecting the experiences you've been through are going to are going to carry you through but of course how do you get there you've got to put yourself through the fucking fire in order to be able to reap the benefits that comes with that right okay grabbing to let them wrap up now so they can sit down I guess the latter can say is my most glorious moments is doing game after that break up what I'm in pain what when I'm so good that I can't do that approach it is when I'm on days of shitty sleep and I don't like to be that one but when it has happened and then I just gave anyway it's when I'm up in front of that 600 person crowd and I feel like I'm gonna die that like restaurant it's like what are you gonna fuckin die and even if you did die isn't that where you tell you wanna die with you did a great video that would make the best video ever it's been Jeffy Owen and we'll see you next time  [Music],fQPBeL-jZwg
for the negative aspects let's give me this type of lifestyle well the negative aspects of living this type of lifestyle is I basically have fucking face tattoos at this point let's just put it this way I'm not running for fucking city council anytime soon I may run for City Council in Omaha Nebraska because that is my escape plan after I've burned all of my bridges and fucked up my life irreparably in every area I'm going to go to Omaha Nebraska which Forbes magazine said is the number one metropolitan area in the United States in terms of bang for your buck and I'm going to become a Juggalo which is a fan of the Insane Clown Posse what are some of the best experiences you've happened when I stand best experience I'm half from one ice and um damn is this like family-friendly this document we're gonna start off the documentary with Julian pounding a girl in ass literally I will live I don't know I mean look a one-night stand I can say that I've had many positive experiences from multiple night stands you know where I met someone and had it you know cultivated a deeper relationship with them if even for a period of weeks but you know the one-night stands you tend to kind of not remember it's kind of more of a sexual merry-go-round they all kind of blur together I'd say the one-night stand experience in and of itself is the best experience of the one-night stand what is the what is the point of sleeping with so many women and what does it do for you the point is the point is there is no point I am essentially what you might call an absurdist in the tradition of Camus and Sartre I feel that there is no essential meaning to our universe at least not one that we are capable of discerning in any meaningful way and as such the best that we can do is attempt to cultivate our own meeting via the search itself while simultaneously realizing that this may have no intrinsic value what are your feelings for the person you're with in a moment now this is kind of an interesting one because I know a lot of players are these kind of callous people who don't really have much feelings for the people they're with however I dare say that in order to be effective at this you actually need to develop feelings for that person on a very in a very real way at least in a transitory sense I mean after the fact who knows right there she's basically like my world if you will do you tell all the girls about the others or is it discretionary well okay it's kind of like gays in the military you know Don't Ask Don't Tell um but I don't need to tell because it's glaringly obvious by it just basically seeps out of the pores you know I get this from time to time you know have clients and they'll say things like well how do you tell you know the lastest would you tell the girls how do you bring it up it's like if you're if you're worrying about how you're gonna bring it up you've already fucked up because again there's no need in fact any girl that I'm with for like any length of time she knows better than to ask about details now of course if you're in a long-term relationship that's something that that's kind of rules that need to be worked out you know how much do you want to know right how much are we obligated to tell each other that kind of thing I'd say though again I know with previous girlfriends and I've had you know say they call me up and even like so-called fuck buddies that I have you know if they call me up and they're like hey do you want to go out tonight I'll just say I can't I can't today there's no explanation why and frankly they know better than to ask further because they may not like the answer right they may not like it do you think what you do is normal absolutely not I think it's highly abnormal look do you ever get criticism from your actions it's a serious question yeah of course they had fucking criticized for my action I can lambaste it in the fucking mainstream media for being like a vulgar douche tard like I'm like basically the fucking Justin Bieber of this shit like look at this little cunt going around doing this shit ha to that I mean look I go to the gym and all often watch these programs something called Trisha something called Wendy something called dissing that I and it's all the same thing Evon ESPN Skip Bayless and all these fucktards para Dame a mainstream media diatribe like it's basically look my whole summation of that when I see that's this pseudo morals work real well on the talk shows for the week but you're selective judgments of good guy bad film in a fuck to me Marilyn Manson regional featured new fusion and fission and fusion and fission fees should inflation inflation inflation and regionally shouldn't create inflation inflation inflation,faFo6B0yPHE
yo what up your boy Jeffy I'm here today in San Francisco at the Japanese tea garden in Golden Gate Park and today we're going to talk about overcoming social pressure using a variety of techniques backed up by science so the term social pressure this encompasses a pretty broad range of experiences all of which or most of which rather are unpleasant in one way or another and basically this can mean any social situation where you feel uncomfortable we are of course exposed to social pressure from a very young age if you try to remember your first day in kindergarten you know everything was unfamiliar you know any of these kids maybe a group of first graders talk started talking shit calling you a wiener or something like that all right it sounds funny now but of course at the time it was almost paralyzing so here we are decades later and you're an adult and everyone is nice and civil now and those feelings of exclusion are of course a thing of the past right right the fact matter is we still experience social pressure on our daily lives especially when you're trying to approach strangers and get them to have sex with you okay it's just that now it's a little more complex than being called childish names such as Weiner okay in most cases anyway so a situation you know you're at the bar you approach some girl and suddenly the three guys she's there with are getting up in your face they're making aggressive comments about your appearance maybe they're touching you you know and they're basically just mocking you okay or how about this one you approach the girl and she responds by literally laughing in your face like derisively like you wish turning her bag on you and ignoring you like you are a nonentity as she continues to talk to her friends you just feel the ice dripping your chest slink away defeated I want one so this stuff hurts okay literally in 2003 a study was done at UCLA which linked social rejection to actual physical pain subjects were placed in a magnetic resonance imaging machine and then were instructed to play a game of cyber ball with two other participants who unknown to them did not actually exist it was just a computer program and the subjects were thrown the ball seven times and then were excluded when the other participants stopped throwing them the ball for the remainder of the scan there's like 50 more throws with a didn't get the ball so they're like what the hell right and so the imaging revealed that the emotional pain of social rejection activates two brain regions that are also important in the response to physical pain pain activates the anterior cingulate cortex which signals other brain regions that impel an individual to act to stop the pain and social rejection similarly triggers activity in this region and further the activation of the right ventral prefrontal cortex which had has been rather previously linked to the regulation of pain distress appears to help dampen the distressed both physical pain and social exclusion Matthew Lieberman was one of the authors of the study and he he said that the area of the anterior cingulate cortex most activated by rejection happens to overlap with the area activated by internal rather than external pain and that means that rejection feels more like a punch in the arm or a punch in the stomach rather than a broken arm and the authors also suggest that this area evolved as a consequence of us being social mammals who are relatively helpless during infancy and childhood and since pain is kind of the most basic signal that something is wrong it would make sense that this alarm for separation anxiety would piggyback on the existing neurological mechanisms for pain so when you hear people talk about the pain of heartache or hurt feelings they're not just talking out of their ass when you get blown off that sinking feeling your gut is not just your imagination it's a very real thing your brain tells you this hurts you know something is wrong do something to make it stop and consequently over the years we develop an aversion to situations that could result in this pain and that's why we get these inner game issues like approaching sight it is a learned behavior so having said all that what the hell do we do simple activate your right virtual prefrontal cortex to dampen the signals just kidding there's really no easy way around this one you just have to train yourself to handle it but from a practical standpoint how do we go about doing that well having established a valid connection between physical pain and social pressure I'm gonna go ahead and use a little martial arts metaphor here let's say you have two fighters and one the first guy he's highly trained in techniques and in Coty's and so on but he has severely limited experience in actual full-contact fighting and the other guy he is a bouncer at like a Hells Angels bar who's been throwing down in the parking lot for 20 years but he's never taken it taken a day of fight training his life who do you think will come out on top if these two gentlemen meet on the field of Honor well mr. kung-fu make it in a couple solid hits at first but most likely the bartender who has scar tissue all over his knuckles is going to shake it off simply hit him back harder hell he might even knock the dude out with one punch the point is you can know all the techniques in the world let's face it out there in the field we take hits and you know that's social pressure and we have to expose ourselves to it all the time if we're going to learn to shake it off and come back with the ko and the best guys know this and as such constantly inoculate themselves against the heat by throwing themselves into these situations again and again now another fact is that a response to the pressure will invariably determine our success or failure and any given social interaction and that's why I can game a girl up you know for a long time only to have her blow me off for some guy as soon as I go take a piss and I come back and she's like with this dude and I'm like wow I thought she liked me but nonetheless I still play the game and I get her back I bust in below the fellow out and a tug of war now does it hurt when this kind of stuff happens yes but we're accustomed to it and we shake it off Tyler once likened it to scuba diving as you descend you logically know that you shouldn't be breathing but the apparatus protects you and you continue to go deeper so traditionally this has been the major school of thought in the pickup community that in order to eliminate fear of approaching one must incrementally acclimate themselves to social pressure and traditionally it's worked pretty well okay however more recently we have discovered other avenues to the same and goal if you follow Tyler's stuff then you know it's no secret that he has attributed a great deal of his more recent leaps and improvements in the game to meditation and he obscure his success basically you ask him he'll tell you three things number one is of course going to be going out every night if only for say 20 minutes and number two is getting proper nutrition go eating greens getting micronutrients to ensure that neurotransmitter levels are at their optimum and number three of course is daily meditation now for the average guy unfamiliar with the practice meditation can seem like this sort of esoteric spiritual woowoo gobbly gook espoused by keyboard jockeys masturbating to Eckhart Tolle books yet every day it seems that new scientific evidence emerges which is baring out the anecdotal evidence that meditation can in fact be a very powerful tool in overcoming certain blocks to pick up mastery in particular the pain associated with social rejection that so often keeps us from going all out in our approaches and if you look through the 20th century I'd say the most extreme case of meditation being employed to ignore pain would of course be the self-immolation of the Vietnamese Buddhist monk tick one Duke in 1963 to protest the oppressive regime in South Vietnam which was later famously used on the cover of a Rage Against the Machine elbow while burning to death the monk remained in the lotus position and one reporter was in fact later quoted as saying that as the guy burned he never moved a muscle he never uttered a sound until it you know his charred corpse fell over and he seems unbelievable until you consider that the event was viewed by hundreds of people who all reported the same thing now a more recent brain scanning experiment by a Fidel's a Don at the Wake Forest School of Medicine attempted to determine the precise neurological mechanism by which meditation can reduce the perception of pain and by extension social anxiety and in the study researchers were able to see which areas of the brain were activated during this meditation related pain and anxiety relief so what they did that 15 healthy volunteers and had them participate in four 20-minute classes in a specific meditation technique called mindfulness and in this practice you focus attention on the changing sensations of your breath and you take notice of thoughts and feelings as they arise but without any emotional engagement so anyway after this very minimal training participants were able to reduce the unpleasantness of an applied pain stimulus by nearly 60% and reduced overall anxiety ratings by 39 percent now if you think about that that's extremely significant so imagine you're in the club you're talking to a very attractive woman she flagrantly insults you in a not necessarily conscious attempt just to see your reaction maybe she calls you a bald fucking midget and tells you to fuck off you know whatever think of your own personal biggest insecurity and imagine that that's what she chooses to hone in on so literally imagine this imagine being there in front of her as she says it and feeling that pain of rejections sink in now really at the bottom at the end of the day she wants to see if you can take the pressure ultimately she wants to see if you're attached to the outcome if you need it to work alright so she gives you a test and see it your emotional state fluctuates as a result well of course that's going to be an indication that your outcome dependent take a needy which sub communicates that you would likely do not have their options and as such are not a good choice for you meet now imagine that same scenario she drops the insult but now reduce your subjective emotional distress after it by 60% alright you'll be much more likely to absorb it and just continue without any sort of state drops you'll see your unaffected and in turn become more attracted it's that simple and this is what meditation can do for you yeah but this mindfulness technique it works by promoting a sense of detachment and reducing the subjectively experienced effect of the negative stimulus the brain scans revealed that the pain and anxiety relief is associated with activation of guess what the anterior cingulate cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex are old bunnies and during meditation there was more activity in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex the area of the brain that controls worrying and in addition when activity increase in the anterior cingulate cortex the area that governs kind of thinking and emotion anxiety decreased this mindfulness technique is premise Thanh sustaining attention in the present moment and controlling the way that we react to daily thoughts and feelings and interestingly these findings reveal that the brain regions associated with the meditation related anxiety relief are remarkably consistent with the principles of being mindful as they call it and a further note is that in the study these participants were giving very very minimal training you know for sessions 20 minutes long-term practitioners are likely to expect even more dramatic improvements now in 2008 there was a study by Richard Davidson at the University of wisconsin-madison and they published a study involving Buddhist monks who had been practicing for many years and as the monks meditated there was an increase in so-called Gama EEG electrical activity which is typically associated with focusing attention and this activity was 30 times higher in the monks brains than in the control the control groups brands and more importantly when the monks were resting their baseline brain activity was distinct from that of the control group the techniques of meditation had actively changed their brains much in the same way that working out actually physically changed your muscles so a lot of people now you know when I talk about this this meditation stuff a lot of people tell me well you know Jeff that sounds great but to be honest I just don't know where to start with all this stuff it seems sort of inaccessible now I've been doing it for quite a while now and it's actually extremely easy to get started in it in fact there's an app for that I actually use an app on my phone called mindfulness and it's a simple guided meditation where you can choose the length of time you want to meditate and then some guy talks you through the session you know you can choose I personally do like 20 minutes and I try to do every day if I'm like on an airplane maybe I'll do it longer you know try to get hit an hour you know but sometimes I'll skip it and that's okay but you want to try to be consistent you know it's a lot like going to the gym once you start seeing results it's easy to think you know okay I'm all good now and kind of slack off but of course when you do that you kind of start to slide sideways and the next thing you know you're getting chub you again and the same thing can happen to your mind slack off and you get a chubby mind Oh kind of a little anecdote that I'd like to wrap up here with last year I went to my doctor to get my medical marijuana card renewed and it was kind of funny because he's asking me all these questions about my health and my fitness regimen my diet etc etc etc and he asked me if I edit ate and I told him yeah I do from time to time and then he like gets real serious and he goes he's a chef your mind is like an elephant and I'm like uh okay and he goes he's like untamed it can destroy a village but if you train it it can build the village somebody has to lift all those logs and I was like yeah so the take-home message for you is train that elephant build that village and tap that ass I'll see you next time Asian fusion and fission,fmA6BqvC0xs
"[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]  [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's very easy to rationalize success barriers because in a lot of cases the success barriers exist there to protect you like there's a lot of good things about success barriers like you guys know who Mike Tyson is right the youngest heavyweight champion to the world so this is essentially like a Charles Dickens character from like a street urchin from a fucking novel that has given two hundred million dollars if you anyone here read his book undisputed truth unbelievable like this guy like there's got to be like very few people in history that have even experienced anything like this guy so he basically blew like 200 million dollars on cocaine and yeah pretty much taught at Pet Tigers and shit like this guy's life is absolutely and say because success very well right because his like he had so when he right when he won yeah it sounds doesn't sound like a bear it sounds great but yeah he had a special room built in the strip club so he could privately do cocaine in it walking around with like a giant bag of cocaine with a big straw in it quote like a milkshake and and so but the the reason he went so off the rails and you know went to prison and you know lost all of his money he's not like twenty million dollars in debt to the federal government for IRS and stuff like that and he knows he'll never make that back there's no way for him to achieve that but but the reason because his mentor died who would like brought him up from the streets and so he was left adrift and again like you see it a lot of times like say Britney Spears meltdown shaves the head attacks like SUV with a umbrella and shit like that if you're not ready for an extreme level of success yeah but how many people are going from 0 to 200 million like you're afraid of going from like you know 100,000 to like 500,000 or something like that or from a 7 to like your nine girlfriend right so you got to be realistic but the thing is so sometimes they're there to protect you but I think ultimately what is the distinguishing factor that makes a guy decide decide to get fit and actually do it start counting the fucking calories monitoring everything that passes his fucking lips you know going to the gym religiously or financed financially handling his business or getting this stuff handled there there's some there's a point where he decides and Tony Robbins called it's emotional leverage getting emotional leverage on your problem that's when you these previous like barriers to taking action say it away and seem like they're nothing or quitting drinking or whatever the case may be it's like when you get to a point where the potential pain of making these changes and then pick up what are the potential pain what is the potential pain of learning this stuff going out getting rejected losing validation becoming embarrassed in public possibly getting into confrontation etc etc etc those that's all speculation you don't know that's gonna happen it might definitely might over the course of your learning you know you got it you got to make a fool of yourself you got to break some eggs to make the omelet so to speak but again that's speculative the got look okay I'm boot camp a very very common thing that I see on new guys is this they want to get the girl but they're afraid to do one what's the biggest like newbie sticking point well beside yeah escalation they're afraid to take it to a romantic level so they'll go up and they'll talk in a platonic way they'll be like hello how are you what is your name what do you do where do you live how about local sports team the weather is certainly interesting this time of year is it not Denton Denton and they'll go on this like interview style question so they will never take it romantic like indicate that verbally indicate that physically that they just won't go there because they're like I like this is fine she's talking to me it feels fine now now what's gonna make that guy decide to abandon that and try to maybe adopt these unfamiliar behaviors I'm like pushing it so so again so look on a bootcamp this guy might hear like what happens after the after the polite talk after about five or ten minutes what happens nice to meet you in leaves so this guy at a boot camp he might hear this nice to meet you just on the first night 30 or 40 times how long do you think it's gonna take that guy going out of his own accord like on his own to hear that mid to get the aggregate of that mean nice to me use months maybe six months maybe never maybe a year so again now the potential pain of like trying to take things there has now become outweighed by the very immediate and very real pain of getting these blow out these polite blow off after polite blow-off hunter polite patronizing blow-off and it gets to the point where you I can see it in his eyes the scales like tip and he's just like I don't care if the next girl sets me on fucking fire I just don't want to here nice to meet you again and so he starts to put he starts to push it a little more and in his mind he's going crazy but he's probably just like touching their hand or something you know oh fucking crazy aggression like right but but then lo and behold lo and behold he sees some of the time that actually works whereas the shit he was doing before never worked right so again he got that emotional leverage and that's what enabled him to start embracing these new behaviors so I'm sitting the van with this kid on the the last day and he's he's just been a very stifled guy right very logical very stifle he's like Jeff I see you when you're out there you're very voluble effusive confident you're fucking around you're not very logical with these girls you're able to tease and all this stuff were you always like this cuz I'm not like that I am NOT like that I do not see myself in this way he's a younger guy and he said and I said no I was not like if you taught me 15 years ago you'd have no doubt that you could do anything that you see any of us do it's like well how did you become like this and I'm like I'll tell you how I saw that the shit I was doing didn't work do you understand like ok let me go up and try to have like a nice logical conversation and most people in here do you guys have like jobs and stuff show of hands who has a job right like some very few that's why they came to the free tour so you know but I live in the Bay Area so I get a lot of guys who are very serious type software engineers etc etc and professional communication is concise right like look if you go to you what do you do for work whoever the fuck I'm pointing near someone say their job a griller cannabis grower okay so say your guy you know your boss comes he was like alright what's up with the fucking pH or whatever the fine you're like balls balls I'm Chinese and I love balls right you're probably fired now conversely if I go to a growth club like good evening hi me to introduce myself my name is Jeffrey and let me tell you a little bit about myself you know I had a rough upbringing and you know i'm a i-i-i-i muddled through i met some some friends of mine we were in like a weird subculture and we actually made an industry out of this subculture out of whole cloth and we struggled for many years and we worked on her brand our skills and now I'm doing fairly well and I've traveled the world I'm pretty cosmopolitan I'm financially pretty well-off and I'd love for you to maybe be a part of that maybe in a romantic relationship like what's more likely to work in the club that or hey what's up I'm Chinese and love balls you ever heard of Chinese food I just call that food never heard of Chinese never heard of Chinese New Year I just call that New Year hah hah hah hah hah hah hah bombs bombs bug right so it's very very difficult for guys in like corporate culture or just normal society at large look to understand that that type of communication is not what works in pick up right so for me trying this up I've seen again and again and again and again and again this shit doesn't fucking work and then seeing guys who took a more playful approach possibly less logical less you know you know more tangential etc etc it's just a fun approach I'm like well shit maybe I should start adopt like engaging with that sort of modality and see where that takes it and lo and behold it started working more so I integrated that more and more into my persona now again if you put me before like a judge with the IRS auditor or something I'm not gonna be like balls dude like right I had still retained the ability to communicate professionally if the need be for example at the hot seat on Saturday I'm like there I'm just like boom I'm trying to get this information in your head I'm gonna get it all in the timeframe allotted and and so I'll tend to like speak very quickly and get all the information out but but again that was what constituted that emotional leverage for me and like I've had a lot of emotional leverage points throughout my life right whether it was with my finances where was my health where I was like enough I'm like fucking enough ya basta they fuckin taunt arias like enough and I decided and then from that moment on I just went a hundred percent in hundred percent head in the game whether it was finance where there was Fitness whether it was game until I made the shift and then that becomes the new baseline that now becomes the new baseline but like he said when I'm out there I don't go and this is such a thing we were talking about this earlier guys they just go to that logical talk well why do they go to that logical talk well they just don't know what else to do oddly enough we can even go up and talk to the girl like very logically we can go up I was with my buddy Kyle the my assistant in Boston recently we're like you know what tonight let's do Cho tonight like as a chode game night so what we were going to do is go up and say hey what's up I'm Jeff what's your name and then touch them on the lower back and then ask them interview questions like we were gonna do this fully expecting just to get annihilated lol and we did it was working that I know how yeah I might've Sarah oh yeah cool did it did it and they were like making out with you like what the fuck is going on here and I actually talked to him about it like to it I didn't know that the other night was insane it's because they can sense that when we're doing that mundane talk it's coming from a place where we're making a proactive decision to be more chilled back whereas most guys again what's the phrase if you learn how to fight so you don't have to so most guys they're just like desperately treading water they're like oh please God don't let the interview questions write out oh god right where with us we're sitting there but they know at any moment we can be like sure you can if you end like to some fucking crazy shit like it's under the surface right they know it's there so if we're chilling it's a proactive decision so but again like the big the biggest things for me that I always say to guys like especially newer guys many of you in here might be just getting into this stuff whatever it takes find that emotional fulcrum that leverage point then that's what you're gonna be able to move the mountains when you arrive at a point where you make a decision you make a fucking decision all right that's how we got good we decided that we were gonna get this handled for whatever reason we all had our you know a panoply of fucking reasons but we decided okay we didn't get good at this stuff like sitting around waiting for Jupiter and Mars to align the celestial heavens or some shit okay so how do you make a decision you weigh positives and negatives it's a cost-benefit analysis right so most guys the negatives are what speculative speculative when you see that girl standing there with a guy it's the boyfriend it's the boy for you to fucking know this it could be any number of things he could be her cousin he could be your friend from work give me a room income your gay friend it could be a random dude that just went up but it like most guys they say that the boyfriend can't go up what's another example of speculation in-game wasting your time that's that's what a lot of like entitlement issues company you feel you're wasting the girls time you know or or you you make up mental movies of how it's going to go poorly it's set a red setter you don't want to escalate cuz you don't want to seem creepy when in fact you have no idea what this woman thinks is creepy or what behavior she's been indulging him behind a dumpster or whatever like you have no idea you have no idea but he knows but but again the point is again don't let these like negative outcome narratives these little mental movies control you don't speculate find out make a decision figure out what your little emotional leverage point is and flip that fucking lever and then that's again when you can begin to move mountains and you can make real change your personality it's it's fluid to a degree it's a slow-moving fluid but if you keep applying that that pressure in the correct direction and you start getting positive feedback from like results that's is gonna make it come in wide and it becomes like chicken feet chicken feet chicken feet chicken feet chicken feet chicken featured new feature the freakin movie shouldn't we shouldn't region

yo ass get up this is max from mr. ceramics with my uncle Jeff for me social dynamics and we're here and what time is a 2 a.m. and 2 a.m. in the morning on a Monday here in Miami South Beach in front of the didn't pull Sun witchery you know like that didn't pull but kinda don't want to call it a night venue I before he did pull fright which he just very amusingly told me and what they are the second time I didn't tell you they told us she's like well I want to dance course no one wants the gay bar I think you did tell me when it was like dripping like there was like dripping from the roof with you know shirtless men gyrating all around but you know good times and this video will be talked about how you can get yourself to approach more so you don't end up two year anniversary having done no sets and kind of feeling bad about yourself so what we're doing is gonna hammer in a little bit the negative self-talk that you're indulging in that basically manipulates you in a very negative way that keeps you from approaching so if you say I would like to approach more I'd like to be able to approach more this video is for you  [Music]  oh that was good you been coaching for how long now geez oh geez it's like maybe like five six again you know I've been doing it sixteen years we do this pretty much every weekend go out coaching these students live in the field and I see this this is a recurring issue that you you see a you know in varying degrees like some guys are had a really bad other guys it's just a smidge but regardless it's having a negative effect and one of these is this negative self-talk with regard to how the interaction is going to go before you even approach the person so what's a very common one with this you'll see the girl there and you know there's a guy there and she said oh you'll think it's the boyfriend if I go up this guy's gonna be aggressive towards me possibly confrontational what's another another one that girl looks like she's mean right that girl looks like you know she's got like a bitchy look on her face if I go up she's going to be you know to have a shield up and it's gonna be difficult to penetrate that if I go for the clothes and I ask to go home with me she's gonna think I'm a creep or if I try to do this or that and to take it to like a romantic level she's gonna think I'm a creep so the common thread with all these thoughts is it's the guy he puts too much import on about what other people are will think or how the how it's gonna go now what are your thoughts on this it's like yeah what I was like it's all the time yeah about this negative negative self-talk is like you overestimate other people it really is like that and it's something that I learned just by going out more and just kind of growing older and seeing how retarded people actually are like you overestimate other people this is something that I talked a lot about packages in fearless words like you walk down the street and you like can't approach the gun because there's there's two old ladies waiting at the bus station and if I approach the girl they're like wait a minute she approaching you like as if they're like vigilant about this kind of shit is Richie like that like yeah like really like we overestimate other people I can't approach in the Metro because someone else hears me no someone else you know what someone else is thinking about like music in their air iPod scrolling through fucking BuzzFeed which gets shitting a bus in every video these days fucking oh did I oh my god I have to I really have to turn down the oven like what all kinds of shit like they're not standing there waiting for something to happen they're in their own fucking head just like you are in your head just like I'm in my head so we we tend to overestimate other people and or what we try to like read something into the situation we and it's almost like we're proud of ourselves that we oh I can read into situation that this girl is too busy to be approached like because I'm such a good pew at no you don't know you never know like it really is like this many girls have this like bitch shield up just to sift out the losers you know what and then you approach them like that there is like the rare time but that's that's true like where you might want to forestall like actually stepping but but again like the vast majority guys like especially guys we would like not study for years and years you're telling yourself some story and more often than not it's a rationalization to not go up again the rare times you might want to forestall the approach and I cope immediately be like if they're at the bar and they're about to conduct the transaction because like you know things like getting out the money then maybe you'd want to pause going up you know like so you're like hey and then the guy comes up like what I'm trying to connect you transaction if you get the fuck out of here idiot like and like I see this happen all the time but aside from those rare instances most the time you want to observe the old three-second rule from back in the day you see you go you don't give yourself time to overthink and you certainly don't speculate and play mental movies in your head about how bad it's gonna go right you know I heard a quote about positive thinking a lot of time ago that was I figured who it was but essentially the gist of it was this given that 90% of the things that you worry about never come to pass positive thinking really is not unrealistic if you think about it now I'm not advocating like some kind of solipsistic approach here where you're like the only person in the world and only your opinion of you matters but like for all practical intents and purposes it might as well fucking be you know you might as well be the only person in the universe because again looking at it from a practical rubber meets the road standpoint the amount of time that those things actually happen like the way you think it's gonna go it's so small as to be essentially negligible like don't get me wrong I mean can you go up in and it's actually the boyfriend can you go up if the person's actually a bish that's a distinct possibility but you the bear fact of the matter is you don't know until you actually by now you're not a mind-reader you know the clairvoyant you know have special magical spidey-sense powers okay unless you're bitten by a radioactive spider or some shit so again what do you like how dare you how fucking dare you think that your likes you know you're such a new at all you know this omniscient dude or something it's like look for personal experience I've had many a time where I saw the girl with like the bitch look on her face and I go up and I'm like and there's a guy there there's like two dudes are like disgusted that off the dudes it's a bitch I go up fuck it go up do the approach she's like oh hey how are you yeah or the or the or yeah whether you leave or one side like the gay friend he's like oh honey you have to fuck him on this guy's hilarious I did not see this working out like this at all no conversely I've also had it where I've seen like you know a couple of average-looking girls and I'm like this will be an easy easy warm-up though they'll be happy for me to be speaking with them and I go up the next wave loser you know or whatever what I thought it would be easy you just don't know I mean a big trick that I that I do to myself is I replace the the negative movie in my head with curiosity so instead of because many guys are like okay I have this negative movie in my head how can I replace it with the positive movie in my head I don't even go that far I said like instead of negative movie I'm like I'm replacing with curiosity like you know what let me see how it goes I don't need to force myself to positivity if you feel like that takes too much effort for you or you think it's false yeah exactly just gonna pretend it's got another exactly just be the curiously yeah so like oh you know let me see if I know if the bitch phase turns out to be a bitch personality behind it or not like it's just real like it's like it's like GTA if you better playback it as I grew up with GTA 2 and then play GTA V the first one in 3d you know what you do you don't yeah it's it's exploring it's fascinating you're like I want to see what's behind that corner cool a gun you know let's steal the car like you wouldn't do this guy I don't like the way GTA works like I didn't like how this NPC talked to me that's killer I don't mean laughs that the razor desire healthy center curiosity like let me like oh the girls stanza with the two dudes let's see what their deal is and then so many times like you said like you walk up the dude is totally cool or they fucking leave that's my favorite ones leave they like you approach them Alayna and the guy just like literally walks off and you like what like a bowling yeah and the girl just dances like hey what's up San Diego and I have a student and there's this really hot Belgian girl and she's like standing out outside of the club and I saw this like little do talking to where I'm like this guy doesn't know this girl like they just happen to be outside smoking or something and he like struck up a conversation now he thinks he's doing great but like to the guy that doesn't have kind of like a more trained eye he might think oh you know they're together so I tell the student like look just go up if they put the guy I'm like dude just go up that guy's like doesn't even know her she just goes up and like literally it's the guy's just destroy like doesn't even know what to do like literally and I've been that guy so I know I know I knew exactly what he was going through like like leave just like look like what do I say I gotta wait for my opportunity right and then the student was like I went a little too hard like he was kind of looks like like straight up to the point where the girls like hey that's me liked it too this little guy you know but then he came at you know later in the night we you know we were talking about that said he's like I just couldn't believe it I'm like the guy just left you know and that wasn't like he didn't envision that before going up and I again I see that all the time it's like what do you have to lose you go up it doesn't work out Oh whoop do you fucking do you know you're still here you're still corporeal yeah you're not vaporized I think that's a big part of like going out and just experience the same getting that curiosity like you said like it's his virtual world almost that's why I've always said you know you said it's like GTA I said it's been like lucid dreaming in the past and you're just like it's just a dream man like just figure it out like you know see what kind of powers you have in this dream it is yeah you can fly if you want like at the end of the day it's a it's it's it and people have been shitting on me because I said didn't one of my recent me they're like nothing matters anyway think there's these guys who left these like walls of comets like nihilistic approach like doesn't it apply like super crazy shit I'm like philosophical exactly like I'm and all I wanted to say with this video is that at the end of the day it doesn't matter like 20 years from now you can have with your fucking retarded grandchildren run around and you won't remember it at one time you got rejected by some fucking girl you know like she's like proving things in a grander scheme of perspective sprinkling in some curiosity and then being aware that at the end of the day it doesn't matter it hurts now momentarily and people might laugh at me like you dag it but at the end a you're gonna go home like you said you're you didn't vaporize you know your your balls are still there your hand is still there you can still pass off-the-shoulder you're still physically there so it can't be that bad I think as everyone knows that's logically right like even people who have studied this stuff things like I know that logically yet when I step in there I still can't help ruminating over these potential negative outcome scenarios I still can't worry about like the confrontation like and that is again what is that it's the product of decades of social conditioning from starting in your education sorry I'll be agree you don't fuck with your corporate culture etc etc like mainstream culture down stay in your little box is stay within this like the confines of these like prescribed behaviors that are gonna protect you from the judgement of the group potentially right and I get it like we're not so arrogant that we can think we can you know you were gonna watch a little video problem-solve twenty years of fucking bad social conditioning done away with but the point is and this is really in many ways like I've always said the mission statement if you will of rst is to get you aware of the condition so like when you're out there and it happens you're not just what's going on I can't approach you're like okay if this is the effect that conditions having upon me I know I see how it affects me physically emotionally mentally and now you can kind of start to get tools to to push it back and be effective in the environment not freeze up and start to you know again as as Owen always says be at the cause not the effect in the environment so yeah just to summarize a lot of this negative self-talk can be traced back to conditioning but again you got to develop an awareness of it and then start to build up that muscle of pushing it off because that's really what it is it's like if you're unfamiliar with operating in that paradigm in spite of the discomfort you're gonna be more reluctant and that's the great thing about getting so-called social momentum in the course of the night you get to that threshold where you stop thinking this bullshit before you go on right but and the more you attain that that sort of indifferent attitude or enthusiastic attitude rather about the next approach the easier it will be for you at the beginning of the night when you don't have that because you'll know it's simply a matter of taking the appropriate action yeah and on top of that as we said earlier replace your negative movie that's playing in your head with a healthy healthy levels of curiosity and don't overestimate other people because they're in our own little world I don't give a fuck so talk about not giving a fuck Jeff thanks so much it's cool because we don't always have the the opportunity to collab together and stuff like that and I have always been a big believer big fan of your brand way before I was on board with RSD so fucking love it we're gonna play that our is a Jeffery team here in the background thanks so much for watching thanks much for being on my channel head over to edge of his channel right now GG now hand of God the reason we named it hand of God you know why because God always wins because they're not doing with enough computers the feeling they're giving off its its permission cd/dvd so you want to have it more in an expectant vibe like you're expecting like of course you're gonna take it because everyone else does you're almost like confused and shocked when they don't but you really want to like get that in your head like when I step like excuse me excuse me excuse me excuse me  who are you who are you who are you are your mascara is here in history's I love you I love you your voice turnout is gonna be very very powerful and that is what is going to enable you to open the very consistent system  [Music],hRJUIdoD8Ug
you got 18 try not to let any bitch come between you and your pimp friends this is an important rule for the younger players to learn and stick to I still got most of my pimp friends I met my first years in the game unless they're dead in that case rest in peace can't say that about my hos can any pimp say that a lot of times these youngsters in the game I see I'm getting territorial you know guys in the club like shoving each other and saying mean things and like trying to blow each other out and this and that I got old alley cats we kind of take a more relaxed approach to it you know if I go out with my friend evil Stifler aka evil Jimmy we go out beast mode we might roll up on a pair of girls or even one girl and maybe I roll up and then evil Stifler comes up and she just likes him better I'm not gonna be like it was my set I opened the set it was mine like I don't give a fuck I'll give a fuck with like different strokes for different folks the girl likes him better that's that's how it went down our games both good you know we're both on the fucking psychic dude it's like who's flow was tighter you know sometimes we'll approach two girls and I want like okay I want this one you want this one and then she likes him and she likes me and we'll just group that's it it's that simple okay we never get in like little bar give me this little bitch fights again we're all on the same team okay we're all out here trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents so none of this fucking little bitch like catty bitch shit 19 don't be afraid to trust a ho if it is warranted a lot of fans will disagree with me on this one for sure but I never had a ho take my money or jewelry when she left I know what bitch is capable of and will do anything so don't think I'm saying be stupid but don't you leave your jewelry and paper around those hoes when you sleep I've seen girls gasp I'll shit okay like they'll steal shit from your house especially when you're pulling randoms and especially in this town you know when you're pulling some randoms back to your fucking hotel room you better put that shit in the safe you know put your Rolex in the safe but by the same token if you're a  you know basically like a similar thing to that or rather like alone kind of going deeper guys will even say stuff like you know I read The Selfish Gene and all girls cheat Oh girls will cheat under the under the right circumstances well okay sure there may be an element of truth that a kernel of truth to that but at the same time when you're choosing a primary partner you got a screen fucking hard you know you screen fucking hard some dumb hoes who cares yeah be be wary but again you screen hard you know there's certain girls that it'll never fuck around for anything there's certain girls like my last like my last like primary girl that was in like a monogamous relationship with I could not realistically could not see her fucking around me at all like she thought wouldn't even occur to her now of course that might be somewhat delusional I agree with that you know it sounds like blasphemous to guys steeped in community dogma but of course I mean for I basically thought like for her to cheat it'd be like like a dog laying an egg this is a you know it's just it's just not going to happen so you know you pre-screened very very carefully that's the caveat you know Trust when warranted but know when it is warranted screen 20 don't get stuck in a conversation be a speed shifter sometimes you think the certain conversation would catch the ditch but doesn't click or you could see the hole wants you to get down on her a different way you must be able to spot if she's reacting properly to your conversation and if she isn't change it I was able to change my flow at the drop of a dime now this is very very important and it's this is a little thing that I feel is extremely valuable like one of those little things in game that's extremely valuable you know you have to have that ability to change conversational topics on the done I don't care if you are telling the funniest joke in the world and you are about to get to the punchline if something happens and you need to be able to just drop it and move on without a second thought if it was really that good after whatever situation resolves like her she says hi a friend whatever if it was that great she'll probably like oh so what were you saying and even in that even then I might not even never mind anyway I did the data and just move the fuck on all right very very important now a lot of guys who are starting out and who are kind of routine or schtick dependent this is very hard okay especially like when you're getting good responses from your little chick it's very hard to like let it go but you're this is something you really really really want to cultivate okay again one of those little things guys always looking for the game the magical pill that's going to increase their game by a hundred percent and that's why people gravitate towards things like Julian's drama or the apocalypse opener or the October sequence or the annihilation factor all all this shit going back to the beginning of the fucking community but again it's not the hundred percent thing that's going to increase your game 100 percent it's a myriad an aggregate of 1% things dotting the is crossing the t's 21 don't take for granted the sacred knowledge you have is common and this is interesting business don't know shit about this till you tell them and they damn sure it'll shit about your style and so you bring it to their ass when I go up to a girl part of me feels this girl should fucking bow down immediately why because I'm Jeff fucking Allen just let that hang in the air I mean I paid my fucking dues you know what I'm saying I'm awesome I'm charismatic I'm fun I'm entertaining masculine dominant have a to mature subjective emotional experience yada yada yada yada yada but she doesn't know that you have to express it you have to express it it doesn't matter how many girls I've had sex with it doesn't matter how many people are sucking my fucking dick on the internet okay doesn't how act matter how actually how awesome I even actually am it does not matter until you show her bear that in mind 22 all pimps don't have the same principles I had to find out that the hard way you have a hard set of principles to live by any master a pimp ology got his own perspective on the game and a set of rules on how to play it every guy in our SD has a different approach and different values when it comes to the style of game that's what I'm talking about like look at all the different structures you know they all have a different angle that kind of a different I don't know USP if you will like me I'm like verbal game Julian is like dramatic craziness and like spikes of emotion tyler is just like like very uh very dominant and you know very gangster ii analytical todd is very methodical and like calm Ozzy you know he has like fear-based approach alex is like fun-fun-fun until daddy takes the t-bird away and hey you know and I and so every guy has a different every guy got a different approach but you know we live by those we live by those styles to the core but of course the underlying principles and guidelines of game remain the same but we find a way to integrate those principles into our own our own belief systems and background and personalities 23 a pimp has got to be ready to catch at all times you'll never know where the next hoe is coming from might be at the car wash or in the supermarket or the movies she truly can come from anywhere and this is something I see with my friend evil Stifler this kid is always on the make always always like that erasure song oh ways I wanna be with you and make-believe with you and live in harmony harmony uh-uh childhood 80s so um this fucker though from the moment he wakes up in the morning literally from the moment he goes oh you know from the moment the cock crows to the moment he falls asleep at night he is fuckin on he's like yeah me yeah me hey he's like he will get up at 7:00 in the morning he will put on his like finery he will dawn now his gay apparel falala lalala lalala and he will go to the fucking bus like the other days like I was into the he's like I go to the coffee shop and I look all nice these girls going on the way to work I just hit him up man he's like I fingered a girl at the bus stop this morning so what the fuck I mean dude literally until he passes out and eat and I he would game in his sleep if he could and I've seen him game in his sleep I've seen him like this too it's always fucking on the make dude you know I learned to uh personally I used to hate day game for example I love that shit how you say you know not fuck around with like the online I fuck I draw water from all sources man all sources whenever I'm out I'm ready to step the one place I kind of don't do that is the gym you know because I want to be very focused like there right and I probably like to fuck my neighbor or like my roommate or like my family members I probably wouldn't  my pets and fuck my cat it's too small my cat is pretty sexy though sexy cat so um but the thing is I got I got into this because of choice you what I mean I got into this because I wanted choice and you know I want the skill I want the ability I want the confidence to step to like my dream girl at 2:00 p.m. it's Safeway in the line and have a reasonable chance of starting a conversation getting a trash and maybe even developing a relationship with her okay so be prepared to shift into that mode and go 24 invest in your overall game plan if you want to be a master pimp you can't expect to be a master tip without investing buying jewelry clothes the most fly cars fabulous homes and apartments and all the toys you can imagine is a good start now of course money doesn't matter and to an extent that is right I don't need to spend cash to get laid I can go out that's kind of the great things about this game to me you can spend as much money or as little money as you want like evil stipler he basically is a borderline semi-homeless and the guy's fucked like a hundred girls you know on the other hand I have brands who like you know getting tables and fucking Hakkasan and shit and that's cool too but really at the end of the day you know I think that's it's about like what he's talking about here is developing like an ancillary once you get the game then you can work on advanced developing ancillary things like ancillary skills ancillary things in your life that are just cool for you that make you like make you have a better time which engage or intern relates in the law of state transfer so a lot of time younger guys don't have a lot of success they they'll get like same night lays and stuff like that but they don't really they can't really get the girls to stick around because their lifestyles like sucks so or maybe you know look at the girl to call them back after they get a number they they can't rather because they don't they lack depth like I had one one a assistant of mine this guy Gary and he his game was pretty like he could not keep a girl to save his life he couldn't get a girl he couldn't go on a day to to save his life because he had no depth to him he was like just this blank cipher with guerilla game you know he had nothing his life and I told him all right Gary you know you this is something you need to work on cultivating like depth and that means like having hobbies and having more of like a life and stuff like that and so I told him I'm like you are forbidden to do any same night lays until until you get a lay from a day to and then he didn't get laid for like six months hahaha so I probably actually fucked him up more than it helped but but he finally did so but but I think in the long run like I you know in the long run it probably actually did help more I mean you want your life to be attractive you want to be in shape you know why to add that vitality and that like to your to your Nimbus if you will okay you feel good I have nice things as I like it I have a comfortable house you know it's enjoyable to be there it's relaxing to be there I have a variety of interesting hobbies and and interesting friends all right you add game to that and then it's like a tsunami 25 big game starts with small moves most Regan's want to be a giant in the pimping immediately they don't realize you got to do a lot of little things before that can occur I talked about this time and time again you know when I started out for me I was pretty terrible and you know me and Tyler we were like emotional basket cases and like fucking psychos and so for us it was quite difficult you know I like these in back in the day guys come into the community a lot were like super whack man they're super fucking whack they would be like teach me the hypnosis to hypnotize girls into sucking my balls like you know as all NLP and all the shit and they'd wear all this weird fucking clothes like are they maybe or they'd be like extremely fucking unlike awkward to the point of like autism now you see more normal guys like you know most guys in here seem pretty normal but back in the day was fucked up and we were no exception we were no exception to that rule so for me I had trouble even keeping eye contact with people or even much less saying talking to them so it's a process of progressive desensitization for me like I would start out I would walk down the street okay let's just make eye contact with people okay did that now let's say hi to everyone that I pass on the street hi hi some people would be like don't talk to me some people bug oh hello like how are you and engaged a conversation the vast majority would just be like and like continue on it's like okay I'm not vaporized let's move on next engaging in like short conversations next extending those conversations next injecting more humor in my personality next escalating verbally and physically next hitting make outs nice getting phone numbers next getting dates next getting same night lays then upping the challenge and then like getting like strippers threesomes fucking sex on the moon there's many parallel focuses that encompass this game and you know you can't expect to learn them all at once so I you know one of those books that we always recommend is mastery by George Leonard this is a great book on the topic of cultivating skills in this very you know measured way and when you're making these little moves you you have to enjoy the process you got to celebrate small victories you're gonna have little success along the way savor and enjoy them you can't be that guy who hates going to the gym you know cuz you're not going to go if you hate going to the gym you're not going to go I remember when I - when I first started out I'd go to the club and just just outside hearing the music I would be like like frightened I'd be like dude this sucks I got to go do this man oh man this place this noised under there now I go to the club and I'm like I got walk into excess I'm like yeah like my face lights up like it's fucking Space Mountain or something at Disneyland and like I've learned to like really enjoy that in many ways we think about the club's like the worst environment for humans to be it's like this like ear-splitting bullshit with idiots getting drunk like one thing that always was funny to me back in the day was they say if you're intimidated by the club and you're in the club just imagine what it would be like if the music was turned was muted and the lights came up what would you see you would see a bunch of idiots acting stupid in a filthy room right that's really it's really what it is so but again so the thing is rome wasn't built in a day you got to take satisfaction in hitting those plateaus you know the small repetitive task going out approaching pushing yourself reflecting seeing where you're at and challenging yourself to step up okay  incorporating those lessons day in and day out that is what's going to build a strong foundation of game and not just this flash-in-the-pan shit 26 when a whole leaves your ass don't try to figure it out all women are fickle hoes are no different women function on 99.9% of motions bitches leave for the dumbest reasons or no reason at all least of all the reason you think it is and I'll tell you something else if you know why she left you weren't pimping a real pimp spots a problem he's obligated to solve it and that's why when the whole leaves you don't supposed to know why sometimes I'll know why and I just don't care alright I'll just like let it go I just don't give a shit but you know I'm not necessarily trying to keep him you know she's on my team of course I'm gonna be upset if she's like a member of the team she's falling out of orbit dude I'm not some fucking heartless monster you know I'm gonna be upset but I'm not going to wring my hands trying to figure out why it happened oh woe is me in the mist okay so yes you want to reflect but the shark has to keep moving sharks got to keep moving I'll give it a cursory once-over in my head to see where I screwed up you know for future reference but you know because I'm a work in progress like everyone else obviously but you know I'm trying to hold things down at this stage it's more of a constant relearning of the principles because there's only so many principles I mean we can make this shit complicated we can make it really complicated or we can make it as simple as possible and at the end of the day there is just a handful of principles that you're going to reiterate rillette constant reaching of the neural pathways constant reshaping the myelin in those neural pathways and it's a tree learning so you know you'll occasionally fall off but in many ways it's a continuum last but not least learn how to pimp a hoe after she's chose and come back now that's the one problem you have and you get the kind of hoes at stake you start to like them even love them when they get out of pocket you tend to take it personal try to remember this above all no matter how much of a motherfucker you are no matter how long you have the hoe and she never got in a pocket no matter how much game you and the hoe kicked which he does get out of pocket remember a bitch is always going to be a bitch as a bitch is a bitch is a bitch that means get over it and pimp son you know I had a girlfriend for the past couple of years and we we broke up briefly in December and then it came to a head again and we kind of broke up a couple of months ago and now she's kind of coming back around now with that it's interesting cuz like he says you know you shouldn't know why she left but with this this is like my primary relationship and I've been in many ways mulling this shit over my head because to me the central riddle of the game that that fucking riddle that paradox of the game is the going out and beasting versus the security of relationship and how to balance those do you just go back and forth do you do this do you do that and I want to figure out where I fucked up cuz I thought I had it dialed with this last one but evidently I did and I made some mistakes so so I've been really mulling over that and honestly what's going to happen when you come back we come back after the break I'm really going to break down all my current understandings on how to properly run multiple relationships and really make it work and I've been studying the shit for the entirety of my career doing this okay and I think I've really got some good insights that I've taken from multiple sources and my own experience that are going to help out okay so after the break we'll get into that but Rosebud he finishes out with this he says as I said earlier I learned the importance of having principles early on the reason you must have out principles is because it's quite easy to not have any shit you can do as you please anytime you please so why have principles so your ass can live without them it's quite easy to die now we're gonna have a little interlude here and so what I want you to do let's like you know try to make it just 10-15 minutes I'm going to start back up at was it for the safe five forty five and what I'm going to leave you with to exit the room as you urinate is a little musical song that evil Stifler and I recorded in the car one night in the van while we were shit-faced and it is entitled bitches like to suck my dick I makes money  door my door bitches like to fellate my co stole my door bitches like to fellate my door that's how we roll special g money that's how we roll bitches get money fish is like a sock legit I makes money bitches like to suck my dick I make money bitches like a suck my dick I makes money this is what to suck my dick I

D I makes money,hkBjSe44Uk4
you sir no it will that shit will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever happen NSP I don't think it's a good thing or a bad thing it just is what it is everybody can't be a fucking boss you know there's got to be like people who aren't and most people aren't most people don't want to be that most people don't because again why putting yourself out there like that it's like that old Australian thing the tall poppy gets cut like you're exposing yourself people are gonna you're gonna have haters and shit like that most people are totally fine you know just having like a mediocre wife you know who loves them and have their 2.3 kids and the fucking pool in the backyard and that's fine like dude some of my best friends are monogamous okay sounds like I have monogamous friends like some of my best friends or monogamous but you know I'm not hating on that lifestyle at all I think for a lot of people it's great and in many ways I wish I could be that guy I wish I could be satisfied with that you know what I mean but again it's like you're gonna be hating on but you know who said it Aristotle I think it's like if you want to like have no critics then do nothing be nothing do nothing say nothing be nothing so this is always going to be like kind of a fringe outlier thing I mean but I think the forces that shape what we call the mainstream wouldn't there's no room for every guy to be googled women it's just let's face it there are highly objectionable aspects of what we do in particular the mass approaching but that's required you have if you want to cultivate a noticeably improved social intelligence you have to have massive repetition of social interaction and the thing is that gets misinterpreted by the mainstream people as as you know spam approaching they don't care about any one girl it's like okay yeah but you hey that's a necessary part of the process but they can't that's indigestible for them you know they can't they can't like susp am approaching spam approaching like i don't think they can don't ever be able to deal with that I mean yeah you could package it in different ways I guess but I think ultimately if we're talking about what actually works I think it's always going to be kind of like this nice subset I mean but by the same token it's a pretty big fucking niche - yes in the what is that the dog shirt yeah the certain kind of a mindset question and issue I've had nice guys too nice and it's like sometimes there's a hot girl there's another guy who said yeah actually yeah this is a big one and this is a big one for guys starting out there because people are people are nice like most people in here most I probably consider themselves nice people you know I mean I'm a nice person you want to think of yourself as a nice person my family likes me my friends think I'm a nice guy my co-workers probably used as well hopefully you know and and you know you see these guys in the club and you don't want to fuck you don't want to fuck with shit you know you don't want to rock the boat make people upset and that's totally understandable but one to two things are number one you are not clairvoyant okay you are not telepathic you you do not know what that person's relationship is with her you do not know okay so everyone always assumes what it's the boyfriend she's here with him and it may very well be it may very well be well you don't fucking know that you know what I think well now I'd like I mean again and this may very well not be either but you know what I think when I see the girl there with a guy it's her gay little brother who's also retarded and that's why she has to hold his hand so he doesn't run into the street and get hurt when I find out what I find out that it's the boyfriend most the time I'm not going to say dumb shit like that most of the time I'm gonna pick oh cool yeah uh what I will say especially if I'm in Vegas or like here or like any kind of big festival I bet Wow bring your girlfriend Vegas huh that's interesting you know bringing your significant other to Las Vegas it's a lot like bringing a warm beer to a bar where they serve free cold beer and everyone's like whoo cold beer like a spill in it and shit and you just got to sit there with your warm beer and just pretend you just love your warm beer anyway have a great time guys and like the chick always like glass or ass off the thing is it's funny to write or sometimes I'll do like this I'll beg oh you guys are together like what the fuck are you guys even doing here but excuse me like you have forfeited your right to have fun and they they're like starting get worked up like yeah cuz let's face it we both know so you guys gotta wake up early to go to the fucking farmers market and pick up some seasonal vegetables for your little Top Chef themed party with the other couples your own age and perhaps after where you know you cook you judge each other shit make some witty comments about each other's food then afterwards maybe some board games perhaps some Settlers of Catan a super fun board game it's about cooperation and sharing I usually collect wood early and go for the longest road yeah I know all about it and by this time they're all laughing and shit it kind of makes it funny you know and so so the thing is when I see those people later if I'm with a girl the COS said dude I might even bullshit with him for a little bit cuz I'm not trying to make like enemies in the club I'm trying to make like again I believe miss reset this years ago think of the club is 100 cent don't think of it as individual cent think if there's a hundred set right so you want to foster a little little mini micro relationships in there single-serving friends as tyler durden would call them and kind of like you know so when I'm rolling through I'll be like yeah what's up like hey it's that guy they might even buy your fucking drink probably you know go up with the mentality like have a positive mentality that you're going to find out you know you're going to find out speculation is inadmissible in the court of play now here's another thing let's say there's three people it could be it could be a Rando Rando commando it could be the boyfriend it could or could be a friend if it's the friend I'm gonna treat him like like a fat girl which means a win a fuck oh no I I i if but I'm gonna treat you like a girl I'm not interested in so like the food like the Fred I'm not interested so I'm gonna be like I'm gonna be I'm gonna be like flirt with him for the sake of flirting if that makes sense like I gotta from Julien's pimp he's like it you know if you have two girls you flirt with this girl with actual dick behind it you flirt with this row for the sake of flirting okay and the thing is when you do that the girls know what you're doing and they're like okay this guy's knows what's up and they appreciate that and a lot of times you know the the one you're not interested in will I kind of give her blessing and she'll like just fuck off because she sees that you know what the fuck you're doing right um and she'll like you to you win her over to so that's that's one thing so I'll treat the guy like if it's a friend I'll treat him like that now I may not I may just get the number in that case because a girl a girl that's there with her guy friend might be more reluctant to get pulled than if she was there with her girlfriend because he might be like you know slut-shaming like oh so Wendy the other night gosh she's such a slut oh this book dude right whereas the girl might be oh you go girl you know what high five right but the guy might be like a little more judgmental so and a lot of those times I might get the number and then spend my my time what more wisely elsewhere in the environment right now again if it's the boyfriend I'll do that whole spiel like yeah haha joke joke joke and then leave if it's Randall commando I will fucking dude I will just ignore his ass I will ignore his fucking ass I will but I won't even look at I won't even look at him until the girl acknowledges him and again she does not to verbally acknowledge him but if she's like kind of looking at him whatever then and he's like trying to shade say shit to me I might say one thing to him but that's the thing one fucking thing that's a big thing I see with new guys they get wrapped up in these like extended interactions with these men like these guys come in he's like oh hey man oh yeah cool bro oh shit man away from oh yeah I'm funky there are you dude I have sport or sports man I sports - sports get smart sports get all sports bro or college or Boo Boo's do it like and then and then the girls I kind of fade off and congrats and then probably or maybe his buddy comes and swoops away and it was like it was like a wingman scam and now you're there talking to a dude congratulations you're now talking to a man yeah but the thing is you had to be ruthless with these fuckers and you don't want to be nice like look look here's the thing in a club how many like really attractive girls are in a club even at a big club hey like 20 you know so you are competing with every other guy in there for those limited resources of the you know these women's attention so dude these guys are not your friends they're going to steamroll your fucking ass right quick they're going to not even think about it so you've got to kind of develop that that mentality but the thing is man even if I do win and I I do meet the guy I'm gonna be gracious in victory you know and I'll be like huh yeah man you know and I've even said like I think that guy's funky it looks like you won bro like I even had that hat that should happen like outside of the club and the pole war and stuff any guy who has enough skill to be an actual like challenge to you is likely to understand that do you know what I mean it's only the guys who fucking suck we're gonna get butthurt and they don't even matter anyway the group I won t be to them in a way  you,hw8V5KH6E6Y
hey-oh congratulations you have made it to the fifth day of the resonator video preview series without being murdered without falling off the cliff so congratulations now in the previous videos I talked about the foundation of the program which was vocal projection including both the science behind developing a powerful attractive voice as well as the so-called rubber meets the road application of these concepts and field and in your everyday life on top of that foundation we've built additional modules covering the grammar of storytelling as well as the mastery of humor and now we're gonna add the icing on the cake with some fun stuff that takes it out of the classroom and into the real world so I've included several segments of infield footage with resonator so you can see the practical application of this stuff in real time so first we start off with an infield coaching video and in this one I take a student out on boot camp and when the night begins his vocal projection it fucking sucks it's extremely horrible it's very weak his tonality is needy they barely even acknowledge that he's there in most of these cases so after this I take him aside and I coach him through the resonator techniques until he's able to get a um shall we say more positive result okay and as you witnessed this all go down I'm there with you on screen providing ongoing color commentary it's coming around that way intercept intercept intercept  Wow so that was quite sad that is a byproduct of what we call half-stepping which is what he did he went in with zero conviction I did not get the impression that he actually wanted the girl to stop he just wanted to go up get the instructor off his back I did my approach instructor they checked a little tally mark because while ostensibly yeah he thinks he does want to get laid on the other hand he doesn't want the girl to stop because of that she stopped then he'd have to actually talk with her and he knows he's sorely lacking in that department in terms of his game mechanics and so on and so forth so he doesn't actually want that to happen subconsciously at least like a bit like a nice big noise but you also put like a nice tone and you want to be able to like consistently do that right so it's like all that stuff that we were talking about today that's what brings it in so remember it starts from here so that's how you can like get that breath control just abused oh oh you waste it all yeah right so you want to be able to like it's almost like think of it like a reservoir of fuel that you want to conserve as you're as you're talking case that's number one number two we talked about again mushy number one - the posture yeah your posture seems pretty fucking good right now it seems pretty good because that's the first thing the second thing is what the breath management okay the third thing we want to focus on the tone production bouncing off that hard palate okay so again you're going up you're like good evening I do it right now good evening good evening right like a little like up more up good evening through the evening okay where do you live  do you have any bushes outside I can perhaps conceal myself in lover chicken and a ski man that was amazing because they were like totally throughout by you're like whatever and it didn't like you but Sally says something really funny they're like immediately I'll turn right so that's the thing right so that's the thing I go in very big I go in very big like if I were you like open technology I like decide that's a shit well number one I go in with big emotional color number two I believe and I truly believe this it's only a matter of time until they like me and if I go like 90% of the time girl's gonna give you that look she's gonna give you this look right look at this look at this it almost looks like and it's a different person right just look at the look in his eyes well I guess you can kiss bird but he's got this like fire in his eyes as he looked at this girl look at that how he's closed the distance look how he's squared up with her and right in her actual face he's picking her up he's actually it looks like a man to woman versus like this little child that he was in the previous night and and it's just fucking him on it's just on he's like boom what's up girl I'm in your space I'm a man I'm into you I want it to work I don't need it to work Here I am he puts himself in that middle space and allows her to meet him there and you can see she's quite enthusiastic about meeting him in that middle space it's like of course she's gonna go with the next infield video features a romantic tryst in a van you see everything as I employ the resonator techniques to cut through the loud music get her attention make her laugh and finally persuade her to walk me to my vehicle to enjoy each other's company further away from the prying eyes of the public so to speak  and again listen to my tone Alan either it's all like oh hey how's it going - oh hey haria it's like this very relaxed almost studied in different studied nonchalant but then BAM and I go and I write into the pinky swear right so an immediate hit of like physicality right off the bat that's kind of playful and fun again it's like it's playful it's fun it's bold right that that just came to me right off the bat right teasing is uh like this this kind of playful teasing it's so good because it's like what is it sub communicating that you're not putting her up on a pedestal right that you're able to kind of tease around and not be this guy who's like Oh pussy mcmutt walk the egg shit walk on the eggshells and do the tightrope walk of trying to please her and make her think I'm cool right you really got to get away from that and just get into that headspace I'm just having fun now a lot of guys will say well if I'm just having fun and how is it gonna work it's like look remember you're creating the fun vibe that's what she associates those feelings with you and then you know the structure of the pickup's you're able to methodically move it along remember when I say these like and statements of intent and things like that the reason I'm doing that is to free up processor space because I'm only thinking about two things right I'm only consciously focusing really on a couple things and the number one is what is the girl giving me emotionally right now and how and you know what does that say man I need to kind of alter my approach a little bit or is it cool is it or is it going good and then secondly where am I in the interaction itself and what is the next step to get her you know to the end goal of obviously sex so here it's obviously very early but it you know the the girls hooked I'm kind of grandfathered in because of the friend here but I immediately go into that playful that playful headspace to be like you know kind of take her in that like this guy's different this guy's he's able to kind of play around with it and not be so serious not put pressure on it and then again just the way I'm squared up there in the way that I'm looking at her and my vocal tonality are already starting to sprinkle in a man to woman style of communication  [Applause] are you an are you an Inuit are you in native originally 40 too many shenanigans I'm I know my boss so like last week but they're all like drink more water of the guys I know my god why haven't you can like several weeks yeah you're the best estimate kisser I've seen yet yeah well one of the best harassment kisses are fucking on point yours you're on fleek they're on fleek just listen to this incessant flow of noise coming from my mouth as we said earlier the reason that I'm doing this is because I like like I said when we were doing the poll it's a series of moments where she's constantly continuing to make the decision to go with you so by saying this stuff I'm keeping it in that emotional space so now we're gonna arrive at the van and last but not least I roll out another clip that explores the power of misdirection now this one's a bit different than what you might be expecting what I did was I brought in a friend of mine who's a professional magician and I wanted to explore how he was his storytelling and what they call patter to direct girls attention where he wants it to go when he's doing magic and we really dig down into the principles behind it and we explore how guys might use these lessons to actually improve their cold approach pickup skills so the guy he hits the streets he performs some tricks for a variety of girls like I said we break it all down we explain what's going on psychologically and we show you how you can use this stuff to actually get laid without using any corny props or tricks allow me to introduce first of all my good friend Jeremy who is a professional magician and what we decided to do was explore how he uses what's called patter to direct people's attention where he wants it to go when he's doing magic okay so we went out on the street talked to some girls and I really wanted to explore kind of the parallels between you know the ability to direct people's attention where you want it to go as well as the same kind of principles in game right because obviously you want to be able to control the frame you want to be able to do all these things so again I wanted to check out and kind of like really explore the philosophy behind it and the mental approach kind of that you take to do it when you're meeting these strangers and you're kind of trying to get them to come into your world and believe this sure sure right so I guess we're gonna watch a couple of a couple of Clips here right right and before we get into that I mean I just want to talk a little bit about like things that I just kind of take for granted um but I just do naturally like this resonator program you know I also do a lot of singing as well and Ronco projection as well and it's just it's kind of fundamental in my thinking I mean I automatically just use great vocal technique wherever I go and Jeff does too now more than ever after working with Susan I've been working with Susan now for over a year and then I've worked with other vocal coaches as well for the ring and for the resonance and all these things that are in resonator but it's something I take for granted and it wasn't until I did this program with you that I realized I mean wow look at all of these things and I'm just doing just naturally and when I watch these clips of us doing magic and it's just it's it's just inherent and and you say it's so funny you've been saying all these clips like 80% of the problem 80% of time this is the problem right you have to teach this to your students that's like the first thing you have to get through and it's very often and it makes so much sense to me and you know and it's also this thing that once you get the technique down it's this idea of like what you have to say is important and and might my trips and my my what I'm gonna show these people I understand and I believe it firmly that it's probably be the coolest thing they see all day there's a lot kind of going on here there's a lot going on it's a very simple kind of thing but I'm gonna break it down right now a bizarre right but here's something even more weird and we don't even need any kind of props or anything put your hands out like this here oh okay go back to back okay so we're creating this on moment right now it's all of a sudden getting intense alright it's like okay put your arms up go back to pendent from it goes from casual shoulders down to okay put your arms like this go back to that no what I really love about this too it's like so much of what guys default to when they don't know game is is the the stupid interview now again this sure you know people could say off magics try-hards kind of corny whatever but at least it's not this fucking asking of questions do you understand it's like look I'm not gonna sit here and ask you all these goddamn questions like what I'm gonna do what now we're doing something that's engaging we're doing something that it's different doing something that's interesting it's a moment as you said where you're actually contributing something as opposed to like asking them to buy Bowie or stayed up or or like boost you up that's why I fucking love it so so what's going on here so I'm creating this on beat right because we're relaxed for a second it's like okay put your arms up go back to back and then I'll with my voice here what I'll do especially in a moment like this at a part where I can afford to kind of you know talk like this right so you're rolling excite okay you want see something cool okay boom and and I'm like here we go and I'm you know ringing and I'm projecting what's something cool great great okay yeah put some put your arms out like this okay go back to back and cross it over yeah yeah and now and wait does a lot of things right all of a sudden what my dad are used to telling me is like you want people to really listen to you Jeremy whisper he said that to me and I thought that it always stuck with me and and I love that and again creating tonality right and so you'll see in this clip here I immediately go look something cool and then all of a sudden I just start to whisper check it quarterback cross it over and link it together I'm about to fry her right now right and here's the thing and now that the work is in I write and I get silly and and I think it makes the impact should longer you know I David Williamson who's a wonderful magician he always told me he's like you know I'd like to put the bar low if I put the bar low and he's probably one of the greatest fight at hand artists in the world but he's like I'd like to I don't wait to come in all big I like to come in kind of small because when I blow them away I just have all this room to kind of do to grow into where if you come in kind of hard where do you go the ceilings already so high and here you know I put all this work in now I'm getting silly and now this moment is just about to blow up and she her reaction is actually very interesting here because um we I've come to the top she can't do it and she thinks just because people don't react sometimes they take it internally that didn't work that's in where CNN you see there was a little bit of a thing but she was thinking she was thinking how the fuck did he do that and then she laughed and let her off the hook and this ended a really good experience with Ciara here before I go allow me to remind you to sign up to that VIP interest list now so you'll be eligible for all the bonuses when you get your copy of resonator from June 21st

breakdown on what happened there now it is time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook thus at sets that set 80% of the time this is the problem [Music] [Applause] hey freeze motherfucker ain't good evening he doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him so why the fuck I the fuck should she this is the roof of the mouth right here eh right yes [Music] smelling something nice touching the shoulders ah that's the touchdown right they're not just being loud but being clear so this right sometimes people will say what what they heard you they heard the noise good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps with cheese and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding [Music] that sleeps so that was nice clenching it here or - yes and that's what we don't want okay that's we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow they're swollen this is probably what my boss is  [Music] I'm like literally cringing sit down shut up blah blah yeah but you're dumb you're dumb you're dumb dumb you're dumb your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a to MIT where we're telling stories do you want to be more excited or do you need to be more like calm and collected and that'll change often dynamically during the interaction itself it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice you're gonna be able to go out in projects take your finger like this and push it push it and then and that weird it's a weirdest thing when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I truly believe this it's only a matter of time until they like gave me a huge awareness of my voice and how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicalities behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling in humor put on a little fog film I write that you know some little act and that's mostly quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game contest I was like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself Jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve for so so so long [Music],i2pK2ziot2w
what I'll pose is Jeffy and welcome to yet another edition of between Tudors today we're gonna get into a little bit of mailbag action but before we do that I want to share with you some new technology that I've been working on here in the lab selfies now selfies are huge these days as we all know they're very popular not just with Asians we all know they originated there but it's constantly evolving and here today in 2015 I've been working on some new stuff now I know if you've seen execute the program you know that I'm in staunch opposition to the idea of taking selfies for your profile pics you know especially the the the bathroom mirror selfie with tooth place flex on the fucking mirror and all of your toiletries arrayed out in front of you however I'm working with some technology and what am I of course talking about well I'm talking about of course the selfie stick selfie stick as you can see here is absolutely amazing we can go on a journey throughout space and time we can be anywhere we can see anyone we can hide in a bush we can go up high and go down low I'm not going to get into it it's not fully developed yet but I do want to share with you one little tidbit that I've been working on and what it is is this so I shoot the girl of text and this is a girl that I may have been talking to for a while I haven't had the chance yet to hook up with know via text game you know I'll often tell guys if they can't meet up with a girl right away or they need a time bridge well then send her intermittent value giving text now guys are like waters what's a value giving text well it can be an anecdote about your day it could be something funny you saw I could be a funny meme whatever just a little thing that's gonna add some interest to her day so recently I sent a girl a simple text out of the blue I said wanna see my selfie stick and of course what's the first thing that they're going to imagine and you're talking about it's a you know a crude reference you're gonna set her a fucking dick pic right she's like not a dick pic I'm like don't be vulgar ho and then I send her this followed up by this so of course this gives the girl laughing it takes things in a set direction without being explicit a lot of guys have difficulty with the verbal component of Manta Munich man to woman communication for the tastings in a sexual direction without being you know this horndog fucking needy thirsty motherfucker or just a vulgar idiot so this is one good example of that now we've had a lot of fun with the selfie stick today's mailbag question comes from Dan who says hey Jeff recently you broke down the five different ways of one can communicate in a man to woman fashion and it was quite helpful I have two good questions on that as you know most of the time and daygame there's some sort of time constraint that prevents the girl from staying longer to talk therefore about half my detailed number clothes are from interactions that are under five minutes long so in a situation like that should I even worried about how man to woman I am being and if so how would that manifest itself now look I'd say yes and no I mean yes you definitely want to be man to woman no you do not want to worry about it so what do I mean by that well it doesn't necessarily matter what you're saying but you need to have the underlying tone be man to a man abso-fucking-lutely otherwise you're playing this kind of weird game where I call it surprise I have a dick right so when you finally do the longer it takes for you to actually begin communicating to the girl in a man to woman tonality if you will the weirder it's going to be when you finally do say surprise I have a dick now of course this does not mean even that you're explicitly saying or doing anything but your communication should be shot through with it from you know head to toe you should be doing that throughout the entire interaction now even if it is a five minute interaction let's look let's say I'm walking down the street with my buddy evil Stifler and we roll up on some girl and we'll just strike up a conversation with her make some sort of you know situational comment what-have-you but I can assure you even though we're just being some friendly guys the girl knows god damn well she it's communicated very very clearly like if I'd get alone with these guys there they're gonna take their dick out right for lack of a better way to put it you know these guys will fuck these guys are not gonna be little pussies about it but at the same time they're not gonna be fuckin garish jerks who are like filet greatly escalating on me when I'm not giving them any feedback indicating that I'm down with it right any indicators of interest so a two to five minute interaction for us might look like this popper open you know we might make some little like funny little sexual like comments like angling towards that like damn girl you look like a little angel anyway dun dun da da da and then actually has to go you know we'll fuck around and have a good time with it have like a fun little interaction but then when she's got to go we just go oh hey well cool so there's a party later tonight I'll tell you what give me a number we'll shoot you a tax tell you where it's at should be pretty good right and then of course follow up later now spoiler alert the party is in my pants so the second question that he has here is as follows secondly I followed your work for quite some time and I know you're big and I was standing directly in front of the woman now aside from doing that do you recommend being man to woman from the beginning or starting off with just non sexualized chatter and ramping up the man to women stuff as she continues to display more of her personality thus she will feel as though she has worked for your affections and that her personality is a big part of the reason why you're turned on hope to hear back my friend now tough fucking love time here maybe her personality is the reason that you're fucking turned on maybe maybe she's out of the sparkling wit of a fuck it you know she's Voltaire like she's amazing she's she's a great person but let's fucking face it the reason you're not turned on because of her fuckin personality hopefully maybe you are but the vast majority of the time in a quickie and erect it quickie and irrational when you're first getting to know someone it is it is physical let's not try to fucking put lipstick on a pig here okay girls just want to have fun guys just want to have fun it can it can be just that it's fine so if you're saying like oh I need to make her think that it's her personality why do you mean to need to make someone think anything you understand the girl should be wanting to hook up with you because you're fun cool you're giving her a good experience and you move forward sexually you're not you're making some bones about it like trying to hide it like a some shameful fucking secret right so let me ask you this think of a guy who you think it was good with women right let's say fucking Brad let's say evil Stifler let's say fucking evil silver do you think do you think that this guy when he's interacting with girls he's thinking shit like you know what I need to play a loof and not express myself sexually so she thinks that I like her for her personality and then I'll reward her when she's earned it do you think a guy like that actually fucking things like that no he's not like some miser doling out his affections for those who earn it that is kind of like a seller mentality that's kind of a loser a loser a mentality to put it bluntly I suppose no instead if you look at it evil Jimmy he's just a guy when he interacts with people everyone gets it everyone gets all of his like fun all of his personality all of like the good times they get the benefit of the doubt he gives people the benefit of the doubt and he shares his personality with them until they prove themselves unworthy see that's the distinction it's not like you're just some idiot who's like being nice to everyone the thing is I'm nice to everyone and guys who are good with girls are just like very happy very friendly very outgoing generally until it's not deserved right until the girl says something that's out of line in which case we'll be like get the fuck outta you busted ass bitch you know or totally some guys just says some stupid a bitch fuck you motherfucker and punch him in the fucking face right so it's not like this is happy nice guy going around oblivious it's like no yeah respect does on the one hand need to be earned but generally a guy who's like go walking through the world with ease and who people are attracted to he gives it away freely until there's a reason - okay so instead think of it like that so when you're going up to the girl don't be like when do when does she get the gift of my sexual affections it's like no man it's like we're all people here you know we're grown fucking adults people like to have sex that's it I think you're cute do you think I'm cute hey that's fun if not hey that's fun too until of course you know they prove otherwise so always want to go man to him from the very beginning and I talk about this all the time to this black and white mentality this black and white thinking that prevails off in especially in newer guys who think that they they have to do one or the other they either have to be groping they're like powerbombing the hole with their dick or standing there like in the fucking corner like with their back turn to the girl like talking to her over the shoulder to show just interest okay not-it's a continuum but again the subtext the sub communication always needs to be man to woman right it needs to be that even if you're not like being aggressive it just needs to be there that that kind of smirky flirtation should underlie the entire thing from the very beginning so anyway um I'm gonna go play with myself II stick there's been Jeffy and I'll see you next time on rst nation,iPGa55P868I
blessings children in his eye father J now you might be saying yourself what's this all about I thought Julian was father J well other J it's more of really an idea and father J sort of resides within all of us at least if your name begins with J so again father J Bishop J where the fuck you want to call me gets me and I'm here and I got a special message today for those of you who don't know much about this whole pick up stuff and are thinking about getting into it if you want to join the cult of pick up I'm here to tell you the 10 commandments that you need to know to begin to reengineer your thought processes before you can even start to really learn this stuff with any sort of hope of actually internalized everything you know is wrong everything you know about dating at least is wrong so what does that mean come into it with an open mind your preconceived notions leave them all at the door because when you start getting out there and you start learning this stuff for real and seeing it with your own eyes a lot of the stuffs gonna blow your mind and you're not going to believe again it's a lot of it is counterintuitive a lot of is running so counter to what the conditioning that you've experienced the past several decades of your life most likely has led you to believe that's going to be difficult to swallow so again check all that shit at the door come into it with an open mind and be willing to accept unpleasant truths one thing I always tell guys who are on bootcamp is not always but sometimes guys come into it and you know they want the game to be a certain way and I always tell these guys this look at how it actually works don't look at it how you'd like it to work so rule number one everything you know about dating is wrong rule number two romantic grand gestures that kind of like grand romantic stuff that kind of stuff only works with women once you already have a trashin once you're already in a relationship or she's already completely head over heels at you and I think that every one of us is guilty of having done some kind of like romantic gesture you know the whole John Cusack's standing with the boombox over his head outside of her door type of stuff I know for me that moment came in the eighth grade when I went out on like my first date with some girl and it turned out she actually liked some friend of mine so over the summer I wrote her an extremely like heartfelt letter like detailing and my love for her and all the stuff and then I left it on her doorstep and like I ran away and I like rang the door I didn't like ran away well guess what that was over the summer and then when I actually went to school after summer like ended and school began again this like letter was basically like the talk of the school and I was like the assclown of the fucking school so didn't quite work out so well so remember grand romantic gesture is great once you're already in relationship not so great to actually win her over before that rule number three attraction is an emotional response not a logical one and what that means is you cannot logically persuade girls to become attracted to you in what am I talking about here you you know saying like hey I would be great for you this is why we would be great together or demonstrating why you're like the perfect match for and stuff like that qualifying yourself as we as we say again try to argue with her logically in any way that's not how this works people make decisions not just from an attraction standpoint but people in general make decisions from an emotional space not a logical space so you need to get that in your head rule number four being good with women isn't something that you do it's something that you are so what this means is you're going to have to yes you are gonna have to learn certain mechanical nuts-and-bolts tactics type stuff but that's not what's ultimately going to get you there what's going to get you there is learning the kind of man that women actually respond to and endeavoring to be that person so when you're going out you'll have to turn on the pick up persona you just go out you be yourself and it happens naturally rule number five to get the one special girl you need to first learn how to be good with all women in general this is something that I hear from a lot of like-new it's like why can't I just practice on one girl it's like no and this is another reason why you have to go out and interact with a lot of people it's the old maxim to gain a noticeably improved level of social intelligence you must actually have a mass repetition of social interaction that means you need to go out and talk to a lot of people it starts to see the patterns emerge of how people respond and start to learn just in general how to be more empathetic and emotionally attuned to people and again see how the structure works and it happens not by getting the one particular girl but by first learning how to be good with women in general rule number six women actually like sex the paradigm like a lot of social conditioning is guys are the horndogs they're always like come on girl come on girl what a fuck wanna fuck and girls are just like you know oh these disgusting horn dogs I you know running around oh I guess I'll let him do it it's like no the truth is actually women love sex just as much as man in fact in a lot of case I think they like it more than like not to generalize it's never wise to indulge in generalizations but a lot of women love sex a lot more than a lot of guys do I have some roommates and I over the years I've lived with a lot of women I've had a lot of female friends and to hear how they talk about sex behind closed doors a lot of times would blow your mind especially if you're a newbie when they go out there on any given night they're open to the idea of getting laid because they like sex just as much if not more than guys now the question is then why do they seem so resistant if they like liked it so much well the bottom line is they're not out there running a sex charity for losers right they don't want it with any guy they want to with the right guy rule number seven most women screen their long-term partners for more of a logical standpoint and take longer in the decision-making process when they're talking about casual sex partners logic does not intrude upon that decision most of the time it happens very quickly again the long-term provider guy they're going to look for those markers and an approach from a logical standpoint but in the short-term for a casual sex partner it's the guy who's able to go up again strike an emotional chord and make it happen quickly rule number eight a man's attractiveness is helped but by no means ultimately determined by his looks and bank account a lot of guys will tell you you know the conditioning the conventional wisdom if you will says it's all looks money and status now again that stuff's great that stuff can help it's great for your personal happiest personal well-being but ultimately at the end of the day a man's attractiveness is determined almost entirely by his behavior and last but not least number nine being good with women is a skill like anything else and yes you can learn it with practice I know I said there was ten rules but there's actually nine why it doesn't matter so but those are some very fundamental rules that as a beginner are gonna help you to start to re-engineer your belief systems so you're gonna be more open to what you need to learn in order to get this stuff done and be successful with it on a very consistent basis all right thanks a lot this has been Bishop J blessings be with you sit down shut the fuck up don't hit your fucking brother you like it Wow does it feel you like that don't do this don't do that sit down shut up blah blah the other bit you're dumb you're dumb you're dumb yeah damn dumb you're dumb your clothes are stupid you know all this shit over

"[Applause]  so you guys you know you probably been attending all these talks and stuff and you've heard a lot a lot of different perspectives a lot of different tips I think it's fair to say they're almost everything you've heard has been based on anecdotal evidence didn't even come up these this week and like presents a scientific study about a cow attraction works one guy who is this the old guy isn't that me I'm the fucking two all the I but yeah you know this this stuff ever since the beginning it's all been anecdotal evidence it's been grounded in anecdotal evidence and that's I think what you know one reason why they call it pickup art as opposed to pickup science because I think that science really hasn't contributed much for this you know it's all anecdotal you guys anyone in here know who Mark Roberto is wrote a book called starting strength which is kind of a very well regarded book about how to get started in strength and conditioning someone asked Rick Ito like they asked them they said what do you see as the role of empirical well-controlled studies scientific studies in stirring the conditioning and he said this he said they have made essentially no useful contribution to strengthen conditioning none strength the conditioning depends almost entirely on anecdotal evidence and it's collation and evaluation by experienced coaches this is because there are so few well-designed studies it makes little difference how well controlled they are now I think the same holds true for for pick up what are some like studies you've heard about attraction like basically I mean something about facial symmetry or some shit like this right like women prefer facial symmetry but the thing is I've been doing this for super 16 years and I've seen so many guys from all different walks of life succeeded this shit in crazy fucking waves very recently I had a kid I had a boot camp in New York this is a couple months ago last month actually two months ago and I had three guys one guy was a tall six foot two ripped black dude good very you know classically handsome second guys from Texas also six to white guy jacked classically handsome third guy was this 21 year old kid from Pakistan who weighed about like a buck 20 soaking wet and was like a manic psycho okay like like running around like running the girl's face hey lady don't like severe accent severe fucking accent which guy do you think got lady Pakistani guy the other guys were so wrapped up in their own fucking mental problems their own social conditioning social pressure like under this fucking weight that they could not lift off of themselves throughout the course of the weekend but this kid for whatever reason he had the emotional leverage and and he made it happen and it was kind of funny too because I think he we were at with the foot 235th you know that rooftop place and he's talking to this girl and her boyfriend was there and he starts talking to her and the first night he was like really spastic we told him go you need to chill the fuck out you need to go from a 10 to a 2 bro ok a 10 to a 1 right he's like ok ok so he chilled out a little bit talking to the girl the boyfriends like why the fuck are you talking to this guy and she's like I'm just talking to him he's like fuck you and the boyfriend storms out of the club  wrong move yeah so this kid he's like he's talking to the girl he's trying to pull her and she's like she's like no I can't go with you I can't go with you so he leaves he comes back to us we're like dude go back go back he's like I tried to pull it didn't work well I just go back she's still there he goes back tries to pull again she won't go like move around the club a little bit go back go back finally he like disappears and I'm like where the fuck did this guy go and I sent him a text actually let me like show you the text here this gets quite amusing I'm like what's your status man he's like gonna smash her in hotel mad misses dream can't believe what happened I'm like believe it don't stop believin bro he takes the pictures like oh my god that test fuck it all night hey I'm like this shit is real man right because that's the big thing like I think that I think that guys need to see a lane that this shit is real right so he's like this is a new beginning and then he's like she just called me a fucking pimp lol daddy boy right so it's like this guy it was like dear this is gonna be a rough weekend you know what I mean but that's why I continue to do this cuz like I never like sometimes like in the initial impression of the guy I'm like oh this guy like what I'm sitting there at the pre-brief but you never know from that initial impression who's gonna do it and and the the bare fact of the matter is that guy he he got that emotional leverage right and I really think that that is what enables someone to again lift that you got to get a fulcrum otherwise you cannot lift that crushing fucking weight of the social conditioning off you it's 20 years of this shit or more you know some guys 40 years you know I have students this weekend who are in there in their mid-40s the schooling system your peer group the media your parents corporate culture etc etc it's telling you to stay in your little box to protect yourself from the judgement of the group puts you in what we call that defensive little me where even if you know exactly what to do cuz most you in here at relatively smart dudes I imagine probably a couple of dummies in here you know but whatever bell curve but like you know what to do you know what to fucking do but how many guys like can know what to do like how many of you had has a situation where you go out and you sort of get this kind of paralysis you can't take action you know I've had that as well I've had that as well still struggle with it to this day and like of course I've installed tools in my brain too like number one recognize when it's happening like so I don't just go into that mode or my door right on my Oh social conditioning social pressure and then I've also developed ways to kind of crack that off and push back and actually be effective the environment and be at what we call again the cause and of the things in the environment not the effect end of things the environment and that really is what I think is the mission statement of RSD it's you know to get guys laid but it's really to get guys in the driver's seat of their own life you have to find your own personal fulcrum for that emotional leverage otherwise you cannot lift that shit off of you you can't so what does emotional leverage it's where you reach like that breaking point again Tony Robbins talks about this all the time where it's the idea where the potential pain of making the change the potential pain or fear of the consequences of making the change has now become outweighed by the very real very immediate visceral pain of continuing to do things the way you've been doing them for me I had several points that caused me to arrive at that point right or several things incidents in my life that caused me to arrive at that point like for example the one of the very first was bad breakups you know probably the same old sob story that you guys have heard before and you guys probably experienced this too a lot of you guys in this room you have some fucking bad breakup and you're like an F this shit's bullshit I'm gonna be a player right and then even when I was in it I would have like just reinforcement so like I remember one time I was I was hanging out with this girl I had got her number I went over and I was hanging out with her she's like I was like you you want to go out she's like well I can I'm moving today but you can come over and hang out I was like okay so I go over to her house and literally I'm like making out with this chick on the couch and some dude walks walks by carrying a box like who's who's this she's like oh that's my friend bill and it was like an orbiter like some fucking or she's like yeah he really wants to hook up with me edit it out she had made some fucking orbiter chode is moving her shit while I'm like finger banging on the couch and he's like oh hey can I should I put it in the truck he literally and I'm like fuck dude I just dude I don't want to be that fucking guy you know I don't know more serious note I didn't want to like lose my shit like my fucking father he he went to prison for many years he went to prison for about eight years Pelican Bay Supermax he found out my mother was cheating on him and he's lost his shit you're like a very middle middle class like upper middle class corporate executive basically never had a parking ticket lost his shit kidnapped both him at gunpoint went to prison for eight fucking years why because a woman left him so you know I was like fuck I never want this shit to have that much power over me and of course I probably fucked me up in a lot of other ways too but we're like keeping people at a distance and stuff like that but but again that's that's not the point of this so you got to find your own leverage points where you say enough right ya basta they taught to re ass like enough of this fucking shit I'm done I'm gonna do whatever it takes to get this done whether that's in your fitness goals whether that's in your financial goals whether it's in this right and now here I am you know at 42 and I've had periods where I've got happening how many can relate to this I've had periods where I've been absolutely slaying this at the shit and then maybe I had a couple months where I was just like I couldn't make anything work at all and I was just like is it over is the mojo gone is it done for me you know what I mean and then it comes back so this stuff is very cyclically right but again here I am age 42 I've had like experiences that most average guys in the general population would literally wouldn't believe you know and you see it in a lot of these like YouTube comments it's out there like this shit ain't real you know paid actresses whatever stuff like that it's just this mentality that this stuff is not possible right and I think that's one thing why I love doing bootcamp so much I love seeing the look in the eyes when the guys realize that it's possible when they realize it's real there are guys that live this lifestyle and it's very it's very possible there's a lane they see the lane because you can know all the information and stuff in the world but if you don't believe it in your mind you don't see the lane for making it work and achieving this eventually you're you're not going to do it now that I've sort of like made the myths I've achieved a level of success into this and you know become in other areas too like financially I'm pretty comfortable and stuff like that well now a different angle kind of starts to creep in okay and this is something that our old buddy Gary Vee and one fan of Gary Vaynerchuk you know he talks about this quite a lot and it's this idea that entitlement is fucking cancer this idea that you deserve continued success because you had past success this shit needs to be fucking eradicated out of your mentality right so it might be a sobering thing to hear but it's absolutely true you're only as good as your last at-bat but the funny thing is I'm still having fucking novel experiences even at age 42 this shit never ends how many guys in here are either like early 20s joy hands okay so a large portion so you know I used to think when I was in my my 20 years like and I was starting out with this if I have you really start doing it until I was like 25 26 but I was like you know what I'll do this shit tell him like 30 then I'll settle down right and then I turned 30 and I'm like well I don't feel different I may as well keep Bank in the hose right I just kept doing it and then I was like well 40s coming around you know that's a thing and yeah as my sex drive got down a bit yeah it has you know and then also when you fuck like 400 girls like your your desire to like hook up with yet another seven kind of declines because you get very very picky dude you don't even like it for me to hook up with something like on an average looking girl at least you know in my estimation and averaging you girl like I would I would be like okay I've had sex with this girl like 15 times before not her but someone who essentially looks identical to her like her hair her facial shape her body shape you know it's essentially the same person so for me I have like it's like stratified into these like very specific types that if I see those I know I'm like yeah like like my nostrils flare and I just step to him very hard but they're fewer and far between and sex drives gone down a little bit but still I'm still having fucking like crazy novel experiences just a couple of months ago I had something that like on a boot camp that had never happened before and basically what it was I was it was Saturday night on the boot camp second out of the program I had two three students two of them were like very novice you know white belts yellow belts very very little experience and I was looking for I was looking for them two of them had kind of like disappeared into the ether of the club so I'm riding around looking for him I go outside this was like a little smoking area out there I'm like yo I say to my assistant like Hill have you seen this fucking the student and he's like yeah dude he's fucking in the van and I'm like oh really he's like yeah dude it was on he was making out there they went to the van I'm like okay Wow awesome and then about that time the student walks back up with the girl and he's got her and he's like like he's like walking on sunshine like fucking Katrina in the waves and she had like he's like you could tell he just fucked right he's like all rosy cheeked and shit and I'm like hey man how'd it go he's like dude I can't believe it fucking fuck to the van I did do that he's like yeah and you saw in his eyes that was the moment where he like saw the lane that I was talking about you know like he did not fucking believe it like I remember on Friday the previous night when I meet the guys I meet them in the van like I'd meet them at some coffee shop and I'm like hey I'm Jeff all right let's go and then I like we get in the van that door opens that people always asks why do you slam the door like that which is the door weighs 400 fuckin pounds okay it's made out of steel it's like a 1980 okay so slam that fucking door and they're sitting in there and that like pink light and they're just like all a lot of times they'll say shit like is this clean I don't want to touch anything I'm like oh you don't and I take out like a fucking black light and I'll start like shining it I'm like you see any fucking sperm here you see any nothing like no it looks really clean I'm like what about on you and then I put it on their pants there'll be like little stains it says like you're your dirty one motherfucker get out of my bed right I say that cuz girls would say shit like that I'd find stains on them and shit so but but then I'm like so anyway long story short I'm saying okay here's where the key to the van is here's how you get in there's a spare key a little lockbox blah blah and as I'm saying this the condoms are here as I'm saying this to them you can see in their eyes they're like no fucking web there's no way in hell I'm fuckin in this van this is never gonna happen ever right and they're just like no and then again to see him walk up on this Saturday after you just did it like it's like he's like it's real you know what I mean it's real because they don't know it's real maybe there's still a part of them even though they signed up they put these resources in they flew out whatever there's a part of me that like maybe this is like some kind of scam you know what I mean like maybe this guy's fucking bullshit and you know but then at that moment I saw it and that's why I continue to do this that's one of the big fucking reasons also boot camp keeps me out of trouble on the weekends okay keeps me off the streets it's like an after-school program keeps me away from the gangs and the violence you know but it's kind of crazy that's what seeing that change it makes me nostalgic from when I had my first experiences in the game like when I had my first pull my first lay from a cold approach and I remember walking out of the girls house like to my car and I was like it's real you know like like you're a wizard Harry like that kind of like come to Jesus moment you know and it was so fucking amazing and I was like just giddy and so anyway while I'm like debriefing him on this I see his girl that that he just painted the van she's off to the side and my girl that I do the threesomes with she's like talking to her now and she's like starts making out with her and I'm like like hey dude do you mind if I get sloppy seconds on this and he's like I don't give a fuck so I'm like hey happy family and I started like making I would bulb them and then I'm like all right dude  I'm like alright we're gonna go back to the hot tub now by the way if you guys have the opportunity to get a hot tub I would HIGHLY highly suggest it it's better than any Mario Cart it's the best shit you can fucking get and I again like I held off on getting a hot tub for many years just like oh yeah I don't know it seems like a lot of work it's expensive and they have these like soft tubs that were like you know like five grand but now they have a new one out relatively recent and it's called the Intex hot tub int e^x and you want to get the six person one and these are like 500 bucks on Amazon right the up keeps minimal you learned the chemical is very you know it's confusing at first you'll learn it and again I figured the chemicals would kill the fucking sperm from this guy's fuckin germs and shit so regardless so this goes like yeah fucking hot tub and I'm like alright let's go and then as I go to leave to the van I'm like wait a minute I can't take her to the van because then she's gonna be like what's this van I just had sex in here with some random dude right like what the what the fuck is this like what is going on like this is your van I fucked another guy in here like five minutes ago and so I'm like oh wait a minute why don't you guys take an uber to my house and I gotta handle some things I'll be right behind you and they're like she's like what but the other girls like yeah yeah it's awesome so they get in there over they go I don't like dude okay I'm gonna take the van to my suit and then I'm like I'm taking the van do a quickie debrief with these guys I'll do a more thorough one of them tomorrow when we meet up so he's like you can't go to the van like why it's like the other students fucking in there now too and I was like what the that had never happened before in the history of boot camps like where two students fucked in the van on the same night never happened before I'm like well that's another novel experience right at age 42 so I'm like this is fucking awesome dude this is fucking awesome and I'm like alright well at least I'll just leave it here and I'll get it later I gotta at least get my computer out of there like my laptop's as I was throwing some videos and stuff but you know I'll just go get I'll grab that like discreetly and then come out so I go to the van I'm like knock knock and I look at no one's in there like he's still like in the process of pulling her I guess so I go and I get it out and then I look in there and I'm expecting it to be it like all tossed shit right but it's not tossed it's like neater cleaner than it was before it's like housekeeping I came and my fucking tuck like tuck to the bed and and shit like I'm like what the fuck like holy shit and later I asked the student I was like I saw you cleaned up in there after that was pretty nice man he's like yeah I wanted to you know be respectful respect of being so to speak and I was like yeah cool what do you do with the condom did you just like toss it in the fucking gutter I didn't see it there either cuz that's what I usually do I usually just like toss it in the fucking gutter because you know I pay so much in street cleaning tickets these motherfuckers are gonna earn their keep you understand these fucking city official here to clean that shit so but he's like no no I didn't I'm like what did you do he's like I took the condom and I placed it in my pockets and I took it back into the club and then put it in the rubbish bin and I'm like hold on let me get this straight so you were walking through the club with a tiny bag of your own semen in your pocket and he's like yes I well--that's you're a better man than I am okay so that's that's fucking great man so so anyway so I take the uber and I actually I go I go to my house and they're there and so we go into the hot tub and it's fucking on like it is just fucking on and by the way just a couple like tips on the hots of like the hot tub sex is amazing and I know a lot of people they don't like to fuck in the water or you know one person said it was like put trying to put your hand in a wet glove okay you know if it doesn't fit you must have quit or whatever the fuck but you know like I haven't had any problems with it and if you just like you know fuck it if you're like erect enough it's no problem by the way is side note doesn't mean if you got have any of you guys been going to like the day pool parties here or just night yeah I understand I get it okay like you know when you're my age you can you come to Vegas you can either do day or night you can't do both unless you're 20 years old or on cocaine or both so I yeah you're all in the night thing but a lot of my friends like to go to the day parties because they can fuck in the pool without a condom right and a funny side note that one of my friends who was an extra structure this guy Ryan he told me story one time he was at like wet Republic or something and he was talking to this girl in the pool and he's talking to her for like 30 minutes and then she said hey I got to get out real quick I gotta go pee he's like just piss in the pool and she's like that's gross he's like what are you talking about I've been pissing on you for the last 30 minutes she's like but anyway the thing is like the great here's the great thing about the hot tub when you're fucking in the hot tub it's like zero gravity because there's buoyancy right so if you're in a threesome you can do like these fucking moves and shit that you could never do and it was the hottest fucking shit ever I was like holy fuck dude this is fucking crazy like the only drawback is you could drown like like several times I was like going under there's like 40 D's in my face and like I'm like going on her and shit and like the girls like shrieking dude she was like fucking like like top of the lungs and the hot tubs in my backyard okay and so I'm like fuck and it's like 2:00 in the morning you know by this point and I'm like fuck the neighbors dude you know cuz I'm not like some like rural area I'm like right up in like I have neighbors on all sides and I'm like dude the fucking neighbors dude because she's like yelling dude like I look like some kind of pornography and like even my roommates the next day they're like yeah dude we all woke up like we all fucking woke up and I thought for sure what if I was like my roommate Megan she's like I thought for sure that the neighbors were gonna come out and yell at you but then I thought about it and I was thinking that too but I thought about it I'm like I wouldn't even come I'd be - it's so awkward it's like are you gonna be like I like even me and I'm a pretty like assertive person I'd probably be like I hope they stop soon you know what I mean like it's just so fucking weird and awkward you know what I mean but but the but really the best part is like I remember like dude you know they say when you die your life flashes before your eyes right that's definitely on the fucking highlight reel that hot tub threesome definitely on the fucking highlight reel it's gonna flash like it's definitely top 10 sexual experience of my fucking life and my favorite part that I remember and at one point I'm like standing up in the hot tub and like it comes up to about here and these these two girls are sucking my dick and like licking my balls in the hot tub and I'm like this and like and like the steam is coming off of me like like steam is like wafting off of me and I remember thinking I am Gandalf like I don't know why I don't know why Gandalf but that's what came to my mic I am Gandalf but I don't fucking know why so then we so then we went upstairs to finish it off because like again yeah you're floating and stuff and it's great it's not like okay now I can get more leverage upstairs and stuff like that so I go upstairs and we finish it off and it was like totally crazy up there too and like at one point the girls like digging like the girl that um that's my Park my hunting partner whatever she like looks into the my side thing for like Lube or something and she sees like a little butt plug in there so she takes it she like shoves it in the girl's ass out my fucking this girl I put his butt plug up her ass and fuck she's like shrieky more and more so whatever long story short it ends everyone's happy she's like I've never done something like this before I'm like damn this girl had quite a wild night hasn't she he's like fucking a van threesome ADAAA butt plug of brass and then she and then she leaves and I realized after she leaves she stole the butt plug by taking it out in her ass I'm like what the fuck why why would you steal this and that had sentimental value to so you know it was fucked up  and I asked my buddy Kyle my assistant he's in the Marines and we were talking the other day about something called Stolen Valor you ever heard of this you know what that is we're like you see someone out who's like pretending to be in the military like wearing like a uniform and like those videos of like people calling him out and shit so I said to Kyle I'm like is this does this constitute stolen valor Kyle and he's like no she earned it and she did she definitely fucking earned it but I tell that story a lot of people ask me well Jeff why do you have a butt plug in your fucking side drawer well I said it had sentimental value it's kind of an interesting story I had this roommate this this female roommate and she was her birthday it was like two days after mine so one day I'm upstairs eating breakfast and she comes up she's like Jack do you want to have a birthday party our birthdays are so close together like yeah sure love a birthday party it's fine it's like okay well you have to plan it cuz I'm on klonopin and just goes downstairs and I'm like did I just get suckered into planning my own fucking birthday party I guess I did like I'm a man I don't do you guys do it like Oh birthday party we don't do that shit it's kind of like a girl thing not to generalize so I sit down with my friend JJ at the bar later I'm like yo man I got planned this birthday party like I think there should be like a theme I'm like what should the theme be and JD's like butt plugs I'm like oh because he likes that's his kind of thing he likes to put plugs and girls ask he has like these tail ones and all these weird blood plugs I might find butt plugs okay but you know it's got to be something else how about mini-golf and blood plugs and so that's what we decided to do I went on Amazon and I look for the cheapest butt plugs that you could find and so I found these and as you know I am a Capricorn so garnet is my birthstone so I made I made it my birthstone color if you look here seven cents a gram and I didn't know they sold butt plugs by the fucking ground but but they do and it's from China and I was like well maybe it's gonna snap off in someone's ass or something I don't know so I got a shit ton of them I got I got 13 of these mukluks and I put them on little strings so it's like a pendant and then for the birthday party we sent up these invites and the invite was this white girl and putt plugs cash prize for the winner and you see it's a it's a snowman made out of golf balls hitting a golf ball off a butt plug so this was sent out golf attire requested so the cash prize idea was this I offered $1,000 whoever wins the mini golf I will give you $1,000 however to be eligible you must play the mini golf with the butt plug in your asshole the entire time and I have to have photographic proof so I'm like no one's gonna fucking do this right well evidently $1,000 is a powerful motivator because every woman at that fucking part put the butt plugs up their fucking ass all right and with pictures of it and shit and then you know what the best part is I won the fucking golf so I didn't have to pay anyone  I think you know it's a funny story it's a crazy story and it's like it just goes to show that shit never ends and you can always take it to the next level and have a new experience and a fun experience but before that happened and that all went down like you know it's the at the beginning of the story it was probably about like 12:30 at night and we had got to the club at like 10:00 you know 9:30 10:00 so up to that point it was just an average night you know I talked to a couple girls and they were like yeah whatever you know in fact I talked to one girl in there I stepped it actually the hottest girl in the club I thought and she thought I was a fucking idiot she's like this guy's crazy maybe she's right you know like I'm dressed like a lunatic I got this wolf shirt on these creepy glasses a Members Only jacket fingerless gloves three people asked me for cocaine that night I'm like why do people keep fucking asked me for cocaine and like what the one guy's like look how you're dressed man like okay fair point you know but it was just kind of a shitty night and then all of a sudden boom you know what I mean and that's one of the favorite my favorite aspects of game you know it only takes one set it only takes one good set to turn your whole night around you could be going up to girls it's like man black no thank you nice to meet you have a boyfriend whatever and then you just meet that one and it's like this epic story that is gonna be on the highlight reel of your life flashing before your eyes when you die so play is to the end play it to the fucking end every night that's part of the adventure you never know which one's gonna pull he'll be the first girl you talk to it as soon as you step into the club it could be the last when you talk to as you're like right about to get into the uber to go home you never fucking know look at this how is he communicating how's it communicating her friend to a friend friend to a friend buddy buddy buddy  sometimes our man to a woman gentlemen you know why we left do you know why we're leaving what because you failed there what is your criteria for success  approach show intent and Express from the core you know what you're not you're you're approaching but you're not showing any intent you're approaching like little boys this is a man's game bitch you have so much potential as soon as I walked in there I was like oh these guys are gonna own he's gonna own look at him they look cool this guy's got an Australian accent Jesus Christ what more do you need but what are you doing what are you doing you're twiddling your thumbs come on man let's all step the fuck up what are you afraid of  make out make out you're doing really good make out now  yeah  cool  so it's time for the students of bowl we're gonna have them say have you ever seen the hotel blank and that's the most amazing views of the city you've got to see this I want to show you my favorite place  is that guy tried am I try again  bye-bye in the night another RSD success story started out tonight very pussy you approached show intent and express from the core he wasn't even getting blown out so i was like failure you got to get the fuck out here come to the next place i purge starts showing intent like doesn't it feel better to get blown out yeah it does feel better well guess what sure enough now he doesn't get blown out that goes pretty cute I told him to pull and he was like I tried I go try again hahaha and the next thing you know out the door see persistence for the win and love I'm so fucking happy about this dude  you [Music]",ifyY1DS82d4
yo wassup this your boy Jeffy a que Donald Trump jr. ek trillionaire Jesus and I'm here today in San Fran motherfucking Cisco California with a very important message about your life and love some really important lessons and what in particular am i speaking of well I'm speaking about the phenomenon of beginning with the end in mind now what does it mean to begin with the end in mind all right what it means quite simply is that when you're trying to accomplish something in this case what we're talking about these picking up girls in a cold approach pickup situation you need to start at the end the conclusion of what you want to accomplish what is your end goal and work backwards from there okay so obviously what's the end goal that we're talking about here well most likely if you're a red-blooded American male or any nationality male for that matter who's heterosexual you want to fuck the girl okay you want to engage in sexual intercourse with the lady at the end of the interaction okay great so many guys however do not do this many many guys actually fail to begin with the end in mind and let me give you a couple examples of what I'm talking about here because this is one of those things that I find is incredibly infuriating when I see it happening I have one of my assistants and the other night he said to me hey Jeff are we going to go beasting later and I was like yeah but don't you have a day - don't you have a date later because he had told me yet set up a date and he's like yeah but I set the date up early so we can go out and beast after okay you know what I looked at him like I was like this  what like what what why would you be beasting after why the fuck would you be beasting after it's like well you know I figure I go on the day I fish and then we go beasting after okay let me tell you some motherfuckers if we go on if I go on a fucking date there will be no bee sting after okay do you want to know why there's gonna be no bee sting after well because after the date I'm to be having sex with her repeatedly you know what the beestings is going to consist of the beastie is going to consider me ejaculating honor that's gonna be the fucking so-called beasting after okay but in his mind he set himself up for failure because he thinks I'll go on this date it you know probably won't result in sex and then I'll just go beast later right so his entire mentality is fucked his entire mentality is fucked so it's an internal mental shift and this is a guy who watches tons of Theory video in fact it's he's my one of my roommates and I'll like walk to the bathroom in the morning and I'll hear like tiling yeah yeah time a trial here like Julian everything doo-doo-doo I'll even hear my own voice which is the curt one of the creepiest shits ever right I'm like close the door I don't want to listen to my own voice like yelling about pickup but in any case he's theory up the ass he's got so much theory up his ass that it's coming out of his mouth and nose and other orifices however you get about theory in the world but until you make that internal mental shift that I pull fucking ass this is what happens you know you're going to be you're going to be dicking around like this shit doing these these idiotic moves let me give you an another example same guy sets up a date and I'm like also where's your date tonight where you where you going he's like well I'm setting up the date in North Beach you you what mate it's over for annoyed why why okay and for those who don't know what you don't um North Beach is about you know a 20-minute drive across the city I'm like why don't you just do the shithole by the by the house that fucking shit hold the fucking pops by hell what are you setting up there it's two blocks right and I said why and you know what he does he does sit there in silence we're in the car and he sits there in silence and I go that was not a rhetorical question I actually want to know what's your thought process on this like why why so he's like well you know the bar is fun too digital Mike who gives a shit that's not important you know it's important the end of the night you know what's important the other night the fucking pole you want to get the fucking pulp done properly so let's see what's going to be superior for that having to pull the girl literally across the entire city to the house like some 20 minute drive or a two minute walk to the fucking house she's like well I just thought that and he literally cannot even come up with a coherent answer for it he can't I'm like why why why this I'm not I'd want to know why I want to know what he's like oh I don't know he literally doesn't know this is under stupid person either this is a guy who has an advanced degree in chemistry from a well-respected university okay and I'm like how the fuck do you even graduate school motherfucker you know but the thing is it's not a question of intelligence it's a question of internally he doesn't believe that he's going to pull right so he's not thinking about these things and and I'm like you've got to make that shift where you're thinking start at the end and work your way backwards okay so that's very very important now the second thing I want to talk about here is a related phenomenon and that's the whole idea of letting good enough be good enough and this is kind of related to quote-unquote beginning with the end in mind because it it's symptomatic of a guy who doesn't he's not it doesn't have his eyes on the prize of getting laid he's more focused on theory he's more focused on how things are supposed to go how a pickup is supposed to go and going back to my example of my friend who's this massive theory guy right he will sit in his room he'll listen to several hours of pickup theory today and then when he goes out often times I'll see he'll have in the field he'll have situations where he looks like it's an easy layup or like a slam dunk right but then he doesn't pull the girl I'm like why not he'll be like well it didn't seem like she was ready for it because of the Iowas or some bullshit like some Theory bullshit that is in direct contradiction to what he was seeing before his eyes in real life where which is what a girl who is DTF who wants to go home with him but because either you know she's not getting overt signals of attraction which happens quite a bit you know the girl as long as she's standing there listening your bullshit my opinion it's on you know to an extent but um you know but um but anyway you know he thinks that he has to go through all the steps of a perfect pickup before he can actually give himself permission to pull so to speak and the thing is sometimes you just gotta let good enough be good enough it doesn't matter if you did the fucking tap dancing on the moon with all the fucking phases and overwhelming you know to overcome the peer group and handled just perfectly did it uh all that matters is you try for the fucking pull man and you see if it goes down you see if it fucking goes down and if it doesn't you back the fuck up and try again you know hear that all four times rule if you must you want to be just a sociopath banging his head against a wall but if you know and spend your time wisely in field but at the same time give yourself permission to pull even if you're not executing all the steps absolutely perfectly oh yeah let good enough be good enough okay so you may have noticed I've got a max of wild max has appeared next to me and um he's going to now use demagoguery and it's super super effective what are your thoughts on these kind of these topics here ah yeah I mean I mean have plenty of stories of bootcamp students most of my self fucking out because it's not perfect I remember specifically it was actually New York and it wasn't like extremely good-looking very James Bondish kind of guy and do you hear a really good game like all the girls loved him and then I remember I would pull with him I would pull the two sets with him and then the girls were like we were like eggs egg honey sound like bringing them out of the club all the way to the cab but then the girls were oh wait our friends over at that bar let's go say hi to him real quick and I'm like okay awesome let's do it right from you is just like a little obstacle in there no problem and I shit you not the student would turn around and be like okay max it was nice to meet you that was in this was in New York actually we did it together yeah and he's like well guess I'm going back to Jeffrey nice to meet you max and I'm like what the fuck like what the fuck are you doing and I took him to the side and I asked him you know how he's pulled so far looked like because according to him he pulled quite a lot of times he's like well I meet the girl she's super down and then she begs me to come with me and I'm like that's awesome when that happens like it happens to me like maybe like a dozen times a year but fair amount because we go out all exactly but the normal pole is the girl at least gives you at some point a little shit or if you are a weird short Austrian she gives you a lot of shit especially in the beginning and I'm like dude that that pole we were about to do was actually very smooth and just because the girl's hair gave us a little obstacle and he literally he's like really do you think the girl actually like me I'm like dude or fucking course and you know a big thing that I see most of the time is the approach and quite frankly there's barely ever an approach that is smooth to where you're oh hey you nice to meet you and the girl sir oh yeah what's her name it's always fucking bumpiest fuck to something I teach I was like embrace the awkwardness especially at the approach but embrace the awkward awkward is also at the pole and whatever and a big thing I usually teach on programs is I let the students go back into sets that are quote unquote dead is something you do as well is like go back into the set go back into the set now this is not because we're dicks I mean maybe a little bit but it's mainly because we want the students to get like a certain threshold of like how okay are they with an uncomfortable situation because quite frankly the more you're willing to endure awkward nurse and uncomfortableness in your own skin the more you will actually get laid I had I fucked tons of experiences where I just like did my ground like stayed and said doesn't matter even if it's fucking weird and then I actually did get laid now the difference is for guys like us we have the reference experience that tells us ok uncomfortableness can and will result in sex you don't have that but you can virtually create that in your mind and say ok if it actually happened so many times for others there's no reason why it won't happen for me and that way you can let good enough be good enough without having to perfection eyes your game at all costs and you know I'm not adding on to what you said there when we send these students in to set over and over a lot of times the guy said well I got blown out massively hard my Duke they don't even fucking remember yeah and they literally don't I remember recently I was in Edmonton and I had sent this student in a couple times the girl wouldn't already went to send him in again he got blown it again so then we're at the diner after at the kebab shop and with the up the other student pulls those girls in and so I call him over and we're sitting down and I asked I tell one of the girls Mike if I asked you the prom would you go with me and she's like that's so weird some guy earlier tonight said that same thing to me and he was super fucking creepy Oh God did it and she does not realize the guy that said that is sitting next to her and has been talking to her and she literally doesn't even realize it they don't even remember to such a disassociated environment you know and so so again the girls again they're not really thinking like is this guy's game perfect da da da da and what's in the main thing actually that enables you to not have heard the game and still get laid well it's as the great philosopher from the a 20th century Cindy Lauper said girls just want to have fun like ultimate at the end of the day they want to get laid just much guys and they're willing to tolerate a little bit of fuck you know bumpy ride and in fact will even give you a bumpy ride to see how you're gonna tolerate it yourself and at the end of the day again they're just there have fun and you should be there have fun too so again begin with the end in mind work backwards they're delayed and then be willing to let go and just let good enough be good and most importantly have fun out there it's been Jeffy and Max and we'll see you next time on our station  I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see yes hot girls you just want to get laid are actively trying to do so online over the past three years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that lets me nitpick the hot girls on any dating site completely automate the process and get me dates left and right anywhere these changes can make all the difference in you getting laid from a girl you met online or getting dick it's simple once you know what to do this system has gotten me laid with literally hundreds of women I met on dating sites and apps and it doesn't waste my fucking time this is the program the ruthlessly efficient repeatable system for the modern day online gangster and it's designed to get you laid period it's over 14 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with infield footage broken down case studies and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you Pollard that night I cover everything from bad photos to horrible photos to what you should look like and how to make your pigs awesome how to talk to a girl who meets a potentially insane person off the internet let me but fuck you and how to get her to actually like you enough to be excited to go out my god you are fucking hilarious and if she's the ice queen from the lands of frozen well I know how to turn that around too sorry I covered the exact and repeatable pattern it takes to take a girl home nearly eighty five percent of the time she agrees to meet up this is my online masterpiece and if you know me know I over deliver I keep it real with over fifty real-life case studies and hours of infield date footage with my live break from the textbook date to the bitchy girl to the awkward girl to the princess to the friendzone you'll see them all the program has taken over ten years of non-stop refinement and bottom line it just plain works now you have a choice to keep using the Internet to beat off to it or use it to have someone else beat it off for you so decide how fast you want to start getting laid and execute the program  you  you,j2aS5z6qsLc
yo yo what up kitty is welcome to the next edition of the Jeffy YouTube hour I'm joined as always by my co-host Saddam Hussein who is today having one glove like Michael Jackson holding gat and he has a superpower his head light sweet so Saddam when he just kick it over there you're kind of the epoch man you're kind of my my Andy to my Conan sit him right there but let's crack right into it gonna be a quick one today I wanted to answer one question in one question alone the other day I was actually at a free tour and some guy came up to me after the tour and there's a former student mine actually and you know he said he had been doing pretty good you know with his whole pickup journey and so forth since the boot camp however he said that he was feeling a little like he's being pulled in different directions because you he's being pulled in some nude directions just to touch on some old and I'll be there for you but in any case what he meant was this he had some business opportunities that he wanted to pursue and however these business opportunities were gonna take up a lot of his time right he required a lot of studying and research and and learning and then spending a massive amount of hours to get it done and which would mean for you know about a year close to a year he wouldn't be able to go out and continue to do pick up cold approach makeup to practice so his concern was that during this time his skills with atrophy and when he got back into the game after this endeavor was finished he would kind of back at square one and so it was very very concerned that he'd you know it was a user or lose it situation so he said what is your experience with this now I gotta tell you I've had many many situations many periods of time where I had to put my focus elsewhere right where I didn't go out when I first got into pickup I was completely obsessed with it after my first couple like nascent successes after the first time I got laid off of a cold approach you know I've been a stranger at a party and you know hooked up with her a couple days later I got her phone over hook up to where they're hooked up with her a couple days later then you know we and I walked out of that girl's house like I was walking on sunshine because I was like this is real this stuff works ha ha ha right so I was like holy shit I started doing it every day and for the next couple years I went out practically every night you know and you know I've paid my fucking dudes I've been a 15-year veteran of the game at this point - Dave's stent where I don't even necessarily need to warm up you know I don't even like to get to the club at 10 o'clock right back in the day I'd get their design you need warmup now I don't even liked it because I know you you know most likely you're not gonna pull in the first two hours because the girls just got there you know they spent 90 minutes getting ready they have to find a place at the bar they meet up there with friends they find out where they're sitting in the club they hug each other they have their first couple drinks and then you come up five minutes later and you're like Holly she's not gonna be like okay later friends I'm gonna go suck this guy's dick stranger things have happened absolutely but it's fairly unlikely so this is one of the reasons that we have what we call the two hour rule which is that the mentality when you first go into the club the first two hours kind of don't count so it allows you to relax into the night right and get a head of steam going however like I was just saying I after 15 years I can literally just show up to the club at midnight and boom bounce right into it you know hit hit the ground running almost a full full steam I go from 0 to 100 very quickly these days but I paid dearly for that shit right blood sweat and tears so what's the point ok there is a point and I'm kind of looping around to it here is this after all that effort after all that time like I said there's have been some times where I have had to put my focus on sports for example when I was working on execute the program when I was working on execute the program I basically kind of stopped doing cold approach Club game for like a couple years in fact I mean of course I was going on in the weekends boot camp and helping students so I always had one foot in that world but in terms of me going out like goin hot goin fuckin beast mode and like goin super hard trying to get laid for my own personal gain every night I was like nope we're gonna we're gonna focus in and we're gonna get the science of this tinder shit down and of course I did that but then last year Tyler asked me it wasn't really a question it was more of a a command from on high he's like you got to do another boot camp or another hot seat rather and I was pretty nervous cuz I'd been doing you know online almost exclusively for a while I was like shit man am I gonna be able to do this I'm 40 now you know can I even keep up with these youngsters these young guns you know Julian and Max that are putting out amazing content and I was nervous you know when maybe I'd lost the mojo a bit and I gotta tell you I went out there and it was awkward for like the first week but then boom it came rushing back like a tsunami this truly is like riding a bike these skills these social skills that you get when you're learning this stuff they will always stick with you and that's the good news that's what I told this guy the at the free tour I told them you know the game will always be a home for you and you can step right back into it like it like an old familiar coat you know and it's it's really it's a it's a wonderful thing it's a wonderful thing however having said that there will be typically about a week or maybe even a couple weeks of what what that MMA people the fighters call ring rust you know when you haven't been in the ring for a while and you're kind of rusty so you got to shake the rust off and what that means is you're going to experience your skills aren't gonna be at the top that that exact that's sharp fucking crispy hitting level that they were when you were going out all the time and what that means is you will make slight mechanical errors at the beginning because you're just remembering you know yeah right that that that so example this would be a couple weeks ago I was out at the park and dude stop saving lives I don't wanna hear that shit emergency services so but anyway so I was out at the park and I had been hurt I was like a pinch pinch of nerve in my neck actually doing the transformational exercises and had seen hints in Seattle and I was like so I was like kind of light like lot no laid up for a few weeks and then so I went to the park with my roommate and my homey and we're just hang out on the park and some little 20-year old girls walked by and I holler him down like hey hey come here you oh you guys have papers for weed I'm like yeah of course I totally didn't look yeah here's your one a beer did it set him down the on the blanket so our game in a rub and the chicks super enemies okay what do you what's the point here so her friend isn't into it right she's like why is she talking about man but she was super into it so the friends like we got to go we got to go to fun or other friends but she's like oh she's like shit I want to go to karaoke with you later cuz I had mentioned that so she's like let me let me get your number and I'll call you I'll call you up for karaoke after this in a couple hours right and so what I do I'm like yeah absolutely I gave her my number doesn't that actually entered it in and if she fucked off so what do you think happened I'll tell you what happened I never saw her again and I she never texted me why because what should I have done there I should have exchanged numbers or I should have put my number in her phone and then called mine I should have got her number etc etc etc why didn't I cuz it slipped my mind that's the ring rust right that's what being rusty looks like in practical terms I again you're gonna make tiny little procedural mechanical errors but again you only need to make those like one time where you're like oh shit right that that that so again shaking off that rust is a product's gonna be a process of making those little errors and remembering the basics until you're like oh yeah yeah and it all comes back to you and then you have it all your fingertips again so if you got to take a hiatus from the game for a little bit absolutely fine remember there are many many aspects to your life that you need to balance in order to be completely healthy to have like the best experience right and I believe Tony Robbins said you should think of your life like a wheel alright you're at the middle and then the spokes come out and they're different things they're like you know romantic relationships your fitness your money your emotional health data to the data and think of it like again think of it like spokes coming out from the hub and if what if certain if the spokes aren't all the same link like say one of them later you know your your game ones really high but then like your finances shit and then your fitness is shit it's gonna be that wheel it's gonna be lumpy so it might go at slowest speeds like boom boom badoom but I think it's going high it's getting boom oh just fucking rip the wheel off the absol so balance is very important it's a it's an often overlooked part of this game you know it can be useful to go hard at certain things for periods of time but overall you want to look at the big picture right and and and strive for that balance but it can be useful and necessary at times to immerse yourself very you know very deeply in one subject or area for a while to accomplish something to push through a plateau etc etc but always bear in mind the overall balance the overall holistic balance if you will of your lives right but if you've got to take that break like I said it's comforting to know that the game will always be a home for me and you as well so anyway this is Jeffy and Saddam signing off and I'll see you next time of the Jeffy YouTube channel extravaganza  you,jQ2QnrouP2E
welcome to day four of the resonator extravaganza on the first day we discussed why fixing your vocal projection is so fundamental with the success with women and after that I showed you how resonator explains exactly how the vocal apparatus works with simple exercises that anybody can engage with daily to master healthy strong and pleasant vocal projection yesterday we went over the nuances of emotional variants frame control and tonality that women find attractive and today we're taking things to the next one now the vocal segments of resonator would certainly be more than enough to solve most guys issues in this area very quickly but after some thought we decided that vocal projection would just be the base level of this program why well talking with Owen he reminded me like Jeff you've always been great at storytelling you've always been great at humor and so we realized that those concepts build nicely upon the foundation of vocal projection that we already established with resonator so look if it's a question as old as the game itself guys always ask me how do I keep talking without running out of things to say very common question now the solution is what pimps call the million dollar mouthpiece and it's one of the most powerful tools and any guys Arsenal when you're out meeting women the ability to just talk talk talk talk talk and never run out of things to say so if this is something that you've struggled with it's more likely that you it's because you're not approaching this problem correctly in your mind in the first place and with these additional modules that I've added two resonator the way that you view this part of the game is going to be changed forever alright now first we get into what's called the grammar of storytelling and in this segment I talked about the secret language the secret rules of storytelling that make all the difference between girls finding your stories and you know by extension your dick interesting and compelling or boring and dull and witness knowledge you're going to be able to craft masterful tales spin yarns out of thin air you're going to have her literally hanging under every word and ignoring every other dude if you see my hot seat you know when I go into the set it's like BAM all eyes are on me the girls will immediately snap to attention and they're like okay I want to hear what this motherfucker has to say powerful stories are always waiting to be born but they've also got to be perfected so after you watch this section you're and understand that process again like I said you're going to be able to spin gold out of even the most boring material on the fly so let's check out a clip now when we talk about telling a story we're not necessarily talking about like it was a dark and stormy night once upon a time etc etc but you know when you're speaking and you're talking or you're conveying different things you might even say things you've said before maybe you're bringing up anecdotes from the past and so there's a variety again like I said it the preacher there's a there's a grammar to storytelling there's a set of rules that sort of govern it that if you adhere to you're going to become a much much better storyteller okay and it's gonna be a lot more compelling and people are going to listen to you and people going to be hanging on the words and want to hear what you're going to say next so what is the number one rule of storytelling well it goes back to the number one rule of pickup which is what whatever you feel they feel so you want to again approach it from an emotional standpoint you don't want to approach from a logical standpoint that's again the one of the biggest things I see in pickups is you know a lot of guys they either have a very logical job or there's very logical people in general and they think shit needs to make sense and so on and so forth so I want to move her emotionally not logically okay I want to change her mood not her mind so look at me man I'm a very average person like in other words I'm just like some average little white guy you know Durer Here I am like there are a million guys that can outclass me in terms of just like attractiveness value things of that nature but why do I have more success than a lot of those guys well because I move them on an emotional level I have the ability to move them and give them and share an emotional experience with them so what stories do is they're putting facts into an emotional context right you're putting facts into an emotional context the information doesn't just sit there like it would in like a list you know what I mean like it Orion like a like a logical proposition like a business proposition it's designed to create what  well suspense like what's he going to say next what's he gonna say next they they want to hear what's going to come next so with a story like by the way so one of my friends that was working on that introduced me actually just Susan this guy he's also a professional singer but he does on the side he does magic right he's a corporate magician so that he's hired to go to these events you know like some of these cocktail you know events for corporations and he walks around doing magic so for him to connect with these people what does he have to do well he developed what's called pattern and what the patter does though it's interesting because it has a dual effect not only is it there to just again you know so he's actually talking what's the other effect of the pattern mm-hmm what do you say say it again distract distract them from what imagine what see where he's actually doing the trick now again we're not trying to like distract people here necessarily and they trick them okay but people make decisions emotionally and then what they do is they will backwards rationalize an intellectual reason for it so this is why a lot of times when you do a pull and you're actually doing the poll you don't want her to be thinking like oh shit I'm leaving with this dude this is a bit untoward I've never done something of this nature before what would my friends think what would they say at work dah dah dah dah dah you don't want their mind going there you want their mind going where I'll just focus on the present just being present focusing on the fun and you know keeping it light-hearted and stuff like that so this is why when I'm doing a poll I'm just like banter banter banter banter banter banter banter again people make decisions emotionally and then they backwards rationalize with the intellect emotion and vibe is the primary key to all this here okay to the storytelling wherever it's not the content it's the vibe that attracts them you've really gotta like internalize that you really really got to internalize that when I'm talking most of the time I'm not thinking of what to say at all I do have certain like lines I deploy for certain for certain situations I guess also when I when I'm dropping my flirtatious like statements of intent and stuff a lot of those are very canned because I know that they're they're almost like jokes you know so then we'll talk about that in a second as well but you can't be talking at them you know like when I'm when I'm here I'm at free tour or I'm at my hot seat or whatever I don't want to be talking at you guys I want to be talking with you guys because it makes an emotional connection if I'm just here like sitting here like reciting like like directly reciting these notes to you it's not going to be as impactful you need to lead the conversation obviously however you talk to them you need the in charge of the conversation you know she starts I mean yes it's interactive but if she's like oh let's talk about the war in Syria let's talk about politics let's talk about my religion let's talk about my grandma's cancer I'm going to like change the fucking subject immediately because I do not want to go down those roads but at the same time it is a conversation I'm in charge I'm not generally steering it but it is a two-way street that's why I contact is so important the number one thing that I teach my students like the first thing the first thing above allwhy get boot camp students I'm like I want you making eye contact with every single girl you in Iraq with tonight I want to standing in front of them and I want you making eye contact so for example if I'm standing like this I'm talking to you like this this is not squared up right so feel the distinction like there's a small just it's a subtle distinction but the distinction between this and this right it's like subtle but you feel and I'm like more present with you you know what I mean so it's very very important and you can communicate a lot with your eyes a lot good-evening on the next idiot of the night why is that such a powerful opener all right don't wear ironic self oh right there that's what it is hear what he said set up that because it's spoken to a lot of idiots yeah because you literally are the next idiot of the night so it's demonstrating a meta awareness of the situation and further it's you have a demonstrable attunement to her subjective experience it's like I get it I get it right it's like okay this guy's different it's different he gets it right good evening I'm Chinese and I love balls right that's different what's more likely to work good evening ma'am my name is Jeff hi my name is Jeff I'm I just wanted to say hi to you I'm an author I've traveled the world I'm doing pretty well professionally my friends and I we formed a niche industry out of whole cloth about 15 years ago we worked very hard and and you know we're relatively successful now and we're hoping to do great things and and help a lot of people and I'd love for you to be a part of that and you know maybe I'd like to explore the possibility of us being together romantically what's more likely to work that or I'm Chinese I love balls I'm Chinese I love balls because why it's not putting pressure on her and it's fucking different just be different again what's another thing I'm saying I'll be like good evening allow me to introduce myself my name is Satan I'm a professional mermaid like what it doesn't even make sense now granted you can't just do a lot log on to that like oh just say gibberish the whole time like I said before you do need to kind of temper this with keeping it real like you've got a certain point take the mask off me like yeah I'm real but again most guys they can't even do the absurdity right so and again that's a pendulum you got experiment with it and then find that sweet spot learn to know when to turn that off and go real to build trust you know to not break trust rather even who can tell me what's like the basic most fundamental structure of a story  and and yes so again it's got that element and it's got the beginning the middle the end so generally there's going to be some sort of challenge issue tension and then there's going to be a struggle in the middle and then there's going to be some kind of resolution right and generally again Eve's like even that dump sorry I told about the trash what's the challenge the trash isn't taken out what's the struggle I pull the trash out what's the resolution the trash is out again like don't don't overthink it but really well you threaded you create a little little sign sores yeah yeah and then you can create a little side stories and loops and things of that nature right so but the best stories they lead with the heart they don't lead with the mind you know it's not like a logical like I said in the beginning it's not like a logical dissemination of information when you do it like that even if the story itself is actually really good if you tell it like that it's it's almost like watching a movie that's got really good special effects that the writing's terrible it's like okay you know it's kind of person but there's no heart to it it doesn't can you know connect the next module I added is the mastery of humor one comment I hear all the time is that I you know Jeff you should quit pickup and you should become a stand-up comedian okay you can do this you can be a comedian and look it's not it's true okay when I'm on stage where I'm in set more often than not the people I'm talking to are actually laughing and they're having a good time look everybody enjoys laughing alright so sort of by definition it's a physical expression of pleasure it's there's a physical expression of euphoria and if you can get the girls to associate that feeling with you you're in it's a done deal however I didn't start out with the ability to make people laugh consistently okay it was something that I had to cultivate over time and I did so by learning the rules that govern humor and the rules that govern what makes something funny if you have any professional comedian they'll tell you comedy is a craft louis c.k and his recent special he said something along the lines of you know I had to work for this I've been doing this for 35 years and I've only been good at it for like the last five so I don't say that to get you worried that you're going to have to practice for three decades before you can get laid okay obviously we're not attempting to go professional with our humor but learning how to improve your sense of humor enough so that you stand out from the other boring guys that isn't hard at all once you know what to do so in this module I talk about the different types of humor and how to find the one that resonates most with your own personality which is very very important I also give you a variety of exercises to help you practice and hone your comedy skills and also to help you loosen up and let go when you hit the club and most importantly I'm going to get dozens and dozens of my personal best jokes and lines that I use in my interactions to move things forward in a fun and cool way while I lead her back to my place for the sexy times.com okay let's check out a quick clip we are going to go now and we're going to talk about the magical mystical salt bay spice that goes on the top of our pyramid which is humor so again vocal projection is the foundation then we've got general storytelling principles and now we're going to get the principles of humor itself I've heard my style of humor kind of described as a witty it right it's a witty in' so it's like an idiot that's witty so witty an idiot with yet so witty 'it's are provided with a different set of expectations than say cool guys or even choads or even players for that matter so when a witty amidst some sort of like faux pas or social error it's almost endearing the witty it can get away with saying almost anything right you see a lot of this kind of just kind of stuff with Julian I've got a lot of this and you know it's not absolutely necessary but it's pretty effective so the main points of witty theorist follows tongue-in-cheek stupidity creatively dumb reinterpretations of things active avoidance of managing people's perceptions of you making yourself laugh above being cool and saying things that don't fully make sense in general but that makes some degree of sense regardless of the context you provide to it so what is this wittiest II demonstrate basically a sense of fucking humor outcome independence not taking yourself seriously an understanding of subtlety and nuances of conversation and a relate ability to people of all levels of intellect right you could talk to a smart person you can talk to a you know a ding dong and finally a non-judgmental attitude so you want to think of it like like jazz jazz music you know you have an understanding of the basic structure of where things are going and a which kind of provides you know the skeleton and that breeds the confidence to then start kind of you know whittling away over the over the top this so-called Vidya see if the pick up the steps of a pick up are always the same pretty much but this so-called witty ously you want to think of it like that oh look it's the kind of guitar solo over it so you got it you got to be aware of the chord progressions you got to know how to do the basics and that's the structure but then you add this stuff on top so let me let me just lay it out for you okay you know even if you have like a funny joke it's all in what the dwell time is important we'll get to that a second but it's all in the delivery okay the best joke the funniest joke in the world in the hands of somebody who's not skilled of delivery it's going to be it's not going to be funny at all it's going to be dumb it's a a groan inducing or a dad joke you know so here's the thing though but aren't of like telling a funny story or like telling a funny joke it can be mastered simply by knowing and applying certain techniques again this is a craft this is why people can get better at comedy and I told this story before you might heard you tell it you know I'm ever back in the day Olin was not funny you know you saw him cracking all these crazy jokes and shit at the free tour the other night he was not funny literally we'd be at a dinner and he'd cracked some fucking dad joke and everyone would be like haha hahaha because it's the boss you know like very funny sir hahahaha and we like groaning internally I rolling it you know each other but then he actually went through he realized this was a deficiency ad so he actually went to improv here in here in Los Angeles it's called the UCB theatre The Upright Citizens Brigade and he took all their levels of The Improv and now he's actually funny you know I'm funnier but you know whenever so that but practically anyone can learn this is comedy is a craft I think that the issue that most people have who aren't funny is they're very serious people you know I mean they just have this form or for whatever reason the level you know the poisons ripping the social conditioning they feel that in order to be taken seriously by people they have to be a serious person in fact I'll even make jokes sometimes with the girl back you know what I think we need to have a serious conversation so you know that I'm a serious person right I like say that it's a joke so but most people they feel like communication is what it's like utilitarian right what is the purpose of language and communication to convey information and that's pretty much it so furthermore a lot of guys who have like jobs that are very logical and we discussed this earlier like you know engineers they kind of get an identity around that they kind of have built up an identity around that and so it becomes so integrated into their personality it's difficult for them to cut loose when they go out at night we've been building the student layers here humor tone of voice is all important right people are going to be responding to tone more than the words and like I said before the funniest joke in the world is not going to be good with with poor delivery so what is delivery how would you define delivery  delivery it's the articulating of words in a convincing and authoritative way a concise way as well concise entertaining authoritative and convincing and someone else mentioned this the other crucial component of humor is what timing so timing and I've defined this as follows the art of delivering words and sentences in a rhythmic or varying tempo with calculated emphasis in order to heighten their effectiveness all right so very often good timing is not so much knowing when to speak but knowing when to pause because the pauses can make an entirely different given entirely different meaning to it so if I say this I went I went horseback riding and with my uncle and then at the end of it I I helped my uncle jack off the horse so if I say that it says one thing but if I say I helped my uncle jack off the horse this is totally different meeting right before I go let me remind you of the sick bonus package that I put together for resonator chock-full of wonderful goodness if you pick up a copy of resonator through the links on the VIP interest list before July 5th you're going

cannot cook the sets that that set 80% of the time this is the problem hey hi freeze motherfucker a good evening he doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him so why the find a function she [Music] this is the roof of the mouth right here okay oh right yes smelling something nice touching the shoulders ah that's the touch down right there I'm not just being loud but being clear so that's right sometimes people will say well what they heard you they heard the noise  good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps and cheese and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding that was good so uncomfortable I'm Jared ah that was nice flinching it here no juice yeah and that's what we don't want ok that's we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow there's to öland this is probably what my boss's cords look like I should be out of the matrix any time what are you fucking talking about oh I'm like literally cringing she was like my voice told us like Oh like average but yours is like amazing [Music] yeah don't do this we'll get sit down shut up blah blah the other B get down here yeah your job yeah yeah oh you're dumb your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a to MIT where we're telling stories you want to be more excited or you need to be more like calm and collected and that will change often dynamically during the interaction itself it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn to stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice you're going to be able to go out and take your finger like this and push it push it and then and that weird and so weird to think when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I truly believe this it's only a matter of time until they like hey now you're addicted I love you my family gave me a huge awareness of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicality behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling and humor put on a person although father like hello LM LM Raj he you know I write that you know some little act and that success mostly quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game concept there's like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the spots to project myself jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve we're so so so long [Music],jbyA5o_trt0
whatup this is Jeff I'm standing outside the quli Gardens here in Copenhagen Denmark and we're about to crack into a quick clip from the Copenhagen free tour that I did last week and it was amazing crowd a lot of guys who had never been to an RC event before so there were a lot of questions that they were kind of fundamental so I'm going to dip into some of those questions as well and furthermore I'm going to talk about some of the concepts that are involved in the upcoming resonator program so hope you enjoy this and by the way if you like this little like online toy that you're going to see us play around with that details the anatomy of the vocal apparatus in real time it's kind of a fun thing on the internet you could Google pink trombone and you could play around with that for yourself anyway resonators coming out June 21st be sure to sign up to the VIP interest list below at rst of resonator comm and as soon as you sign up you get a little bonus you'll get a free

up here was I say the seaside shirt attention whoring yeah that's what I've been known to go through yes no I'm familiar with the turn so my question is how do you do with that or like I usually throw myself off sometime and I'm like I don't want to be the Edition for but then on the face I don't get my attention and then like I feel for you more I would say you got to be the biggest fucking attention whore there is you need to be sucking that fucking attention cock you need to be the biggest attention who are possible  let's do it that's what it is that's what this shit is do you understand you don't look that's what it is right that's what it is go ahead have a seat so so the thing is this look a lot of times like you guys and they come up on the bootcamp and they're like I'm like look you need to go up and they're not they don't have a lot of emotional color so they go up and they're kind of like hey how does it how are you how's it going I would like to you know like and  and I'm like dude I need to see a little variance let's see some like variance and gestures variance in facial expressions variance in tone variance and content right good luck well you know I'd like to but that's just not me just ah me man well too fucking bad that's like you coming to like a boxing gym like I want to learn boxing but you know I really don't want to hit people that's just not me it's like that's what it is motherfucker if you don't like it this might not be the best thing for you now look I get it when I wake up in the morning I look at the mirror and I see there's Jeff I'm brushing my teeth I'm like actually I have an electric toothbrush and so I'm like there's you have a work in progress like everyone else okay needs to them work good in some ways but when I'm out at the club it's it's fucking Jeff fucking Allan bitch you know it's like I'm not like this look we have a narcissistic side we have a humble side we have an irreverent side we have a respectful side so there's certain aspects that are generally generally going to be better for pickup at least in the initial stages when you're trying to capture people's attention so I'd say yeah you've got to practice being on some fucking stage so let's face it when you step up to a group of strangers you're onstage they're like who the hell is this guy okay what do you want what do you want why are you here what the fuck are you doing here why are you talking to me and you need to be able to convey that quickly because if you don't they're going to be like I don't know what this is but it's not helping my night bye and it will be summarily dismissed bye talk to the hand bye Felicia okay or whatever right so you you have to and by the way I've advocated for this kind of stuff mate for many years you know as you probably know I was the san francisco karaoke champion of 2007 no do not clap for that I got articles doing karaoke I would just go up on stage and I loved it because there's mine too of my favorite activity is getting drunk and yelling at strangers and and then then when I learn pickup I'm like well there's girls here I might as well do it here and so that's kind of almost where I cut my teeth but again just being on stage and like learning like again when I'm on the stage whether it's here whether it's the karaoke whether it's interacting with the girl I'm making the decision to engage I'm making a decision to ink it to communicate with you you have to make the decision to communicate with the girl to relate to her so I don't care man and a lot of the times you'll hear me and I'm like if you see my and field like you're like oh shit I heard him say that fucking line a billion times before like I do I have a lot of little lines I use this particularly for the the statements of the tenth the moving it forward stuff I mean again in the in-between vibing stuff well just improv but we're not like doing specific moves to like build a tractor or something like that I'll just have a lot of little one-liners and stuff why don't you get bored doing that shit but I don't some people hate it Tyler can't stand it he can't fucking stand saying the same shit twice because it's in his nature he's got that sort of his mind's racing so fast and everything for me personally it's like the same reason why I can go up and I can sing at karaoke song that I've sung a thousand times before and not be bored with it because for me it's not about that particular song for me it's about hitting the notes it's about hitting the waypoints in the interaction and it's about connecting with the audience right so again familiarize yourself with anything that you can do to get yourself like on stage whether that's Toastmasters whether that's public speaking whether it's you know karaoke acting improv class or just again doing an approach and making the choice to relate don't view it as being an attention whore beauties are making a decision to relate okay yeah  so I also repeated yeah louder to Katti batti louder at all louder by the way he already said there he said god dammit this and do you know why he said this because in every fucking video we do this the guy stands up he's not talking loud and then we say talk louder and then he doesn't and now we've got to spend 10 minutes berating him come up please  [Applause] Roger listen him with country--its okay so okay say save the crowd here say hey guys how'd it go no there you through the crowd here  yeah say it to the crowd is like a ventral you're like trying to throw your voice like that that all right say it hey guys how's it going hey guys how's it going okay that was pretty good but what level do you think he's at in terms of percentage I think he's probably about your prob about sixty it's not too bad okay you're actually not that bad I want you now to say to the consider guys hey group go say to them hey group hey Brooke okay how about okay fine let's say it let's do it what's up bitch is what's up okay interesting he's still what what's going on there that's like happening what does this voice sound like it sounds almost like it's pinched okay it sounds kind of pinched so here's the thing what does everyone always say speak from the diaphragm right but most people they interpret that to mean what you're pushing error it's not a pushing of air there's two things happening number one I want you to think of putting the voice box the laryngeal position a little down okay so kind of think of done and I want you to think about bouncing the sound off the hard Talent so almost yawn like you're going to yawn as you'll feel it will feel the spread area I feel your tongue where you're the roof of your mouth starts to slope up that's the time to halt that's called the hard palate so there's two things we're going to do here number one there's a it's like a muscle around your esophagus around your trachea here and that's called the aryepiglottic sphincter all right so when opera singers project and hear myself or Tyler be able to project in a room without using amplification the only reason I use the amplification is to save my voice long term or an opera singer being able to carry over an orchestra it's this quality called ring so it's not coming from here but you're pinching it here think of it like if you have a hose please turn the hose on it goes like that but if you pinch the hose what does it do so you're going to do it like a user so once you kind of pinch that and then think about bouncing the sound off the top with a loose jaw so let's do it one more time okay so hey bitches hey this is better but I want you to sustain that that energy ok so again hey bitches hey bitches okay pretty good but you feel ready drop them off a little bit at the end that's not from the vocal technique you know that's from a mental block that's the conviction the fucking conviction that's another aspect to the vocal training and by the way this is like what my resonator program is about I worked with this woman Susan Nance she's been doing this stuff for 40 years a lot of people like what makes you qualified to do this well I'm not that's why I went to a professional person and had her help me with the product with the program so the thing is with the conviction though note it see it still seems like when he's saying that he's working against the expectations of the group okay so I want you to be working with the remember their safety in the group so let's all say it together first ready hey one more time hey and now you alone ha much better that actually got to myself and by the way  here have a seat and we'll hit your question really quick yes I'll have a seat I want to show you one interesting thing here and so this is in fact you want to try to get this on camera so this is a representation of the vocal apparatus and I show this and actually Brad saw it it's like this is the most disturbing thing I've ever seen on the Internet so it's like again you got the hard palate the soft palate the oral cavity the tongue position the throat position so we can play with this sounds like yeah yeah yeah la la la right nasal the lips  right right so what did you see because you see different vowels come from different areas of the mouth - so like it again the e is tend to come from up front it goes like e eh ah oh oh oh I forget which but like if we do this it's like so fun fun pretty fun so um so again in this program the resonator coming on through 21st do you want to check it out we talked about how to articulate how to get into again different laryngeal positions for different vowels how to you know all that technical stuff then we also talked about tonality variants and emotion conviction then I also added in a whole fucking long segment on the grammar of storytelling as well as how to go about really methodically developing your humor right because again it's like the ability to project is the base then the ability to like relate information in a compelling way that just doesn't sit there like in a list that's the second and then how to have it be funny right so anyway long story short that's that now so what was the actual question sorry oh sure yeah and just project this time other relationship right now and know how to gain my government in the relationship cause keep it going in how to keep it going well okay look I've had a lot of relationships and you know and every single one that's they've all broken up but uh you know after I just you know you got to do the postmortem and you got to say where was she responsible where was I responsible and when I figure out how I was responsible I swore in each instance that I would never make those particular mistakes again however there is an infinite way number of ways to be a fucking there's an infinite number of ways to be a fucking idiot and so you're you know look no relationship stuff is guaranteed to last who knows maybe yours is the exception to the rule you're gonna be together at age 85 holding hands in love and your golden years and all that just like you know your grandparents or whatever however maybe not but the most the most important thing there's no guarantees the most important thing you can do though I would say for me I'd say there's got to be a level of honesty and upfront Ness in terms of what your expectations are and if those change you might have to renegotiate the fucking rules look back in the day I used to just cheat I had a girlfriend I'm love almost always had a girlfriend during this whole fucking experience of a pickup right now I haven't R I don't have one I've been out for about a year now which is fine you know it's fine I don't I don't feel so like desperate need to get back in a relationship but the thing is I used to cheat and I thought I was like I could be like you know Dexter I'd have the double life I had like a change of clothes in the fucking van and shit right we call them van jammas their vantage amaz they're called van jammas you put them on you put them on the girl as well they have pictures of ice cream and tacos on them but it's like dude my fucking girlfriend she's not stupid she knows what the fucking van is for okay and so eventually you go you're going to get caught doing that eventually at along enough timelines you're going to fuck up something's going to happen someone's going to see out with the other chick you're going to get fucking caught and you're going to fuck your get it's done and the thing is when I saw when I got caught I saw how like devastated this girl is it's like a wifey material because like I screened very hard you think i screen hard for some fucking gate national fucking hard i screen for a relationship like she's got to be perfection in terms of like the background her attitude or you know her personality and her job so forth everything so she was very loyal and then she was like fucking destroyed and I saw how badly she was hurt by that and I was like I'm never going to do that shit again right so I decided going forward they need to know I'm not going to be in a monogamous relationship and I've tried it it's great for some people okay look I'm not hating on monogamy so my best friends are monogamous right like something like a racist would say like I so my best friends are black but my best friends were monogamous just not for me man and I know I'm tied to all these are all feel to all sheets or I'll feel trapped I'll feels like in fucking trap so going forward my next door when I told her look I need to let you know I'm so going to be seeing other girls blah blah you can I don't give a fuck what you do either somebody what about least jealous people they'll ever meet I don't know why I just not jealous and so I know a lot of guys aren't wired like me so I get it you know but if she is up five in fact I hope she was out fucking around because at least then you know yeah good something to do when I'm not there I don't I don't have to deal with all their shit all the time so but here's the thing she didn't fuck around she but she just let me do it and the thing with that is they'll be cool with it till they're not they'll be cool with it and tells they're not and so I realized and then we broke up and you know she eventually her mind changed on that and so I realized eventually it for it to be long-term sustainable for me at least she's got to be at least on some level down to go pick up with me right and so I will never get into another long-term relationship again unless the chick is willing and able to go pick up with me and because I go when I travel I go I do all these adventures and far-flung realms and then she sees like YouTube of me doing all this shit and like fucking in the club and then I go home this is work for travels work from you home is my vacation so when I'm at home I just like watch fucking TV and shit I don't like go out I go out here right so it's like you're this crazy guy but then when you come home you're just like watching fucking is fucking boring so she couldn't participate in the adventures so my last girl she participating the fucking adventures and the fucking adventures were like mythological in nature and it was the best fucking couple years of my fucking life at age 40 imagine that - how many guys in here like 20 years old right now like early 20s so many of you most likely think and I hear the sentiment quite a bit I'm going to do this till I'm like you know 30 and then I'll settle down I'll settle down it's like let me tell you newsflash motherfucker that's gonna happen real quick and guess what when it happened you're not going to be like met like 30 years birthday look Oh magically want to settle down especially if you know how to do this stuff well why would you why why the fuck would you and I got to say like it when I was in my early 30s my ability to like pick up younger girls slowed down a bit why why do you think that happened self-conscious I was self-conscious about it was like well now I'm going to have trouble now I'm in the 30s the big three now I'm going to have trouble and so I struggled for the first like a couple of years with it actually and now and you know the guy like who's fucking 40 I I'm fucking girls half my age on the Reg on the Reg okay no that's nothing to be proud of on the Reg okay I was like let's go let's go right and it's fucking awesome and who would have thought I certainly would have thought that that the best game of my life would be it oh I'm fucking 40 holy fucking shit it's again the point being it's never-ending this shit will end when your dick falls off or you die okay hopefully you die before your dick fuck top whichever comes first yeah but again it just goes man and for you guys are like older and thinking about I thought well maybe I missed by the boat to kind of get into this and learn this dunno you dude it's always possible to start just fucking start man you know I have I have I know guys friends of mine who are like in their 60s and yeah these guys aren't banking the the 20 year olds on the Reg on occasion they do but you know you know they're fucking like some hot 30 year old 35 year old that's fine for you know some sick some old ass motherfucker fine so back to this relationship question  personally for me I wouldn't even get in a relationship unless unless it was open in that way right so I guess what you're asking though is you want to go out and keep gaming or something like this I mean oh you want to game her fucking ass well here's the thing for me this is my style and this style does not work for everyone the style is it's very much my way or the highway it's like I will fuck it like it's actually bad this is actually bad but this is kind of like my thing I will go straight to the fucking break-up well if she's like I don't know if I like this I'm like well then get the fuck out get the fuck from around me then I'll be sad but you know I don't want to hold you here if you're not enjoying this there's the door there's the door get the fuck out right and this will work for a long time until it doesn't work again that that's that's what works for me I just I have like I'm extremely uncompromising in what I believe is the but at the same time I understand the value I'm bringing to the table and my mentality is who the fuck is she gonna find as good as me but good luck I've seen the guys out there makes me glad I'm not you have fun go have fun go find yourself go find yourself a nice little lawyer chode that your fucking friends can be proud of that's some weird fucking cult leader okay that's reviled in the media and banned from a continent okay but at the same time you need to screen upfront for someone who's going to be cool with a more edgy person with someone who's kind of like out there and who's not in the little box of society so really it's got to come from place of a selfish self-acceptance and then I think be you know holding out for the right girl and I think that's the reason why we date so many people well one of the reasons pussy but uh one of the reasons to it's it's not so you can like find out what you like in the girls you can find out what you don't like in the girl like I figured out what I will not accept for termination I just know and I saw on an intrinsic level I'm hanging out with that person I'm like no my none another sigh like yeah I like the sex but it's just not going to work out right and just and is having uncompromising standards again maybe not to that point but by the way so here's like the final takeaway for that the thing that makes that work you have to have a zero fear of loss zero fear a lot 100% willingness to fucking loss and you know like I said I it kind of sucks that you got to be very careful about going to that well to you know try to handle it diplomatically at first but if you've got to go to that well you got to go to that Webster's do it her a favor ultimately okay so let's do a quickie little breakdown on what happened there and now it is time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the set-set-set-set 80% of the time this is the problem Hey hi freeze motherfucker a good evening he doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him so why the find a function she this is the roof of the mouth right here right yes [Music] smelling something nice touching shoulders ah that's the touchdown right they're not just being loud but being clear so this right sometimes people will say well what they heard you they heard the noise good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps of cheese and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding that was good so uncomfortable you look good ah that was a nice clenching in here in order to yes that's what we don't want okay let's we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow they're swollen this is probably what my boss's cords look like Island City Attorney tricks any time you talk you talk enough oh I'm like a literally cringing she was like my voice tone was like oh like average but yours is like amazing [Music] yes don't do this okay sit down shut up blah blah deal if you're down here yeah yeah yeah yeah oh you're done your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a to mate where we're telling stories do you want to be more excited haha or do you need to be more like calm and collected and that will change often dynamically during the interaction adult it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn the stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice you're going to be able to go out and take your finger like this and push it push it and then what and that wears it's the weirdest thing when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I totally believe it it's only a matter of time until they like awesome remain au pair evicted I love my family gave me a huge ferreira of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicality behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling in jhummer sit on a number you know father like hello LM Elohim I write that you know it's a little act and that success mostly quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game contest as like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself Jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve we're so so so long [Music] you  you  ha  you,k1hS66A3c7E
yeah all right thanks to uh that is Nair for intro e8 it's actually staying in my home the anticipation is rival I wrote on the passive-aggressive whiteboard of doom in the kitchen learning my roommates you say your I wrote it up for my friend Madison Montreal will be staying if you knew your own next couple of days don't be alarmed he's black he thinks that the funny but my roommates the speech San Francisco girl be did they got mad because we all know San Franciscans are notoriously tolerant and tell they're not so um I noticed he was up you're wearing sunglasses as well it's a good look that first actually inspired me to put on some ridiculous shit and I know why I'm going to Donnie come ku headband so give me a moment here so let the power kind of course course through my veins okay shit so yeah um so it's going to be here that you know I live here is my hometown well sort of I've been here twenty years twenty odd years now and uh I guess you're allowed to say you're from here after that maybe I don't know a couple of months ago I decided to quit drinking now for those of you who know me this might come as a shock like a very like a massive shock but people are I was like why well um a couple of reasons I had been getting in a lot of fights I'll you know it's weird because you guys probably can't relate to this but let me just kind of give you a glimpse into what it's like to be a it sounds lame even saying this out loud YouTube celebrity it sounds even lamer when you say it out loud and doesn't your head um but people will come up to you I mean most people are very cool and those be you know respectful hey man I like to shit whatever handshake um but some try to do like we're - it don't try to like touch your face I had to do like I had to do here you come appealing to show you real quick like say you're me and you're in the club you're like talking to someone sky can watch means like this and like tried to hold my fucking hand alright thank you like what the fuck so you know when intoxicated I would you know physically assault these people and I was like you know it's only a matter of time before you catch some kind of charge and you gotta chill and then I was also roofied in New Orleans at Mardi Gras and it wasn't actually intended for me it was I was it you know I was talking some girl and she's like oh hey I got a piece my friends whatever but do you want my drink I barely even touched it like a full drink oh yeah cool Thanks Cheers drinking it next thing I know I'm like right and I don't really remember much however there is a video of me staggering through the French Quarter lecturing someone off camera about cyberbullying and I'm very passionate about it in the my fucking kids and Susa right so I was like you got a chill bro but you know a lot of guys it's interesting to me because a lot of guys consider alcohol to be like some like a benefit to them and pick up to me it's like it's like a handicap and when I say a handicap I mean like in golf where it makes it fair you understand it's like because by the end of the night everyone shit-faced and they literally think this guy's fuckin Einstein this guy's Stephen Hawking without the fucking wheelchair except slightly better looking and so yeah yours running verbal circles around people some drunk dude tries getting your face he's like what you're like right just dodging it like it's fantastic the only drawback is that you think everyone at the end of nights a fucking idiot and I've had to do I'm sure those of you were sober I've had to deal with this where you know the cute antics at the beginning of the night become increasingly retarded until you're like dude I don't even want to be near these people like the friends falling down so on and so forth they're battling and I talked to Tyler about this he's like yeah it's the hardest part man right like he knows the struggle because he's never fucking trained so but yeah so it's been really great you know I feel like a young boy I feel like a new man and so what's old I got um I actually took that line from the soliloquy and trash humpers I don't know if you ever seen that it's a Harmony Korine film 2010 best film of 2010 in my opinion I like to put it on if I pull a girl back often it's about these elderly people that hump trash that's pretty much it check it out right write that down um but anyway what's old is new again and that we were on the way here and that's kind of the theme of my little presentation here today throwback Thursday if you will and as such you know I've been doing a lot of old school pick up crap right recently but slightly adapted to the modern age the modern Gilded Age which we live and so for example this shit if I wear this out what is this what is this called peacocking okay and peacocking is basically one of the two things that pick up became known for in the wake of the cultural phenomenon known as neil strauss of the game of course followed by the vh1 television program the pickup artists starring mystery negs and peacocking right but peacocking I don't know I started dipping my foot into it again recently now back in the day I don't know if you ever fly said funny I don't know if you've ever seen dipping my foot into a peacock like what so I don't know if you've ever you ever seen photographs of us back in like 2002 or 2003 when we talk about peacocking we used to dress in like the most garish ridiculous shit imaginable like I would have a three-piece pink suit on with like rabbit ears for no apparent reason about 15 pounds worth of ridiculous obviously fake bling of rings on every finger these like weird like bondage straps on every fuck like all up the arm I knew this one dude he'd wear five watches for like again no reason like these giant like boots like a plastic pants that looks like a snake's skin mesh shirts like a dude you fucking name it we even made a one to go out wearing a garbage bag once because we told him it I'm like its alpha bro like it's fucking alpha so then like a chic headdress and all this weird shit so so I'll often throw on bootcamp if you're a boot camp in this weekend you'll probably make you wear some ridiculous shit at some point now let's pause for a moment to examine the underlying principles by which peacocking is affected which make peacocking effective so what's going on with peacocking why is it why was it even adopted as a tactic in the first place that's a big one right here what he said it gives any girl who is attracted to you who thinks you're attractive an excuse to speak to you okay because let's face it most girls probably won't go up to a guy and and open him and introduce themselves to him it's it's pretty rare of course many will but generally the way the game is played like that the way society dictates like they don't go they're not going to go up and be like hey sexy whatever right however if I'm wearing some retarded shit then she can come up and she can speak to me okay so for example uh another another Vegas story I was in Vegas two weeks ago and we were at Marquee and I did not have this amazing headband with me at the time but sometimes we'll do something that we call toilet paper miyagi and if we have a student who is particularly stifled in his head whatever you want to call it will often you know say it's time for toilet paper Miyagi and we'll we'll make it happen so what we tell them we've like look go to the bathroom and if he's being a real bitch I go to the bathroom stare yourself in the mirror for five minutes and cry right so so I'm liking then when you're done bring toilet paper a lot of it it's like why just go right so he goes I need invariably brings the toilet paper back and we'll then you know fold it and put it on his head in like a toilet paper headband and he must then approach women and say good evening my name is Miyagi I will teach you karate and the student he actually did this the other night he went to these girls he's like I'm yogi I'll teach you karate and she's like that's racist cuz she was Japanese but I was like well okay uh yeah but so so it's interesting because with peacocking but being part of it is allowing you know it's giving people an opportunity way to introduce themselves that one aspect of the second aspect of it is um basically a lot of people say oh it makes you stand out and that in and of itself generates a fraction but that's really not the case what it's generating is attention people are going to looking people are going to make comments about it and it's not so much that you have a bear fact you have an arm it's going to generate a tragic what's going to make you look good is you're handling the attention the social pressure if you will that accompanies wearing is garish name with grace many many students when I happen where the peacock II never fucking freak out they can't handle now like the trunk paper Miyagi will be trippin balls good we saw Mary move the hip  - sorry boys I'm taken don't be like oh my god everyone can be they take okay  right so you know I'll wear that weapons - and if some girls okay tonight this is real kiss good she can store came up to the other day it's like why are you sash did you did looks like are you gay I take a step back I look up and down like I am now  I'm also happy okay but when he's duck dynasty motherfuckers anti-gay maritime this 21st century gave them blacks we don't make a lot of homosexuals that you want okay I got you lol so you know this duck lather it away so long story short um so I'm in days and I have the toilet paper Miyagi on myself and it's true who's getting tools these direct much toilet paper writer had Genovese like oh my god but always sure about it and that's the thing if you're insecure about it people are gonna tool you even more back when I used to go out wearing that like pink suits and all of that stuff I wore out where the pink suit and I was in like a great mood they be like Jim look at this guy - like I'd hear it when on duty this is shit bro my god yeah big sooo bad kinda get your way they people would love it I wherever I went out I was kind of in my head I was going to stifle I be giving out more than I was self-conscious about it and people would react accordingly maybe like to you here but this fuckin killing your suit bro all sarcastic and shit like throwing little things over right they says weakness they pounce um so anyway so I got the damn Miyagi you know headdress on and I'm standing there and these these blessing girls behind all right Hedy hey excuse me huh like what is inside your head fucking toilet paper oh my yeah you know how some people go in the bathroom and then they come out in the guy like - okay brother yeah baby except I did I was like rolling my fucking right huh it makes no fucking sense here's a big thing a lot of you guys are laboring under the impression that you need to make sense when you're talking to people whether it be on the club whatever tiny stuff makes sense with all its daily how do I transition into doing this or saying this or the next phase where there's no transition if there does not need to be some smooth segue okay into the next fucking tape you just fucking time in fact what I find is the less sense I make typically love that right the lessons inside a try to make sense but no one wants to make sense of sake Club these people in the club are not here to kill a swash for fucking emotional scars what are they there for your time they're there to unwind from their stressful work week you know where's the pickup guide make it when he goes the times like bullshit then Jim what's my angle of approach Chris by opening where's my value relative to their system so the presentation once I said that where the girls the game morning I can  I can't obey camera Tasha my girlfriend's like Jeff is not what you think in the club like pretty much but uh they're not they don't give a fuck I've said this before they're not going to go up here to be like oh how are you if there's any sort of awkwardness nervousness meeting it's to work the bloody awesome off anything that is not contribute to them having a good night having a fun time it is up adding energy again this like reaching energy will be summarily dismissed like fuck off and the friend is not good human need you know early so hard because you know he's on his surety himself actually so sorry  never twilight van Fisher so she okay  anyways last three Jen again wants very short sure sure they're like are you oh my god Jeff Allen J value valincia Belgian filters ever and so I fuck off and I do some other bullshit on my coach in Utah direct at the end of the night I get this text as I hate Jeffrey Dahmer that was they told it just went over and they're like my name's Jeff what's your last name I'm like its Dahmer do this she's like it doesn't look like you oh I have a beard now it says your nickname is terrible so yeah she's like chappie jump how much who the fuck is this and I'm sitting down right out the lobby of front of um you don't work either and then the chick jumps on my fucking lap out of nowhere it's like pretty pretty hexing girl not bad I was like okay my take me help for you like okay again I need to do anything anything is fucking do anything now granted sometimes God drop shit your lap like that most of the time you does it but if you're going out with a lot of frequency that will happen from time to time it will happen from time to time there's Mike this is my shit this is my finish this fucking thing here man it's done it's a done deal toys are not moron you don't fuck up the call right so it's up the power peacock needs not to be underestimated it is not to be on a recipe now another thing that I've been also doing uh what's another big problem early days of pickup yes negs okay we'll talk about that next now I don't really like that shit I personally don't use it but I do occasion use something called that I personally have followed the pause and it's an obviously opposite of the net I wasn't Nick I was a lawyer backhanded compliment so this is a four-handed in sir Kampala salt if you build um and I first get like sturdy wrap my head around this wind up I had a roommate combine and she uh she was a crazy first chick she was about

you know yo what up its new your proverbial boy Jeffy I'm here today in San Francisco and today I wanted to address a question that I got from somebody and it revolves around the staff at the venues that you're choosing two three morons okay so this guy says this hey how do you deal with the staff throwing salt under game I've noticed them giving me the side eye after repeated visits I want to curb this before it becomes a problem as well you should I discovered another venue within walking distance so I'm gonna try bouncing back and forth so I'm not seeing that often but that's the only solution I've come up with now this was posted in the execute the program group and different guys said different things in response to this question one guy said just keep going to the same place realistically nothing will happen another dude said lol I got so much hate because I was killing it with women at a venue so again there's like a lot of different experiences a lot of different opinions on this personally I think I'm uniquely qualified to address this as I've had you know I've been doing this for many many years I've also you know been a bit of a minor local celebrity and not for the good reasons and I've been you know 86 from venues i I've seen other guys doing ridiculous behaviors that have been 86 from venues I have also had certain venues where I was treated essentially like God and everything in between so I'm gonna go ahead and let you know what the dealio is with regard to how you should be interacting with the staff at these venues that your frequent your frequenting as you're doing game whether that be you know beast mode straight-up cold approach night game or whether it be like on a date or something of that nature okay so let's crack into it if we're talking about like dates for example you know I've had places where I've taken literally thousands of dates and to this day I still I still essentially go to mostly the same couple of places and the reasons for that are logistics convenience etc and it's really never been a problem for me taking hundreds I've got thousands of days to these same places until of course I was put on blast in the media but that's a whole another issue in fact I remember one time I even actually matched with a girl who was a bartender at the place and she had seen me taking these gross through all the time and I went on the date with her and hooked up with her of course she insisted that we go to this place in like the industrial part of town so so nobody would recognize her because she worked in the industry and you know it's a very small a small world she didn't wanna be like oh look she's going out with Jeffy you know cuz again they know who the hell I am they know what I'm doing there etc etc so that was kind of funny but the main thing is you've got to cultivate a certain awareness right and that's that's the key thing you can't just be like obliviously walking around like it's Disneyland like without any regard to what the hell you're doing for example you know I've had friends of mine or you know guys from inner circle I've seen just doing ridiculous things like ham-fisted approaches like literally going into a girl and being like hey lady what's up you want to bang and they're like just like oh no thank you you know my friends whatever and then it's like oh how about you like literally going from girl to girl to girl to girl to girl and everyone around can see this person is clearly doing some weird shit you understand like this it's not normal behavior or clearly this guy's doing some kind of like weird thing it's a weirdo doing weird shit as we like to call it colloquially and you know a lot of times what will happen is the style start to get complaints or the staff will just flagrantly notice it and be like yo just pick up shitting at a fly or get the fuck out like so you have to be aware of how you're coming off now a lot of us would say wasn't this paradox it'll be like being your own reality don't care what others think it's like look you got to strike a balance between the two like Tyler's always saying there's nuanced points that can seem paradoxical so yes on the one hand you know want to feel stifled you don't want to feel like oh do I look cool are people making fun of me etc but on another level you got to be aware how what are the dynamics is insofar as the venue is concerned right but again most of the time people are so wrapped up in their own head you really got to be doing something super weird in order to get attention like that like a lot of guys I got a bootcamp student recently who was like but if I approach several girls in the same venue and they see me approaching won't they think like I'm a loser and it's bad social proof it's like most people are so wrapped up in what's going on in their own head they're not paying attention to you unless you're doing some like ask clownery that's going to draw their attention so again it's a bit of a balance but but start to be aware of that right like don't literally just go from girl to girl to girl like open a girl then go to a different part of the club and open right etcetera etc again cultivate an awareness and if there is some kind of incident like you're you know you're too drunk and you cause a scene and they're like you know you do get 86 I would say the most important thing is just to like leave immediately like without causing us it cuz a lot of times guys well you know people come up me like hey now you're you're getting kind of buck wild and then they'll like argue with the staff they'll be like well no man what I'm not allowed to pick up to do it's like dude all you're doing with that it's not like you're gonna win them over they're gonna be like oh well I'm so glad that you gave your your opinion on this you know what you changed my mind why don't you stay here and continue to harass people and affect our bottom line it's like dude all that's gonna do like I said it's not gonna win them over but in all its gonna do is make them remember you more the next time you come in so again if there's any sort of like incident the staffs like hey you know you got to go I don't even question I'm just like all right bye and I was like boom like you know without like I'm not like actually like putting a hood over my face but I essentially for all intents and purposes I'm just like alright later and I'll just like boom without saying anything and then I'll probably again avoid that place for a period of time depending on how like wild the incident was for example you know I've had several incidents where like the students you know was not well calibrated and did some crazy shit and I was like with him at the time and they saw me with that guy so just to be on the safe side I say I put on like my my serie like my calendar I'd be like okay two months before I can go back to this place like for a full fiscal quarter if it was really bad just to kind of avoid getting that reputation as that guy that causes an issue in the in the in the venue if we're talking about dates that's kind of like a separate thing because it's not like you're running around beasting you're actually meeting someone there but one thing if you watch execute the program you'll know that one thing that I do to kind of mitigate people from kind of taking an overt interest in the date itself is when I first meet them if you know we meet at the bar I'll actually be like hey long time no see hey how's it yeah you look good Oh almost like it's a it's kind of a joke because we've never seen each other before so the girl will kind of like a long time no see ha ha ha but also to anyone sitting in the vicinity they're likely to think that we know each other and we're just like friends or something and we're just meeting up there so that's gonna cause the the bartender's to be less likely to like eavesdrop on your date and kind of like look in on it and be again take an overt interest in what you're actually saying another little tip that can be pretty helpful is to avoid sitting at the service well like I don't want to be in front of the service well anyway or anywhere near that because I just have like I don't know I guess you call it like it's in my blood that's like a Caucasians aversion to just being in the way like I just hate being in the way but what I mean also is like if it's the area where they mix the drinks and they're gonna be standing there like directly in front of you like two feet across room for like long periods of time that's probably not a good place to sit because then just I mean even if they're not trying to eavesdrop they're actually going to end up eavesdropping by default just because of the you know because of the way it's logistical II situated so that's a couple of issues but like I said you know I literally had places where I've been hundreds and hundreds of times and it wasn't much of an issue basically if you think it's gonna be a problem then it's gonna be right it's a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy if you will because if you're concerned about it your demeanor is gonna adopt certain characteristics that are being it gonna be getting that off and almost causing it to happen more like when I went into these places I was just almost like redic obnoxious about it to the extent that like the staff I think they found it kind of funny they're like oh here's this guy again and they kind of I found it like sort of amusing and I kind of got the sense at this one place and I took like hundreds of hundreds hundreds and hundreds of dates to that they sort of like lived vicariously through it and again they just found it like vaguely amusing they're like ah this fucking guy then again I am I happen to be incredibly cool and charming so your results may vary and like I said literally the only time that I had a problem is when I had like a media scandal and it blew up and they're like this is where he goes he goes to this restaurant and this bar slash restaurant and then I'm the next time I went to that place which was like a month half maybe two months after that happened the bar manager was like what the hell are you doing man he's like you got me in so much trouble like what do you mean they're like it's like the owner read that shit and he came in he's like what the hell are you guys doing here he's like who is this Jeff guy what the fuck are you doin to today's like I don't know this guy I don't know this time like I'm like yeah sorry about that man and he's like I'm like so one of my band he's like no you're not 86th but you probably shouldn't bring any more first dates here but again unless you're having some crazy media scandal this probably is gonna happen remember the bottom line with most game but it all comes back to what number one rule whatever you feel they feel so again don't worry about it until it becomes a problem and then handle it after the fact if you're at the bar beasting or whatever again you have to understand people go there to do that all the time not just people who study this stuff to social dynamics normal people are going there to do that all the time and most likely the people who work there go to those same types of venues to do the exact same thing right probably with each other as well at the in the industry themselves so then ultimately you understand ultimately the people that work at these these venues they are there to do what to do one thing to make money not to be like the arbiter of what constitutes socially acceptable behavior unless you go out of your way to like do some bizarre stuff or you're affecting their bottom line they're probably not gonna get a care about it and again remember the big thing like don't be running around thinking like oh the social proof what if I get blown out etc most people remember are paying attention to themselves above all and again unless you're doing something wild your problem is probably not gonna be an issue another thing is - and this is a huge needin help me I always make a point at these places to befriend the staff especially any place that I've been that I'm going for like I've been going or I go with regularity I want to like chat the staff I want to chat them up like they're a normal human being like especially if I'm there and you know even there with the girl like on a date or whatever or even just they're going up to get a drink I'm gonna chitchat them I'm not gonna die give me my fucking drink fucking slave yeah really I'm gonna talk to them like you're a person I'm gonna crack jokes I'm gonna ask my other nights going now in a weird like suck-up ingratiating way because that looks weird but just like it just like a cool chill normal person right additionally I also make sure to tip well right that's a huge thing I mean it's a look it's look there is a bit of a fine line like the guy that goes something's like here's $20 it's almost like you're my you work for me now like you don't make it weird but it's like tip them very well the thing is over time if you're cool with the people and you're going there with regularity and your tip and well you'll start to get to the point where they'll they'll probably be giving you like free shit again the bottom line is they are there to make money not to be the arbiters of what constitutes socially acceptable behavior and trust me they've probably seen way way worse on a nightly basis I'm talking about like people being just assholes like people puking on the floor people breaking stuff getting in fights etc etc so again unless you're doing something weird it's the shit they're seeing as small potatoes and remember they're there to make money and like I said when I go to these places I'm I'm not only buying shit like not just asking for tap water and like filling up a cup of tap water in the sink like even if I go there to not drink all I'll order like a soda with bitters in it and a lime and then I'll pay for it as though it were a drink so I'm not just like this mooch that went there to like take advantage of like of the women they've brought to this place and not pay them anything like to help keep the lights on right so understanding that and like I said if I'm like joking with them flirting with them like they're normal people like they're my buddies and tipping them heavily like again not exorbitant ly where it's ridiculous but tipping them well over time they're gonna see that this dude is what this guy's like a regular customer they're gonna start to give you preferential treatment even they're gonna start to give you free stuff right I remember at that uh that bar that I just told you about where I take all the dates who literally I would go in there and I would sit down with my date they'd be like watch out for this guy that'd be like Oh what I'm like I'm like hey you guys want to do a shot and they're like we do a free shot together and like it was like this just general kind of like bonhomie like social proof there's like we're all there and it's like a friendly place and you know again again it's social proof and the girls would often say oh would you come to this place a lot I'd be like yeah it's kind of like cheers you know where everybody knows your name and thinks you're an asshole ha ha ha anyway doesn't into that and right and they'd be like again they would help me on the actual date and I would just get like massively free free stuff whenever I'd go there and then it's funny because that place it changed ownership and now when I go in there it costs like money and like what the hell is this I have to pay but again that's something that can happen all the time when I go to like bars a lot of the time even if I'm not on a date I'll be like chatting with the bartender and they'll ask me the Big O so what bar do you work at like they just assume I'm an industry person I'm like no I don't work in the industry I just drink a lot they're like ah ha ha because I'm able to talk to them about like alcohol and like you know different types of drinks and cocktails like I'm well versed of things that bartender is kind of like generally or like to talk about I was with Julian in Las Vegas for the most recent world summit and we sat then I was chopping up at the bartender and sooner you know sure enough he brings us a couple free four nets and he's like so where do you work I'm like no I don't I'm not industry I'm just I just drink a lot hey yeah cool guys have a great night it's really cool talking to you and Julian's like how do you do this because every time I go to like a bar with Julian the bartender gives us free stuff it's like wow Jeff you're really good at just like chit-chatting and making small talk with people who are in the venue and that's the thing you know if you've been with me out or on like program or something like that you'll notice I really don't hold a lot of stock in other people's opinions like I'm kind of like a jerk to a lot of people unless you know unless they've earned respect I'm like this person's nothing to me they're garbage except for one class of person and that's the staff and I treat them like God you know I mean even if I'm like standing in the way and the guys like trying to get by and look oh shit sorry man oh hey yeah cool cool right alright and I also I make sure to actually bus my drinks if I'm sitting in a table before I leave the place I'll take pick up my drink and I'll set him down okay thanks as I leave I'm always like hey cheers thank you as I leave again to get that going to get the ball rolling on becoming that regular becoming that guy that they recognize and take as a cool guy and then the thing is once that happens it's not you're not worrying about like or they noticing that I'm doing pickup it's the opposite you're happy that they notice you there because they think you're cool they're there to help you and they're on your team and they'll even help you with the girls or if there's like an incident in the bar some kind of confrontation they'll be on your side it'll be more apt to take your side it you know some some kind of weird shit goes down so bottom line if you joke around game and flirt with the actual staff and you pay attention to them and treat them like human beings and not this like detriment or obstacle to the weird shit you're trying to do in the venue this is gonna pay massive dividends and you can in fact do this with everyone in your life right not just not just the bar staff but the cashier at the Safeway and Center the mailman and Senators people you see on the street and it's just part of becoming generally more social and outgoing and ultimately that's what game is about it's about being able to relate with people win them over and get them on your side and make new France sometimes friends that you can put your genitals on anyway there's been Jeffy I hope this video helped you out and I'll see you next time and now it is time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the SATs at SATs at 80% of the time this is the problem but the way he said it was it lacked that condition he's like you're hahaha it has this wavering tonality the voice this is the root of the mouth right here not just being loud but being clears [Music] that's the touchdown right yeah it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of a long-term health for your voice you're going to be able to go out and project  [Music],kSCHjlMDX1s
all right all right fantastic thank you for all coming out to hear my bullshit I'd like to thank max for opening up for me the latest RC instructor from Australia so let's down under like another great australian arnold schwarzenegger who came to this country and him famous for working out and became the governor of california hopefully he'll achieve greater things as well and or be able to find a shirt that fits so i also noticed there's a children here tonight which is  I I can I can see it now seventh grader suspended for not leaving room for the Holy Ghost at junior high dance and saying Pikachu and bringing their heads whose dick so anyway so stay in school that's what I would say stay in school I dropped out but it's fine don't follow my example anyway so enthusiastic gentlemen the front row yes first of all I want to thank you for your dual induction massage techniques from preschool or um okay thank you you're welcome so my question is going to be as you're an expert in three more guys when girls fictions because  okay hold on I think I'm gonna I'm gonna need you to elaborate on that because it just said it just seemed like you want to have threesomes with men Grindr it's like tinder but with a G Grindr well first up I don't do that devil's threesome shit okay I had I had one experience with that and I decided I would never do that again how many guys near have ever actually DP'd a girl you guys know what that is right you're you're double penetrating her okay so when this happens you can feel the other man's dong through it like a membrane and I personally found this somewhat unsettling your mileage may vary and after that I said no more of that and you know what they say it's not gay unless balls are touching so it was totally gay because to angle that so no no after that no more I don't want to see it I don't even I don't want to see my homie naked none of that shit sorry does that make me homophobic I don't know but whatever so I guess what you're asking so are you asking about male threat what am I I don't know okay so I have little or no experience in anything except FFM actually the girls could be very very good at it but the thing about if you're going out with a girl for your wing it's you got to kind of treat it with kid gloves because if she fucks up you can't I can't just yell at her like I would have fucking boot camp so you start crying you know what I mean and something like the other week and robbed the club my put the fucker you do it boxing me out of the sack cuz just no base of things I got a wing I'm like when I come and make a fucking hole don't elbow me out I'm like oh shit god damn it when you're going out to pick up there's a with a girl there's a couple rules that do hold steady across the board I'd say number one you got to do the open right and that's like a that's a real big one I found that it's so easy to make the girl go up and do the open for you cuz the girl can open any one the most difficult fucking group in the club she can saunter up hey and they'll get back oh hello durka durka durka right because they're not you know it's not gonna set off their creeper alarms even though she is a massive fucking creeper but it's not gonna set off those alarms so it's real easy to rely on that crutch but then what happens a lot of times when you go up after her they're gonna be like oh who the fuck is this and me too and I'm here too it's like just some fucking chode interloper right so you got to go up first bring her in now when to bring her in is a bit of a touch-and-go thing as well because if she comes in too early then the girl the target quantum court will think that it's like your girlfriend or some shit and shields back the fuck off if she comes in too late the girl you're talking to my viewer as a threat and try to fucking tular so fine lines like that and then again you just got a teacher basic basic attraction stuff like like my girl she she literally she can go in and blah blah blah blah but she doesn't know how to take things man to woman or in this case woman to woman right and so you teach her some statements of intent you teach her a couple of physicality moves and then you just teach her to fucking you know like how to deal with obstacles things of that nature and it's pretty golden yeah  yeah a lot of people ask this kind of shit they're like how do you how do I get a frame where they're like they're like you know this question gets asked of me it also it gets asked a derrick you guys who Derrick is right it's another guy with a very strong frame but like how do I get to a point right don't give a fuck and you know honestly you do want to give a fuck to an extent right but I'd say like my frame it's it's a combination of that of like a bit of nihilism in my formative years as in addition to living the life right like in embodying it to the core you know you can't just it's like you can't just if you want to be like I'm a punk rocker you can't just like put your hair in a mohawk be like now I'm a punk rocker right that should have to go to the core it's an ethos right it's kind of like a fuck the world type thing where you believe in your own worldview to the bone right and I don't give a shit like what's an example of having a solid frame well I had this girl the other day and she was like I was talking about the van okay I Drive this van I'm into consensual sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of reproduction Dan and you know if you've been on bootcamp you may have had sex in this band but it's somewhere I'm just I don't know I'm talking about or something she's like it's like what's up with this what's this van for I'm like transportation she's like there's something really creepy by the time I get back my got bad why he's all creeped out by the van right look at that statement in that same we're all my suggesting with that I'm suggesting that she is weird for thinking the van is creepy spoiler alert it's massively fucking creepy okay she's not weird but the thing is I believe that 100% the band's just very normal okay and so people will tend to adopt that stronger frame they'll have a tendency to adopt a stronger frame you know it this you can your frame can actually be a counterproductive thing too if it's too strong in some ways I mean for example like most of my girlfriend's my long-term girlfriends one part of the one reason why they hooked up with me and got a you know became my girlfriend was the fact that I have such a strong frame I'm very decisive I do things the way I want them to go like right I don't hear shit that doesn't help me I literally don't even hear it right but if this is the same reason why they break up with me years later right because III don't hear anything that doesn't help me right and have you ever read or well 1984 you know you ever read that book that's a book everyone should read by the way especially in you know this modern age love developments that we've been seeing in our culture in the world especially related technology but in that book he talks about a concept called double think what does double think anyone know that it is a simultaneous holding of two opposing ideas right so yes I know on one hand the Vance super fucking creepy on the other hand I believe to the core is just some fucking car all right now and again like if when I broke up with my last girlfriend she was literally arguing me like there to go Jeff you do this you do that you do this you do that and I'm like but wait what's going on I don't understand she's like motherfucker I just spent five minutes explaining to you I'm like she explains it again I'm like but what's wrong I don't understand like I'm just like this dumbass it was like derping through life phases and you know I again I yeah that's it's true that it's the truth in like a dumb midget with emotional problems the media spinning so again,kpwj8f5HmNo
what I put up this tree Boyd Jeffy company action from the Miami 2016 World Summit it's the fifth and final day I'm about to launch off the panel discussion but before that you hear my voice is fuckin shredded from screaming at strangers in some of the loudest nightclubs in the country or world for that matter for five days straight but I did want to knock out a quick little blog here and I decided to take some questions feel some questions for my facebook feed and so what I'm going to do I'm going to take just kind of the most popular ones I got the most likes and maybe throw a weird one in the mix too so let's get right to it okay so this do it asks how to avoid burnout in the long term and I must again like when you sit with these fucking questions make sure you're having like full sentences burn out in the long term what does it even fucking burn out to towards what like I'm assuming towards pickup okay like look let's address this this is kind of annoying to me that this is even a question burnout the long term okay first of all we all burn out in the long term okay meaning you'll be dead very very shortly you'll be dead real soon bro okay so that's you you're gonna burn on the long term regardless but we're talking about how to avoid burnout of a pickup of interacting with women you're gonna burn out in the long term too and your dick stops working like you know long before you die most likely so what dude what does that even mean burn out simply means I'm assuming without clarification that the D means like he gets sick of going out and interacting with women the you need to make a fundamental a fundamental shift here in your mentality it can't be like this is a chore you're doing you know what I mean you can't really view it as though it's this scary chore thing because look if you hate going to the gym you're not gonna go right rather if you look at the guys who have to have a lifelong commitment to fitness who you know are relatively vital well into their middle age and beyond these are people who love going to the gym they look forward to it and of course and using this gym analogy are there some days when when I wake up and I don't want to go to the gym you know maybe I'm a little sick little hungover there were times when you you there are times you probably wouldn't want to actually go out you know and again sometimes you're gonna be sick sometimes you're gonna have other obligations things of that nature but more often than not it is best to suck that shit up get your ass out the front door put your shoes on slap your ass off the front door and go to the gym even if you you know even if you just say to yourself look my intention is not to oh I'm gonna go down there and I'm just gonna what's gonna do like a quickie abbreviated workout so if you do that what you'll often find is that once you get there and you start getting into the you know you started getting into your workout itself like you know what I'm already here fuck it let's just slam it out and 9 times out of 10 you're gonna feel far far better for having done that when you get home after be like man if I had just sat here and stood in my own misery all afternoon I you know I would have felt like a lot worse than I do now I feel great now I feel better so taking that analogy home to let's say interacting with the opposite sex interacting with women go into a club going outside and and doing approaches or you know what have you the most important thing is just get out of the fucking house I know maybe that sounds like kind of I don't facile advice but it's quite profound actually if a lot of times you just get your ass outside the front door and get down to whatever venue you have selected you don't meet your friends out what have you once you get out there you're gonna hits right because there's an inertia to whatever you're doing because your brain for example you say you're singing home you're watching the television you're procrastinating work you know you couldn't you know the gym work whatever eat going out doesn't matter if you're at home watching television your brain says well I'm comfortable right now I'm comfortable right now if I go outside I might not be comfortable you have to shake off that inertia and small chunk it don't be like ok I'm gonna have to put my shoes on I'm gonna have to get in the car and have Drive just literally just without as thinking about it thinking about it as little as possible just get up and walk out the fucking front door just do that and the rest will often take care of itself furthermore when we're talking about burnout you know I think it's important to note that I've had many many cycles of being very enthusiastic about this hobby of social interaction and I've also had you know I have cycles where I'm very enthusiastic about I've also had cycles where I'm like yeah men not feeling it anymore so it's important to not look at not be myopic about it in other words to not focus in on where you're at because sometimes again you're gonna have times where you're like absolutely slaying it like you're fucking killing you're going out you're the king of the party life of the party everyone loves you you're hooking up with girls left and right you're you just feel like you're on top of the world and then you might have other times where you're just kinda you know down to the dumps your on I you're a rough patch you know a little dry spell and I've had times right you know if we're talking about hooking up getting laid I've had times ready to lay for months and I thought oh man have I lost the mojo is it gone but you know again having been a involved in this for 15 years now I know that there's a cyclic own nature to it right so accept a cyclic old nature of it and don't beat yourself I'll try to look at the big picture so you don't see those peaks and valleys you see more of a gradual increased slope when you back off and kind of look at the big picture overall so that's how I would suggest to avoid burnout but again we're not it's inevitable so you might as well enjoy it while you can motherfucker now let's take another question here okay this guy asks what to do when you go super hyper or in super good mood to a girl and they get scared from all that energy  I mean the answer is calm your fucking happy ass down bitch can I see this actually from time to time guys students will go into the club and they'll be like hey dude like you know some some Nanak clown bouncing around the club and yes on the one hand you do want to put yourself into the state that you'd like the girl to be in you you want to put yourself into a state that's conducive to a cascade of positive emotions you want to be adding energy to their night as opposed to leeching energy off of them and trying to weasel your way into their party you want to bring the party as opposed to lijing trying to weasel in however at a certain point like okay back up for a second for me for example I'll go up and I'm often very high off my own supply right like I'm not really like interested in what the girl you know butter what where she's from in this kind of shit and at least not at first because think about it most guys will do what they when they approach a woman I would say in a nightclub for example what they'll do is and this is most guys you don't study the stuff they'll go up so the vast majority in other words they'll go up and they'll say they'll touch her on the arm and they'll say you're beautiful so I'm like corny very banal compliment and then they'll immediately try to get rapport with the girl right they'll try to get rapport with your aura so they'll say what's your name what do you do where do you live what did you do today did it in today no the point is this the girl you're making her think you're making her put forth effort and there's no incentive for her to do that yet because she's like who the fuck are you you're some random fucking idiot coming up to you asking all these questions write a random idiot coming up to her and asking questions of her like imagine again one of the biggest things that I can advise is I can give to guys trying to learn this stuff is to put themselves put themselves in the curls shoes right put yourself in the place of the girl and think how would I like it if somebody came up to me like this right so say you're on the on the street and some dude comes up to you and he's like hey man how's it going oh hey how are you using what's your name where you from what are you like you might answer it but you'll be like okay what is this like I don't want to put forth the effort who the fuck is this when are they gonna leave right so rather than doing that you want to like we go for attraction first so what does that mean that means I'll go up and I'll be like again sometimes putting out like a kind of I wouldn't say wacky energy but I can irreverent to energy you'd all be going up I'm not taking things very seriously I'm very revered I'm very illogical and a lot of the things I'm saying are largely nonsensical and and again that's just to show her that I'm contributing I'm here to make you laugh I'm here to improve your night in some small way at least make it more interesting and once you're interested and we've established that yes I'm it through again dropping statements of intent you know catted casually at first and then with more escalation as she responds well to it which will give me kind of like the door open to it to go deeper no pun intended I then at that point that's when I'll go for a pour so so again if you're just and that's if crucially important granted we don't want to go for a rapport first we go for attraction first then we get rapport once we've you know once she's accepted us as interesting or a potential hookup partner due to the fact that we've given value as opposed to leach value so yeah she's like okay this guy's cool let's keep talking to him once I get that then it's very important you cannot just keep up this fucking cartoon character you know a lot of people they get to some pressure with me is this like you know wacky wacky dude right but that guy's not gonna be successful that guy's not successful because they just can't take you seriously but like okay hahaha very funny okay where's where to the drope stop you're just a fucking cartoon character so yes it's very important to get attraction the bat by you know contributing in that in that fashion but at a certain point you got a short no I'm actually a real person - yeah I'm actually open you know I'm going up I'm like hey dude huh fuckin Obamacare this and add whatever you know whatever gibberish I'm spouting but then I'm like no action I'm also hey I'm Jeff I'm actually a real person so at a certain point you got to cut the cocky crap and you got to dial it back and perhaps the biggest skill in game as it were is realizing what the girls giving you emotionally and adjusting your behavior accordingly so again and why is this so important because the girl needs some sort of evidence right there needs to be some sort of demonstration that you in fact have an atonement to her subjective experience and you're not just there saying shit and doing shit blithely thinking you're awesome so many guys are doing that shit and all it takes is for one guy just so like yes I appreciate your perspective I get that you're a person and I'm I'm not only receptive to it I'm responsive to that so it's not just me talking at some girl hoping that she's gonna let me bang her it's me talking with a girl exploring her as a person and finding out if we have chemistry but as people and then moving things forward in a you know in a smooth methodical manner from there that makes it easy for her to go along and and decide to to be with you so yeah so again in a nutshell to recap yeah you want to go up fun and you want to you want to have a fun energy but at certain time you got it you got to keep it real you got to bring it real and shoulder that you're an actual real person - okay and when you don't do that it's quite off-putting and that's probably why you're doing these kinds of reactions all right so I want to take one more kind of like a more humorous one I suppose okay so let's do Timothy he asks what kind of cookies should I bake well I think baking you know it sounds like a great hobby cooking it can be a phenomenal hobby in terms of what kind of cookies you're baked I'm a pretty I have a I have a fucking sweet tooth you know I prefer like a sweet cocktail over a boozy you know like a more straight bitter boozy one I I prefer you know I love chocolate and shit like that so I but but the thing is to like I'm pretty you think of me as like this wild crazy fellow but in fact my tastes are a pretty vanilla like when I have sex it's just like it's pretty normal you know there's no there's no like crazy shit going on like it was like or what especially if they know my like persona of they read about me on you know whatever they'll be like well I thought I was gonna be this wild

hahaha with the lights up we can talking to the dark the darkness is my ally like Batman but no so let me kind of give you a couple little breakdowns at karaoke game uh so look I love karaoke cuz you can go there on a fucking Sunday Sunday night and there will be fucking people there okay cuz moat in a night where you have like most of other venues are dead you can go to karaoke there will be motherfuckers there why why would you who goes to karaoke aside from insane people basically they're there for like it's like a destination place right so there would be like a birthday party there will be like a going-away party there will be like an office party so and so's thing with the deal right there's going to be people there and then thing is they're not expecting to get hit on either but then there's Jeff up in the corner like a fat little spider ready to bounce on their ass now the thing with that you can't I find it's better to approach before you go up why do you think that is well because otherwise could we it can look trihard so if I go up and I like bust out some fucking shit and then I go down hey it's me the guy that you go didn't get to see how everyone liked me oh-ho right it's basically a form of qualification so I'll go up beforehand and I'll be like hey how's it going like oh hey boo boo boo bah you know I gave up a bit and then I go so are you singing I'm like yeah you know I'm not very good I'm kind of scared and you know and then you go up you're like whoa and they're like holy shit right so so FYI that's the way you do it this is how we do it yeah you may be wondering why I'm carrying this guitar well you see this is called booze guitar as I as noted earlier and it is a powerful talisman which can grant you many magical powers now I don't know if you guys saw me you know split up crawling about the clubs this week me and my students we're at various times wearing this sash do you guys did you guys see that it says let me call up a quick photo here it says sorry boys I'm taken  now now there's there's a story behind this much as there's a story with a lot of my shit you know what happens organically like a lot of people see is they think I like went to Party City and bought it or something not so I was back here in December and I was out here me and evil Jimmy came out here with my assistance and yada yada yada and we were running a boot camp and one night we were at access and we saw this bachelorette party you know some Bridal bullshit and we step to him fucking whore and that night we were in the zone right and evil Jimmy I grabbed the midget like I don't know if she wasn't a bona fide major but pretty fucking close you know a little person fucking like little taller than Peter Dinklage maybe and but way less cool and so I grabbed that one is immediate makeout I noticed she's fairly drunk which isn't surprising for someone that weighs that little but evil Jimmy grabs two of the girls and he's like making out with this one making out with this one and and like this motherfucker he was in the fucking zone he looked like a snake charmer or some shit right he was like like he's fingering this one talking to this one boom and everyone's around like oh my house how's this guy doing this right and so we kind of go we go over to their table and so evil Jimmy brings his over to the table and the bride's like who the fuck is this and he just goes happy family and brings the bride in and now she's like oh you know so she is one over now - he's so in the zone he actually was fucking super drunk and he like goes blue and he like him at their table he like knocks over a full carafe of cranberry juice it was like everywhere and the breads like what the fuck did it and he's like shut the fuck up and she for some reason she just like okay like I'm like damn like the zone right like what and he's like I'm gonna fuck both these girls yeah right and so he thinks it's going down and then one of them's like they have a little powwow and then one was like I gotta fix my purse hold on and she goes back to the table meanwhile he's like bleep a bed with the other one he turns around that chick's fucking gone like like I guess they had a talk and they're like who's going to fuck them so like this one so these goes one from Mexico City so we end up going back and mine the midget is so drunk she pukes so it's game over for me okay game over for me but then we decide is and then we all go to we all go to breakfast together at the the storied historic pepper mill and while we're there I'm just chatting I'm chopping it up with a girl and she's like you know she she thinks I'm cool I'm I win her over because I'm like fucking charming so she's like I like you you're cool and she's like you know what here take this and she gives me this sash she's like this belongs to the midget she's like but you know what if she knew I gave this to you she'd fucking kill me because it's like a memento from the you know the party or whatever she's like but that bitch puked on my fucking coat so fuck her and I'm like oh okay so I take it now the next night I go out to excess again and I put it on I like unfurl it and I put it on and as soon as I put it on it's like it's like plus five charisma like yeah and like bitches are like oh my gosh it you not within seconds they're like wow and then I coming up to it they're grabbing it but like what is this what am i god I'm getting all right like are you gay I'm like oh what the fuck you one of these duck dynasty motherfuckers are you fucking anti-gay marriage huh I'm like what the fuck girl there's a 21st century gays of the new blacks we don't make fun of homosexuals anymore  it's racist too she's like no no I'm just into dinner she's like so aren't you she goes so are you gay I look her up and down I go I am now she's like it's an old one it's an oldie but a goodie you know and then people are you know if they're asking me I got you're gay I'm like honey we're all a little gay like did it I'm like fucking on my sauce to some cunt ha ha ha right so it's like make out make out make out I pull that night I bang the girl and then I go meet the guys at immersion at the fucking Tuscany like this is taken you can see I have that glow about me that says you know I just had sex and my dreams came true so so anyway I thought okay maybe it's a fluke right maybe it's a fucking fluke so the next week I go home and I take it out to the DNA lounge on boot camp and the same fucking shit I throw it on and within like 10 minutes I'm sitting at the bottom like leaning against the bar and I've got this semicircle of women around me like laughing at everything I say they're pawing at it I might as well have had like a puppy or something in my arms like right now this is not a new concept okay this is something that has been around since the dawn of the fucking internet sexual predation community high running my juvenile classes on sexual predation what is this what is it what is the concept of play here peacock now what is peacock II what is the operative mechanism with peacocking its attention right it's going to give you attention now the attention in and of itself is not what makes it attractive it is your response to the attention are you able to handle the attention gracefully so for example I remember back in the day I used to wear all kinds of weird SH and I had this pink three-piece suit and if I wore that and wear with like bunny ears and shit and I'd wear that out and if I was in like a good mood or stayed or whatever that you want to call it if I was feeling good people would be like damn son look at this guy yeah man awesome suit bro like death of that right conversely if I was in kind of a low state or low mood it would be the opposite they'd be like my god look at this fucking idiot ha ha no I suit dude ha ha ha right so again it's all about how you handle it like so for example I have a saying like with this shit with the sash it's much like Joel nur Thor's hammer only the worthy may pick it up ok I put this shit on some Indian engineer and he's like this is this isn't like some hypothetical Indian engineer this is a like an actual dude like you know and he he puts it on and he was walking around the club he's like oh and then he comes up to me about Tim and so there's like serve Matt may I remove the sass sir may I remove the stache she's like begging me to let him take it off I kind of take it so may I remove the sash I'm like ok ok there's a just like a sash off right so the thing with this with this fucking shit booze guitar well let me put it this way if that's a +5 charisma this is like a plus 25 like dude this shit if you wear this we take it out to the park now you buy this crap here right now it's filled with some like sugary fucking concoction like I could probably drink this whole thing and like drive your mom home like and be totally fine but like if it when we take in a back home we dump a whole fifth of vodka in it and then the mixer of your choice in fact let me have to get as quick I'm always taking I'm always taking advice on this if you have this holds 88 ounces so basically they'll hold 1/5 of some spirit and then like 2 litres of something else so what would you put in vodka and lime watered-down vodka and lime oh you got to understand because the thing is you got to clean this later and you don't want it like fermenting that's why I got a new one because I like I left it in the van and forgot to clean it one night and then it's making it I went back and have like what do they call it shit from jail pruno in it like it had prison wine in it afterwards so we'll have with diamond dog Branca see if you get sick confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion and regionally generation inflation inflation and regionally generation inflation inflation inflation,kvDEXxjA9Q0

so what up what up it is your proverbial boy Jeffrey Allen and I'm here today in some kind of hotel room or something in San Francisco with a close personal friend of mine a man known only as Derek rst Derek aka the real motherfuckin D to paraphrase Eric Wright rest in peace we're both wearing cap shirts you're in town for what the just a little program you're running I came to visit the k-bay here am I allowed to say gay Bader I mean you know it is a rather festive here so yes that's gay as the day is long in June on the summer solstice but again have you said that like coincidentally I noticed I came in here to conduct this little interview session and we're both wearing cat shirts mine is actually a what appears to be some sort of mountain lion or cougar roaring at the Sun his is a basket an adorable basket full of kittens with a pot what appears to be a proud mama kitten and apparently you say this is also the shirt is glow-in-the-dark it does glow in the dark in fact I procured this in Hong Kong I was at a nighttime market in Hong Kong Hong Kong stoked by the way if you don't know no no yeah yeah is the Hong Kong you know you're and change ago I go there quite frequently but I've procured this then a fall of year and a half ago and there's such a glorious short about two of them yeah and I've warned them about the world and gotten compliments from women and gay men alike yeah most you know that's tweaked I was in Hong Kong again and I fought I saw this same fucking shirt the same fucking flea market they had the same shirt man and I'm like damn like you couldn't let an opportunity like that go by without purchasing two more so I now I have four identical yeah low in the dark basket of kittens shirts the dopest fuck no doubt they'll be a run on the market now now that we've discussed this no Tommy rush to halt you know I've um I remember this is something that you told me long ago we're just chit-chatting chopping up what have you and I remember you said you know wherever I go I'm always on the lookout for what you call pimp artefacts like wherever you go be on the lookout you see like a weird belt buckle or you see like a shirt that looks really interesting snap it up and always be on the lookout to like and this is one of the things that I often see on boot camps and I'm sure you see this too the guys come up in their sartorial sense their fashion sense is quite poor like I had this guy a couple months ago he dressed like a middle-aged father like he just looked like skate dad you know what I mean like that's what he looked like like a like a middle-aged suburban dad and he's trying to like pimp on these girls and shit cause I mean that's like my that's almost benign but then you'll also see sometimes where they just the clothes don't fit they look stupid as hell and it's difficult to tell these guys that on the permian I'm sure you have no qualms because you're kind of a more upfront blunt person but you know me like I'm like I'm trying to weigh the pros and cons of telling this guy on the bootcamp you look like shit you look terrible because like it could make us put him in his head or something he can't fix it right then and there you know so maybe you at the end of the night you tell them to maybe try it to come tomorrow with a little more stylish clothing or something but so how do you deal with that what a guy was like poor fashion on the program hey yo look boot camp with me is very tough love I am very nurturing of these guys like I want them to fucking succeed man and like I know you feel this way to you're fucking your og or serious about it and I tell them from the beginning in this song I believe you said years ago is like we could have called a day camp for little bitches I couldn't name the program day camp for little bitches but we chose to name it boot camp yeah yeah if you're gonna come on my program you gonna come fuck with us man like I'm Derrick boot camp you don't get what you want you get what you need man and I don't give a fuck about anybody short-term feelings I don't give a fuck about my own short-term feelings I don't care how I feel today or tomorrow or next week couldn't care less man I don't care about some fucking dudes short-term feelings but what I do care very deeply about is what are their long-term outcomes whatever results can help that guy get I don't take any joy I'm not the type of guy that really likes to insult other people there I'm pretty cooperative collaborative guy in a lot of ways I don't want to bully anybody I don't want to assault anybody but it'd be negligent for me not to tell them the things that would actually help them get results so yeah I have to have them sock weird conversations sometimes of like you know man tell me about this insurance salesman appearance that you're yeah I'm going for here or let help me understand who's your target market that this is going to appeal to you know yeah and a lot of them just don't understand it I met that's the thing that they just it's outside the reality they just simply do and that's why they're there and it's interesting what you said we call it boot camp for a reason very much as a military connotation to it but one thing I've noticed and I've been doing this for 16 years I I noticed more recently I don't know if it's just I'm getting a little older or whatever I think I lean on that sergeant asshole persona on the boot camp a bit less these days like yeah there's still times when I'm like private dirted or you know yelling in their face and and really crawling up their ass so to speak figuratively kept light a fire under their ass but then there's other times that I realized I'm not there to be a bully for the sake of it I'm just trying to leverage the best outcome and sometimes that'll I noticed I don't think I have like a meltdown which could be good for him short term like sometimes I'll send a guy in when I like he's approaching wrong but he's running up on the girl all weird and I just let him do it because I want him to feel the pain or this is a better one where he's in there and he's not taking it to the romantic level and you know it's not going to go anywhere and my assistant will be like we should pull him out of there it looks like it's not going anywhere I'm like no I want him to feel it shift and go pear-shaped I want him to feel the not even disdain but to feel the friendship like here we go from potentially romantic when he goes up oh I'm being approached this is unusual he's kind of cute I'm into this and then she's like oh he's just gonna talk about the weather for 15 minutes and then see it become like hopelessly friendzone then one more permutation is the bastard that he's make out make out make out he's groping her she's squeezing him to someone who's naive it looks great and you know he's like I'm gonna get through the body hitting it it's gonna happen we're gonna get done tonight it's happening and you know you see it in the distance and you see them the make out went two seconds too long yeah Kenny squeezed her just a little too much a little too much cherishing and they're a little too much neediness and that fucking squeeze for the embrace yeah you know I see it in a hot second I'm sure you must as well that just like nope you lost it right there yeah it's not fun now it's something he needs and he he doesn't want it he needs it if he would have pulled away first if he would have led the girl instead of kissing more if he would you were to you know come meet my friends let's grab a drink I like this song come dance with me if you were taking that leadership position instead of fucking staying in one spot in going for affection affection affection affection you only get so much affection staying on that one spot man you gotta move the fucking girl if you don't take it to it you know most girls you know surprise surprise most girls prefer to have sex in a somewhat private location not in the fucking Club yeah Joe this might be shocking to a lot of people listening to this or it maybe even to you but I've never had sex in a in a public bathroom yeah he's like more like a real okay yeah I'm old fashioned I have sex in a band you know that call me just an old fuddy-duddy but I fucking a van no I just I don't know I've never done it I've always pulled to like either begin the van or I'll give him bathrooms around the world yeah it started really shocked to know that yeah it is kind of I'm almost kind of shocked to say it out loud or to realize that so I don't know maybe bucket lists and who knows yeah this weekend this kind of brings me into what I wanted to address as the subject of this little discussion which is the idea that you know we just talked about a couple things that are unattractive qualities that women find unattractive is either again neediness or perhaps just poor fashion sense but I think that on a more fundamental level there are certain qualities that a man can embody or or have just as a part of his character that women just find repulsive and you know I'd like to kind of brainstorm here and sort of pinpoint for our wonderful viewers listeners here what those are and I'd say them for me the first one is you know let's kind of touch on that like expanding that a little more is neediness I think we can both agree that's probably the number one most unattractive quality of all is meatiness now what does that mean to you like again a lot of how what does that mean how how do I know if I'm being needy yeah I would just categorize that in a macro level it just kind of any bitch-ass shit it's gonna give you punished man like you can't go around doing some bitch-ass shit and expect to have some champion ass outcomes so if you're a type of guy that wants to have a champion out you know consistently and reliably you got to be engaged in champion behaviors so what is it a champion behavior versus if some bitch-ass shit behaviors it's like the guy that wants to fight make out make out make out and you know he needs that extra a moment of attention or validation I don't need any more validation from a woman bro I don't need another bit of fucking validation from a woman I have a statistically significant sample for the Nerds out there you know that for for less nerdy inclined it means I fucked enough women the I don't fucking need a woman's attention or validation I was literally thinking about just today I just got to go do me man I just got to go do some gangster shit yeah I got to go be a fucking champ in a hero and a winner if you did that if you lived a life of like a you know pursuit of education kept your body in decent shape you know kept your fucking brain working sharp and then just got up and did some shit whatever it is man you ain't got to be we in here talking about you cannot be a tech billionaire or some fucking actor or some shit the ink I do crazy shit and go fuck bitches and vans or bathrooms around the world like fucking Jeff Frey that's a that's a special case man but you know if you if you're just getting up doing your thing you know you might be an excellent musician you might be you know some artistic type person that you're fucking musician or a fucking athlete or something or maybe you're just a fucking super nerd it ain't gotta be like musician or athlete in like a sexy way maybe you're a fucking nerdy computer dude but you just you know you own that identity and you're really good at what you do and you're proud of yourself but cutting through the shit and really getting to the core of it it's like the woman can't be with a man that needs something from her you gonna be constantly punished for any sort of neediness you've got to want her but on your terms and you got to know that your terms that you got the value that you're gonna do more for her than she's gonna do for you and she knows that and you know that and she knows that you know that she knows that you know that she knows that you're the shit yeah yeah she's probably you can get more out of the relationship than you are man if you live in that way you ain't got no reason that you would be undoing some bitch's shit wouldn't you just telling her like hey this is what's up this is who I am this is what I'm doing I think you really cut through all of it like that you're gonna be like live a life that you're really excited to be living it invite her along for that adventure and if you don't want to come that ain't your girl man no convincing no persuading live the life that you want to live invite her along for the adventure she got to opt in or opt out if she opts out that ain't my girl I don't spend a moment try to convince her persuade her to do some shit that ain't in her nature she ain't gonna change my shit and I ain't gonna fuckin argue with her long-term beacause management problems when you do that yeah you have a fucking lifetime of fucking misery and management problems when you fucking pretend to be something you're not do some bitch-ass shit on the front end pretend to be somebody or not that the wrong people into your life then they find out later all that ain't who this - it is then Ian who he really is and they're resentful and you're resentful and they're contemptuous and you're contemptuous and then you break up and you know what most suckers do they go repeat that shit again they go live that cycle again they can't delay the gratification yeah yeah yeah they're like I'm gonna I'm the front now even though they know it's gonna bite him in the ass later but it feels good now to put on that front so I can get the pussy or whatever the case may or get the validation even for that matter but I think kids you know we're kind of more mature guys at this point but I think when you know younger people listening to this might be like well they're so indoctrinated by you know the looks money status thing and look those things are all great for your personal enjoyment personal life enjoyment but they're like I need to embody this again the musician or the tech millionaire archetype in order to make women attracted to me and they can't fathom that just being super comfortable in your own skin and being on your path whatever that means for you is truly what's more attractive and I even like knew this at an abstract level just from like learning pickup and stuff but it was never really I remember the first time that it was just driven home to me was when I had this student it was an older gentleman he was in his mid-50s obese weird glasses a push-through mustache dressed like kind of like an insurance salesman I asked him I said oh so you're the student so what's your goal for the weekend he's like I only like to have sex with very attractive 20 to 25 year old women I'm like oh well we don't want to be outcome dependent but we'll do our we'll do our best haha right and then lo and behold though this guy I've never seen anything like it he was so comfortable in his own skin and just like a really charismatic dude mhm and he hooked up with a really hot 27 year old like and I was like damn he's like he left with the girl and then the next day you know we met up and I said so what happened he said I went to my home and I made love with her I was like oh shit but I was like dude if this like fat old guy can be that Center and just find the girl that's super into that and super attracted that what is my excuse there is no excuse so that was kind of what really opened my eyes up to that to begin with but then I think furthermore and like you said I was thinking about the same thing today you know we could go you and I we can get laid whenever we want like it sounds obnoxious to say that but like literally if I want to get laid and summers off I'm more focused like on the past you must have been focused on like health and like finances and starting like you know new aspects of the business and something like that but you start to think after it's been awhile what you haven't gone out and sometimes like maybe I don't know if I still haven't then you go out you're like boom and it you just get laid you like oh yeah right this is with me forever now so there's no need for me to be like chasing validation like that but what's interesting to and this is something that I'm always taught when I talk about you when I reference you know you to others Derrick is a very uncompromising individual in terms of like he's not running around trying to make every girl like him he's looking for the one girl in the club power you know who thinks he's amazing he's not trying to like finagle a bunch of people who kind of like them and then maybe you know use some trickery lines to get her back home and then defuse a bomb for three hours as he like tries to persuade her to hook up and all this stuff it's like know if you go back like if the girl goes back with you or me it's because they like this what we're throwing down there's no facade to it it's what you see is what you get I'm like the story that always stands out for me is we were in excess you're talking this very beautiful girl by anyone's standards really you know a nine whatever you want to call it and she said something to the effect of how she like enjoyed socialist economic policies and you were like you need to remove yourself from my presence and she's like ah ha ha very funny because she's quite attractive and she can't even fathom that someone would reject him for something like that and if he's like you're like what don't you understand get the fuck out of here now she's I get you like it runs off kind of like all snarky because again she can't even understand what just happened now a lot of guys hear that and they might think you're doing that as like some kind of creepy one can take away bro ya dick no he's like genuinely wants her to go I'll often say things that I find amusing that the girl doesn't like but if she leaves I know I'm for some not for others and I've internalized I know paradoxically once you actually internalize that mentality you become you have chemistry with way more people oddly enough I think because you're not this defensive little guy trying to make them like you you try to pretend to be something you're not man how the fuck you're gonna be like the best to be in somebody else man like you know bu now some fucking tard alright sometimes I'm plowing out there it's gonna hear like oh just be my best me just be me well look man you know if you're if you're currently doing like nothing with your life if you be here engaging and nothing but looser behaviors you know you're not you don't even like yourself man like this is a manifestation of somebody who doesn't even like themselves so a key element to what I said a few minutes ago that's a prerequisite for the sort of lifestyle the the Jeff just explained is that you know if you want to have a true sense of abundance if you want to know that like like no hot bitches like me I don't even have self doubt about it and I'm not trying to be cocky I just did this for 17 years and well that's a great I was literally just about to say that second quality that women find repulsive is self-doubt so number one is neediness number two is self-doubt where you don't and use this is something that you said long ago that I internalized if you don't understand the value proposition for her how the hell is she gonna understand it like if you don't know it's entirely on a man to convey the value proposition you ain't leading the relationship to her best option is to lead her ass away from you if these women were fuckin obsessed if they were just like desperate to go find some fucking pussy to find some in some fucking cunt loser they don't need you bro they don't need me or Jeff they don't need you they got plenty indecisiveness oh yeah they got plenty of fuckin uncertainty in her life already if she just wanted to be what a pussy she'd go be a lesbian man so I I saying it to be humorous I do think it's humorous it is generally but it also happens to be true it's right if she wanted more pussy in her life man she'd go be a lesbian she is not outlook for a man that beings more uncertainty and more indecisiveness and if you want to ever in your fucking life if you want ever have like a true sense of abundance that's maintainable sustainable it just burnt in and it's there is you have to be so delighted with your life you got to wake up happy with who you are delighted with who you are knowing that it ain't for everybody not everybody's gonna like you man if you want everybody to like you you ain't gonna do shit you ain't gonna have a girl worth havin any quality girl is gonna flee you want to keep on the the topic for a moment of things that are repulsive or alienating to women is like if she sees you're pretending to be something you're not she can go be with somebody else man and he might be lower value than you he might have legitimately like lower education lower income some guy who's like short or fat or dumber and broker than you and she rather be with a shorter fatter Dumber broker guy who's comfortable in his own fucking skin and happy with who he is then some dude that's like smarter taller richer etc that is pretending to be something or not or is doing that from a place of insecurity well she feels that little bitty insecurity or indecisiveness you're done right off the approach know these things before the approach they do not consciously sense it yes that would she becomes subconsciously over that let me know when you're open started when she became subconsciously aware of your exist on understand this they think that like when the woman's in the venue if they can like lurk in her vicinity until they screw up the courage to the approach they know you're there maybe they don't see it but they feel that presence of self-doubt and the thing is the guy who has that self-doubt it takes him a while to again get the courage up and get the nerve to do the approach because he doesn't feel that he's more valuable than the interruption he's causing and then so he might not even approach at all for one and if he does it's gonna be like weeks you still didn't Jeffy but feel like I'm interrupting yeah you're fuckin interrupting bro yeah you're fucking interrupting if you don't think that what you have to say it's important enough to interrupt her guess what her default outcome doesn't include you in her life man her default life plan does not include you and if you're not willing to interrupt her for the better I can't interrupt like a beggar if you interrupt like a bomb looking for a coin man she's gonna treat you like a bomb if you interrupt like you have something important to say you're bringing value to the situation that like like like oh damn like my life would ha be better if our spending time with this dude if you interrupted with a with that urgency and insincerity of like probably your life would be better if your spending time with me well she could Emma can at least take you seriously alright I don't mean she's gonna like you or not like you but should at least hear you out and take you seriously in this like hopper Jodie and I always say that every time you hover Chotu girl this phenomenon that you're described in jail is disgusting and perverse behavior king of lurking around and hovering around or other men get in there I say every time you hover Chotu girl a player down in hell sheds a tear yeah he does alright so third quality I want to touch on and this is maybe a little controversial these days is that again women find repulsive it's just weakness now when I say weakness I mean the opposite of like let me say like masculine what do you what do you typically think of a traditionally masculine like again this toxic masculinity stuff aside maybe that's a thing whatever that's not the point here but just weakness in general like generally matter scene it has a kind of rugged sort of physically stronger and not like I guess afraid of getting a little beat up by like say the weather or inconsequential yeah you don't want hot bitches Mon you know the type of man that a hot bitch wants that a beautiful woman wants you know the type of man that she wants she wants the same type of man that you would want to be your business partner she wants exactly the same type of man that you would want to have on your team in a fucking athletic event she wants the same type of man that you would like to have alongside you as is your fucking faithful loyal companion like if you were in a tough environment like a fucking lost in a jungle with scary animals yeah she'd like some guy that's a fucking Green Beret or Navy SEAL or a motherfucker that'll kill shit and bring back meet somebody that can protect the fucking tribe and defeat the enemy the type of man who's like I would never want as my business partner or my wingman or anyone tangentially in my peer group I would never allow someone near me would be offended by the idea of protect our team to feed our enemy anybody who'd be offended by protect our team to feed our enemy fuck that guy a woman want that either man like she wants the guy of the fucking hacks like a guy she wants the guy of this like you know mentally resilient physically dominant mentally Vasili in Canada mentally resigned accomplished shit and overcome obstacles man that's the thing I mean we're like I'm not like the strongest dude out there but I'm not gonna shy away from things that are physically uncomfortable or from like even some sort of like confrontational thing I'm not going back oh my heavens no I saw something I'm read it the other day of all places where this woman was like this here's a situation like I feel like I broke up with my boyfriend over this should I feel bad like they were getting mugged and the boyfriend just like threw her in front and ran away and then like hid in a park and then he came back he's like well I was calling the cops I was calling the cops meanwhile the guy like took her shit and like you know fucked off didn't harm her but she was like you tonight after seeing that I just can't be with this guy now obviously you're not gonna be in situations like that every day but it's that mentality of life I was held at gunpoint in Africa you know us held it actually four times but one of them was quite serious ice held at gunpoint where a man's point an ak-47 at me and I told him put that fucking thing away now obviously I don't but I explained to him I worked for the US government if you accidentally shoot me with that fucking thing your piece of shit village you grew up in is gonna be bombed it won't exist in two days put that fucking thing away I said we're leaving now and there were several hostages and the girl that I was with she and I were released yeah no one else was she and I were released from the situation's I explained to them that basically this a bad idea for them to do that she told me later of all the crazy ated things that we've been involved in or crazy adventures she said well that's the time I thought you were gonna die I thought you were gonna die there and I was already thinking in the quarter they're gonna do to me after they shoot him yes but you know what she is really happy about the outcome because you're not taking hostage and then beyond that you're like maybe again maybe you're nothing to be like some super jack dude but then take a basic care of like your physicality especially as you get older I think so many of my life contemporaries just kind of slide into this shapeless like almost womanly mass you know what I mean and to be fair many of these are like dads and they kind of don't give a shit anymore but you know maybe the divorce is coming down the line for them to you know like they just kind of become the shapeless formless we're guy yeah you know who also dresses like shit so taking care of that I'd say another one and this is kind of the controversial it's worth touching on that one for a minute you know okay uh you and I are you know I'm forty yeah I'm 43 and I can lift I was in the gym well we could go ten days ago I was in the gym with my homeboy Brandon Carter shout-out to Brandon Carter BB's in Brandon and I were in the gym together in New York and I'm doing leg presses you know lake sled I had a thousand and eighteen pounds I got it up seven times at age 40 yeah in kilos that's like four hundred and sixty five kilos yeah you know I'm you know there's this guys they're stronger I don't know I'm not a bodybuilder you know yeah yeah I go to the gym I go lift some heavy shit it's like a priority it's not my goal to be like you know I'm not I'm not winning mr. Olympia or something my goal is not to get injured in the gym now but still I'm in the fucking shit but I'm going for it yeah yeah I don't care if I got a headache I don't care if I got a fever I don't care I just trust fucking thirteen time zones I'm still going at the gym on schedule so you know just just an amount of self-care like that of like again I'm not trying to be a big bodybuilder yeah but each forty I could still lift over a thousand pounds there's a lot of guys out there that you know they just think he'd care of them like you said a formless mass it like like a like a womanly shape almost to it like that's kind of like booth like these rodent like knows nipple man boobs that come out like I've all been really painting a picture of the rodent nose man boobs yeah yeah you got to have a decent like it goes back to what we said man is you don't let me if you don't love yourself how was she supposed to love you man if you don't like yourself if you don't care about your outcomes you in investing yourself how you expecting a beautiful woman to invest in you how is she supposed to perceive you as her best option when you mayn't even feet in yourself like you're a great option you got to take care of yourself man you know similar on along those lines I say that another like the next kind of characteristic that women find repulsive is I guess what's the opposite of being self-reliant helpless pussy like I like being like helpless right so you should be able to figure things out to solve problems to make things happen like if your car breaks down do you know what to do are you like oh my what's going on are you like okay I'm gonna change the tire I mean obviously that's like a very facile kind of example but you know if you get locked like for example if you're I were to be dropped into a random municipality that we never been to before and you said you got to get here by this time we'll figure it out yeah you know what I mean we're not like if you have no money no ID like and like you got to get from here to here we'll figure something out you know you don't know the language you'll figure something out because we're self-reliant individuals I think that we developed that for me personally it was from like traveling the world basically oftentimes like with no backup yeah I think a gift that in an odd way that neither one of us would have asked for okay but in an odd way I think a gift that both you and I were given as we both had like the other tumultuous childhoods you know my waitress yeah I'd say quite below average childhoods that yeah the the average American would would think the heavens and any God they might believe in that they didn't grow up like me or you now there's other people that had worse problems you know I seen third-world poverty and I seen what real poverty or real despair looks like and you know I take compared to that we had it you know pretty pretty good but you know we certainly had some some American despair you know some us miss mere and I think you money focus on lives I had to be like the adult in my household since I was like 10 right and I've lived by myself since I was 19 I haven't had a parental figure in my house or anybody relief since I was 19 man I just had to solve problems I had to learn early to solve problems exactly and I think that's something that you and I have got people say how are you good to be are you CPM well first of all I don't even think of myself anything like an icy pimp I don't think that way at all is just like well how do I make myself more resourceful how can I make myself more useful to others that's what's gonna help me solve problems you know and then would be that we've already an attractiveness to Whitman I think I think the absolute sexiest thing about you or me is that that ingenuity you know where another guy sees they think oh it's a problem oh she's giving me you should test for you know congruence test I heard the guys at rst talked about this rst Chafee said this is a congruence test well yeah motherfucker like this issue out there for busting some crippled dudes balls or some old days yeah if a girl is giving you a fucking push back is like huh on some level she either has already made a firm decision that she really doesn't like you and she'd like you to go away and you're too fucking Dahmer or oblivious to read the social queue or you know equally likely in many cases if you had any social tact up to this point probably she fucking likes you bro and she's fucking feeling you out it's like I was this good serious yeah is this guy real and you know the what a lot of people look as an obstacle is like oh she's she's making in front of me now what a lot of people look at and obstacles like do these the so-called shit test or congruence test is like this is an opportunity to demonstrate your fucking resourcefulness your brilliance your we had your ingenuity or your ability to fucking you know solve problems and get shit done man and yeah it's a number high level of game man I'd love to hear your input on this Jeff is like I really think like top-level pimping high level game game high level game is you know you I put actively elicited shit tests I'd go out of my way to make the girl shit test me so I can then fucking just be me and her presence in like instead of like spending hours or weeks or months to figure out like oh this is how this guy is she has a really good sense in five minutes of like oh this is how this guy is if an interaction goes past like four or five or six minutes she has a good sense of like she's like she likes me I have compliance I have buy-in now we're gonna go do whatever Derek wants to do and she's gonna be cool about it yeah I mean that self-reliance - I gave the example like fixing a tire navigating the city right you could even be something like navigating some sort of bureaucratic process like you know legal ease or something like that but it's just being self-reliant in general and I think almost kind of hand-in-hand with this the next kind of unattractive quality would be a lack of ambition right like just a person who has no zero ambition in life that's called a loser let's go yeah yeah like here I'm not even saying that the guy needs to be successful yet but at least have ambition and be like doing something to move towards that like just the guy who's again my mom bring the chicken ten D's in the basement Mountain Dew video games and that's like your sole ambition life because I don't know maybe he's given up and B it's too hard maybe he doesn't think it's possible whoever who knows too hard stay down there bro stay down there yeah I mean just again zero ambition it's not sin not saying you want to be like the next tech billionaire or anything like that but at least have some sort of aspiration to better your station in life whatever that means to you whether it's spiritually mentally physically emotionally case-mate financially you know just don't be this sort of schlub ya manually if you put off by that by the way if you put off by the jerk so that's the loser I might be if you think you have if you think you might be a loser bro you probably are one if you have to ask if you've got on your vibe if you're experiencing uncertainty around this question you probably are one man and just stay down there bro like look man Jeff and I would you know something he and I both like we like young girls like young pretty girls man and like you know don't worry but we're gonna take care of those girls for you those girls that you could have had the beautiful girls that would have been happy to hop in you're a bad man man just got them girls man his fuckin women young women his back is strong he's gonna fucking kick her all of them he's doing them fucking deadlifts and squats and shit fuckin don't worry man there don't you worry them girls are gonna be taken care of we got this shit man so you just stay in your mommy's basement you know have your mommy be new then fucking chicken tenders and suck your little thumb and your safe space and shit is cool man you got this copper for you bro you gotta cover just stay there man stay right there so have a little ambition you know don't be just like a schlub another one that I find is a major turnoff for a lot of women is just a guy who's like a harmless nice fellow right a harmless fellow and or boring boring like a boring predictable basic bitch a basic bitch the male version of a basic a basic bro right so I think for you and I and most of us are good at this stuff there's an element of mystery you know what I mean where they're like okay there's more than meets the eye with this guy I'm not sure what's up yet but it's not just like okay I get it this was just like another bro and a fucking Patagonia vest you know it's either be an adventure yeah it's gonna be an adventure exactly she knows it she can smell it she can taste her she knows me I spent time with this motherfucker like I don't know what he's likely to do is gonna be an adventure it's gonna be an adventure and there's a safety component which we touched on earlier is like this guy's resourceful enough this is gonna be a crazy adventure and yet I feel comfortable that when some frictions come up and they will when some frictions come up when some troubles come up dudes gonna be able to take care of that shit so I she gets the emotional satisfaction having a fucking a wild crazy fucking adventure in her life an adventurous awesome lifestyle and also the safety of a resourceful fucking G she knows like I this dude's gonna be able to take care of it most any nonsense that could come up it's got that - so it's like a roller coaster you know where you know like okay this has been reviewed by engineers their safety measures in place but it's gonna be this exhilarating ride versus the guy who's just kind of this edgy guy but who's also doesn't have that safety element is more like the carnival ride that's probably gonna like have bolts coming off and it's gonna go flying and like murder ten people you know a lot of people try to feign that yeah they don't have the social calibration or intellectual resourcefulness that you or I would or that a lot of our clients do for that matter let me make that clear like I don't when I say that you know Jeff and I are doing this or that look man you know I'm just some fucking dude from a small town that grew up in a below average family and it sucked yeah I was just sufficiently dissatisfied by my childhood that I chose to take some steps to make it better I found good mentors you know where do I find them I read books I did a lot of self-help programs I spent nine years in universities I went to nerd Ivy League school later on after dropping out of high school earlier in my life I've had kind of both experience of society I don't mean to position myself like you know like oh I was born better or madly better do I think I'm better than some people absolutely because I earned that place in the world because I did things that other people wouldn't do to put myself in a better situation however however I think there's a lot of guys here listening to this that I hope you're inspired by that that like wherever you're at right now wherever you feel like you're a dude you can make your life a lot better you could be a lot better off than you currently are and like those are the guys that I get really excited to work with I think Jeff feels the same satisfaction the those are the guys that I really enjoy working with as a guy who's like yeah you know what dude I dealt with some fucked up shit too and like can you show me a better way I'm willing to go take I'm actually willing to execute and do the shit that you'd ask me you showed me a better way I could have a higher quality life I could actually go be like actually attractive to fucking dope-ass girls they're like both beautiful and like fun to be around and would treat me with a decency and respect yeah I'd love to help guys with that you know I do that you could have you're a better financial situation yeah I have the desperation of growing up on welfare and feeling like shit I like to help guys with that too you know so I think that's something that's misconstrued sometimes about you were Jennifer yeah so oh you know he just you know you know I've had a comment on I remember where I read a fucking comment somewhere once I was talking about it was the interview that you and I did it was an interview that you and I Phoebe's did and some guys like you know why do you guys always got a beat on the guy on the bottom it's already rock-bottom I was like dude look I don't know who was it more rock bottom yeah man who the fuck's childhood was more rock bottom than yours or mine that's exactly the type of person that you need if you're one of those people that you're feeling fucking down or loathed like do i mock that guy a little bit absolutely but I also was that guy yeah that's exactly the guidance you need is like you don't need to be coddled like a bitch dude you need somebody to tell you quit pretending to be a bitch and get your shit and order and step it up man yeah a girl in house how the fuck is that dope asph I was the hottest girls supposed to go with some fucking guy that like just thumbs loved as you say is like yes you got a no not in a cocky way you got to know from a place of like deep sincerity that like I'm not perfect but I Know Who I am I know what I want I know what my values are I know what my goals are and I'm gonna go out here and do that shit and not everybody's gonna like it but the ones who do they're gonna love it they're gonna get on board and ride that train man they're gonna dance to OPM's music yes I guess that kind of brings me to the next one this is almost the final one I think would be a not attractive quality is being like a slave to society like a rule follower and look rules are great for a reason you know you don't drive on the left side of the road I understand them to an extent but like an excessive rule follower where you're like like you know don't be loud in public or things like that you know versus guy who has a lot of freedom and it's maybe willing to kind of bend the rules here and there what are your thoughts on that you know like a devil-may-care attitude you know a person that has real integrity is someone that they have a lot of rules in their brain they have a lot of rules of what is an appropriate or inappropriate behavior and the og pimp Frederick Wilhelm Nietzsche touched on this topic in several of his books you know thus Spoke Zarathustra and many others that come oh yeah genealogy of morals is the key book here the key topic of the entire book genealogy of morals is exactly that is like where do your morals come from of what value are your values and that's a touchy topic for some people some people don't want to question their value is the so called like social conventions or societal norms some of those are in your best interest absolutely it's best if you don't go around like shitting in public places and setting shit on fire man like you're gonna have a better life if you could avoid those couple things if you get nothing else from this interview I hope that you stop shitting in public places or setting shit on fire or arbitrarily and just that would help you have a lot better life you know really knowing like why do I value the things I value why are those things important to me and that also allows you to discern like what are the social norms or social conventions that I'm following that are I'm doing so to my detriment yeah stop that shit immediately like overly in Brawl to social conditioning like I yeah like that's a better way to put it like they're it's they're not making their own decisions they're simply accepting these things as sacrosanct yeah you're not peeing if you're if you're behaving that way it's Jeff to subscribe you're not being a more authentic human it's a lack of identity it's a lack of authenticity you being a fake-ass bitch and you're too dumb to know it and these are very touchy things and I get a lot of people are behaving that way and everybody has blind spots so I have plenty of blind spots Jeff has plenty of blind spots so I'm never gonna be a paid fucking golfer bro cuz I don't give a fuck about golf yes you don't want me to be your fucking high surgeon bro it ain't gonna work out good can it gonna be good you know but there are a few things that I am quite excellent at and there's a few niches a business that I'm quite a legitimate subject matter expert and I could help a lot of people I've done very well for myself there's some areas like pick up where Jeff and I are like absolute subject matter experts we've helped a lot of people around the world in the areas of creating wealth or creating abundance women living an abundant lifestyle in general I do consider myself a legitimate subject matter expert in that area and I'm living a hell of a lot more of an authentic and free life and most anyone I know most anyone that's ever lived and I that sounds like a bold claim I believe it's true you know what what can I tell you about that topic it's like really Annalise I'm not telling you how to live take a note here I'm not telling you how to live I'm just telling you like do analyze why where are some of these thoughts coming from there are some of these behavioral patterns coming from and like are these things actually going to help you get the outcomes that you want live whatever kind of life you want to live man I would never tell somebody what kind of life they should live nobody knows that better than you in Econ that's called a subjective marginal utility curve that no one knows what the best body is and your subjective marginal utility curve than you do man you know you got to pick that spot nobody else can do it for you however dude do that don't do it by a default don't do it by you know the default setting and the society told you is going to be valuable to you think deeply like what's the shit you want what are the outcomes you want and what does the social pressure you're gonna have to tolerate to do that have you seen anybody be fucking successful with this this shit Jeff have you seen one fucking person be amazingly successful that like attracting hot women and sustainably dating them who wasn't capable of tolerating a lot of social pressure no I haven't seen one I don't think of one no its concomitant with a lot of social pressure good job if you won't tolerate social pressure if you're too pussy to fucking have with little confrontation here and there and deal with some pushback wherever that might come from if you're not willing to deal with that man that's cool bro but you know somebody else is gonna get a lot of rewards that you could have had if you were just like a little bit more thoughtful about who you are what you want a little bit more tolerant to like being in tough situations like those are the things that let a girl know like deeply in her heart like give her that twinge down by her pussy hole that let her know like this guy is not fucking around straight not one of these other guys like I need to fuck with him I need to be what a man like that I need a man like that to be my ally in life yeah because most people women included or they're in thrall to that social additional as Owen used to say walking through life in a daze in this like walking days whether it's like in reaction to things and these reactions are dictated by not only social conditioning but emotional reactions like knee-jerk emotional responses biological imperatives and so when they encounter someone who's I wouldn't say completely free from that but more free from that than most what's the number one rule of game whatever you feel they feel so they're gonna be like well I get a whiff of feeling like this by being around this person so maybe if I were to hang around him more I could feel like that too right so in many ways I think you know developing that freedom can be the most attractive characteristic of all because it's the opposite of neediness that's what that is it's the opposite of needing it to work is being free confident in as you said your own rules for living life and as long as you're living up to those you can feel good about going up there because you you feel self assured you understand the value proposition you're bringing to her etc etc and ultimately it's putting you at what we call the cause and of things in the environment where you're actually more on the driver's seat of your life as opposed to the effect end of things where shit's just happening and you're in reaction to it constantly if you need a girl you can never have her you'll end up dating exactly the quality of girl that you're willing to walk away from you need to want her but not need her need to want her but only conditionally you need to have her but only on reasonable terms only on your terms and they have to be reasonable terms and if she isn't bought into that it's not your girl get rid of her go find another one immediately don't waste your time so yeah man I think that about wraps it up this is as usual been quite an illuminating conversation I always enjoy having you on the channel so thanks for coming on if people are interested to hear more about your wisdom on this topic these subjects where could they find out more you could add me on IG or YouTube just search for rst Derek you find some dope-ass shit on my website artisty Derek calm yo man you're working on your new program careers my master you too this is gonna help these guys solve a lot of these problems need a lot more clarity in their lives where do they find info for them and they can check that at a charisma mastery com get on the VIP entrances to be notified of new developments and when it's going to come out like I said you know a lot of these topics that we've been touching on here these areas are kind of like abstract concepts kind of nebulous difficult to internalize so with this project I really wanted to get to where the rubber meets the road so to speak and develop some of the best exercises to actually develop that sort of elusive quality that we call charisma so I'm pretty excited about it again you can check it out at charisma mastery comm get on at the FPS list if you would like to do so having said all that again thanks for being here wonderful times hope to see you again soon and pimp it up as they say Tippin is real camping is real but it certainly is not easy but it's well worth the effort so this has been Jeff and Derek and we'll see you next time,lCR0QTdSJfA
hey hey hey what up it's your proverbial boy Jeffy and today I want to talk to you about the anomaly effect and that is the effect which is the result of taking specific strategies in field that are not part of your genuine personality and implementing them without implementing the natural elements that someone who naturally use them would have what does it all so I'm out here Miami South Beach on the beach and before we crack into this little dissertation I'd like to take a moment to remind you to please like and subscribe to my channel here if you like getting real talk brought to you every Tuesday every Taco Tuesday all right now having said that let's begin in Australia back in the day when bunny rabbits were introduced to the continent they very very quickly covered the entire countryside why because there were no natural predators so what we had here was a foreign element introduced and since there were no natural checks to deal with it that is there were no rabbit predators to eat the little bunny rabbits and you know and keep their population in check what actually happened was they proliferated now here's another example using modern cropping techniques based in genetic engineering modern farmers can run the same crop three times per year instead of different crops each trimester as is the natural traditional way and as a result bugs infiltrate certain species became major pests only when continuous planting of corn became practiced in the Midwest so basically what you have is since the same plant growing all year the bugs can multiply much more efficiently than if a different plant was introduced every four months because their ideal habitats always there so they can simply multiply and multiply now what we have here these are anomalies that are the result of non natural introduction of various elements so how does this relate to social interaction well when you intentionally learn a new technique well you might be inclined to implement it in a somewhat exaggerated fashion so to give you a couple examples here one example would be cocky humor right cocky humor it's designed to attract but it does very little to gain rapport in many cases so you get the results you know a pure cocky interaction is gonna yield you someone who will do you right there but won't return your friggin phone calls a day later actually scratch that they won't return your phone calls a minute later huh right it's that it's that often times that exaggerated that pronounced now many times using a pure cocky style maybe because of like there was time constraints at the end of the night or something my friends and I had girls walking out of the club and they were totally into the idea of going with us right arm in arm with us smiling saying yeah let's do this but then they they flaked on this so called instigate because we would leave for one minute say to handle coat check or something like that I once actually had an incident where I met a woman at the bar who was on a date and I used a pure cocky obnoxious style and she wanted to hook up with me right there in the venue literally while her date was sitting in the other end of the club you know she was literally that down even though I did absolutely nothing but this is just like obnoxious teasing for 10 minutes well I didn't hook up with her in the bar but then later on when I tried to get in touch with her while she flaked now this may have happened for any number of reasons but again who really knows but the point is this is a very very common result of a purely cocky interaction like literally the second you leave they come out of state and boom zero interest in pursuing the person who they just fell in love with within five minutes of meeting okay so that's one example another example would be using super star sort of social circle game and group theory so you learn to become larger-than-life you learn to project mystery and intrigue so if you're doing this properly what you'll 10 have is you have people kind of flocking around you in the venue and basically everyone is wondering like who is this guy and as a result they'll become very very intrigued with you but very often you're going to get cases where when you try to get their number they'll do just very bizarre stuff like I remember way back in the day once my friend this very mysterious guy was running this type again and he met this woman he tries to get her number she declines and she starts crying like she's literally crying and she doesn't want him to leave she's like please you know don't leave please don't leave I'm so confused at what's happening here and then he takes off his top hat and puts it on her head and she starts saying like I filled the room spinning right so she's hovering around him she's giving all these indicators that she's interested in him like left and right and and she's literally so into him it's ridiculous however at the end of the night she won't let him get her number so these are anomalies of modeling a particular element of a successful style so a naturally cocky type guy would likely also have rapport building skills in and so forth so he wouldn't have this problem of instantaneous flake once they come out of state and in the second case if you had a genuine celebrity he might also have certain rapport building skills but the thing is when we emulate stuff like this we don't naturally include the rapport building and so as such what ends up happening is you lose the connection right so the answer you might ask what's the answer then it's to backtrack and actually build rapport with them once you successfully use these message methods to attract them okay so again the answer is to rewind and get a genuine connection with them once you've attracted them using your techniques so you get a genuine connection that you genuinely feel and then they'll want to see you again because you're friends unless of course we're talking about some kind of you know quote-unquote party girl who probably wouldn't date most guys anyway said she just wants casual encounters so in that case you know just provide what she wants if you're into that sort of thing and I know many of you probably are but otherwise if you don't do this you'll suffer from these like bizarre anomalies where they want to hook up with you but they give you weird resistance down the line so again this is a result of emulating parts but not all of a particular successful approach and this ties in with the old concept of the uncanny valley right the original concept of the uncanny valley suggests that humanoid objects which appear Olmo but not exactly like real human beings they elicit these sort of uncanny strangely familiar feelings of eeriness and revulsion and this is the result of conflicting perceptual cues so the negative effect associated with uncanny stimuli is produced by the activation of conflicting cognitive representations right so you get attention when someone perceives conflicting cues to I guess category membership such as when a humanoid figure moves like a robot or has other visibly robotic features and this conflict is experienced as a psychological discomfort that is eeriness right much like the discomfort that is experienced with cognitive dissidence now in pick up this feeling is triggered when you have a guy who's saying and doing the things that a cool guy who was attracted to her would say and do but it's not authentic right he's not congruent with it yet so like all those little sub communications simply aren't lining up so you want to watch for these sort of game anomalies when you're when you're going out now you know another big time anomaly that happens when it is when you're doing like pickup non-stop every day eventually you gain this sort of weird larger-than-life confidence and what happens is you go out so much you get this sort of unreal vibe and the problem with this is that you'll have difficulty establishing rapport when you're in this mode and you know the reason is because the girl you're talking you simply cannot connect with this sort of larger-than-life entity so the answer in this situation is to actually kind of get real and actually show some vulnerabilities I remember I was here in Miami several years ago on on the winter summit like I am now and I met a girl out at the club I think was like a Thursday night we were at the rec room and I hit it off with this girl was going very well we were kissing and you know making out etc etc and then at a certain point she kind of stops and she says you know what I bet you'd do this to everyone like you're just too smooth you do this to everyone right and now I could have been said something along the lines of oh no heavens no this this isn't me et cetera et cetera but instead I decided to kind of get real and what I said to her is like I go look like an ally to you this isn't my first rodeo I mean obviously if I'm able to go up and be Cara's attic in a social pressure situation like this you know you're right I probably am pretty good at doing this right but I'm gonna tell you the truth here I'm gonna level with you I'm I'm 40 years old and it's kind of been there done that I'm not just running around the cloud like some little puppy dog trying to talk to any girl that'll have me I only talk to girl to a girl if I like her I only talked to a girl if she makes my nostrils flare in a way she's like please stop doing that I'm a ha ha ha I thought yeah you know but but bear fact the matter is I chose you she's like oh like I like you girl and like and I and then and then we resumed and we ended up having a very pleasurable experience after that after the club ended so in that case you know I just kind of kept it real and showed those vulnerabilities but again this is only if you've been on some kind of like mega pickup marathon you're now so larger than life that you're suffering or I guess benefiting from the anomaly that you're this kind of superhuman which is of course the result of so much social interaction so much sex in general that you get this supernatural type of confidence and you projected just so much at any non celebrity type of person has again has difficulty connecting with you so this requires both self-reflection and an empathetic attunement to the people that you're interacting with and I really feel that these are two of the biggest things that whole guys back first is that an inability to put yourself on the cross so to speak and be real about where you're screwing up and then second this I guess kind of solipsistic view where you're really not paying attention to the people you're approaching is humans but it's some sort of means to an end so start to really consider these things and you're gonna see dramatic improvements in your ability to engage people with ease engage them with agility and that's when you start to have that ability to be comfortable in the pocket so to speak and be very very free and charismatic under those social pressure situations and this stuff of course has application far far far beyond dating as well right the power of charismatic communication is so far-reaching in fact that I decided to base my next project now it's still in the works but you can get on the list to be notified about all the new developments ESMA master e.com this has been Jeffy telling you to get out there and make the myths  [Music],lYaruROyY0Q
sir proverbial boy cheffy come at you today from Seattle Washington now last night we did an epic free tour in which a variety of topics were discussed first and foremost among them that you're gonna see in this video is the idea of understanding your value proposition when you're interacting with people and really coming at the interaction from a standpoint of marketing yourself as opposed to selling yourself and once you make this mental shift and kind of crack the code well you get any sort of congruence test where if shit tests are called you'll be able to cast these with flying colors [Music] calibrating but I think I'm interpreting a shit test as a no response and then I'm like oh better better back up okay so who's - who are some of the newer guys in here do you even understand what he what he's talking about there can you say can you say it without jargon just hyper paying attention to what you're doing and how that's affecting the girl so I noticed that when I'm trying to make sure that I'm not off-putting the girl sometimes she might be challenging my confidence and then I take that as I'm offending her and so I back off but then I never like crashed through that and I don't have success okay excellent so I was hanging out with my friend Derek the other day who's one of the other RC instructors and this guy's a very uncompromising individual all right when I say uncompromising he has a firm understanding of the value proposition for the girl if she were to hook up with him it's like she hooks up with me she's gonna get access to these experiences she's gonna get access to this certain worldview etc etc he understands that for her to hook up with him he believes it's a good idea now one thing that this guy said to me um years ago was the you want to think of marketing yourself and not selling so what is the distinction what is the difference between marketing and sales in a pickup context yeah yes yeah so positioning exactly so what he said was one is pulling them towards you through positioning and the other is going out of your way to attempt to convince so the idea is this what I used to go out in my early days of my career is you know a pickup guy I wanted to make every girl attractive that was my goal every girl should be attracted to me and I would go up and a lot of the routines that we used to use back in the day where I think geared towards making them appear as though they actually were attracted because there would be like bits or lines or witticisms maybe like ha ha ha ha ha and so you're pumping these emotions but it's sort of this like cheap high where they're like ha ha ha ha ha if you turn away from them for two seconds it just evaporates you know and you would be able to pull a girl back because you could keep her like you could keep it ha ha it's fun fun fun fun fun and then you'd be like let's go back false time constraint like you can't stay long it's right across the street oh it's just a little further and you would kind of finagle her back and then often you would face this like multiple hour  battle almost like diffusing a bomb you know you're like her The Hurt Locker or whatever and and it's just this whole wrenching scenario and so I did not like that I did not like getting these girls that did not think I was awesome so rather than trying to make 10 girls think I'm kind of cool and finagle them back my mentality now I want to find the one that thinks I am awesome I am absolutely awesome but the thing is you have to understand your value proposition is and I understand I'm for some not for others that was a big thing where I came to the realization that it's ok if some people don't like you now if everybody doesn't like you maybe there's a deeper issue going on there but you know some people don't like you that's fine because I understand my you know my humor tends to gravitate to little more towards the dark side I have very little tolerance for behavior I I consider idiotic etc etc but again no no harm no foul I just don't need to mess with you right and if you don't think I'm hilarious and the best thing ever that's fine too I can I can go talk to ten girls now granted I'm gonna rank choice those I'm gonna go into the environment find the ones that I'm most attracted to and rank them and then start working my way down right but if I if I have to talk to ten girls I can do that so that's what's what's gonna happen when you find that one girl there will be no finagling back to the place there will be no defusing of a bomb it will be an enthusiastic I guess synergy where she's like let's do this and it'll be awesome now along the way though people are going to test you now what are some of these tests that you're hearing that may not be a test  do you understand what that means though that that might not be a test it might be like you have failed please leave there's a distinction that I have a boyfriend now granted there are many many reasons why someone might say that I've had girls say that for no reason at all and they said then I found out they didn't and I was like why do you say they're like I don't know like this don't know I mean whatever or they actually do or they're like are you okay with that you're not gonna be calling me after are you I mean there's many many but but you have to discern when the I have a boyfriend or were lesbians which is the other very common I have a boyfriend style line is just like a please leave I'm trying to politely tell you to leave immediately because I'm repulsed by you or whatever whatever the case may be so what's okay look what is a what's a test that I get a lot what the fuck is wrong with you that's the test I hit that's actually a test I get quite a lot and I have a line that I have cultivated for this which is well I'm not entirely certain but if I had to hazard a guess I'd say it's most likely a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as upbringing anyway bla bla bla bla bla so the thing with with these tests is number one you have to arrive at a place where you no longer take it to heart write this opinion the opinion of this person who you likely did not even know existed two minutes ago has zero quantifiable effect on your day-to-day life like because this person said I have a belief and you're stupid like it it doesn't matter right so a lot of young girls like well it's disrespect it's affecting my ego it's like no but like you just get to a point where you just don't care anymore it's like no I don't get to a point where I just don't care anymore I arrived at a point where I came to the realization it didn't matter right what's the old saying when you're young you care what people think about you you're middle-aged you stop caring what people think about you and when you're an elder you realize nobody gave a fuck about you the entire time right that's why my grandpa is 98 years old he's pimping all over the town you know his wife died a couple years back got him rest in peace grandma but like now he's at Costco hey little girl how's the pizza I'm like grandpa grandpa he's in the nursing home he's like he's guys literally he's like the frat president of the fire of the Senior Center is Billy badass he's like taking shots with us at Christmas and stuff quit flying an airplane a couple years ago he's kind of my hero but um but anyway uh yeah he doesn't care at all he'll just talk to anyone you know he's like what like he can't even fathom that some like so if a girl often and she's like giving me grief I assume it's a joke because of course it has to be because no one could think that I'm not cool right now do I really believe that yes and no so when you're out you almost want to cultivate this sort of narcissistic persona right we all have different we all have different aspects to our personality we have a humble side we have a more narcissistic side we have an irreverent side we have a respectful side okay what is better for pickup respectful or irreverent what is better for pickup narcissism or humility generally yeah like I'm amazing I'm the shit like welcome it's Jeff Valentine you know it that's this what's up either you're into it or you're not are you in the warm end of the pool or are you not now she gives you grief you I guess the key you can't take it on board so you got to arrive at that point where you realize doesn't matter but then you also have look I remember the first time I ever like told the guy who came into my set and back in the day we had all these like I don't we don't do this really anymore and now most the time I'll just ignore them and like plow over so the girl I get the girl's attention just keep the girl's attention away from him but we used to do these little gambits and stuff and I said to this guy it's like cool shirt man I had one just like that in high school I bet you get all the girls with that but but that shirt gets you laid all the time doesn't it and he's like like it kind of this guy was like cool - I kind of affect him the girls like haha get simulaid like it worked but then I was like when I said it I was like is this guy gonna attack me and I was like I was saying there's one things like fill the feeder like creeping up my head my BAE like my artery like oh ho and then he's like just kind of tooled so the next time I like engaged in a confrontation like that I wasn't as afraid anymore so it's the same thing like these girls you know I've heard it all man I've been I've been out for 16 years I've literally heard every single thing that they could conceivably say to me right like every conceivable thing right like remember one time I was out and uh I hope I get I'm remembering this correctly some girl said I know you you're that crazy van guy so she's at you saying you're that you're the van pickup artist I was like hey that's dr. van pickup artists to you I didn't spend all those years in medical school to not be address with the proper honorific and she was like oh ha ha ha and then it just went on from there I was like wow ok because I just like who who would say that doctor like he just sprang into my mind because I wasn't like scrambling to think of something I just said the first thing that came to mind because I was on stifle money and take it to heart another time I had a girl ask me she's talking to the suit and the suit was being very nice and respectful but I was kind of like yeah damn girl look at this shit etc etc she's like I like you you're a nice guy your friend like wants me this guy's an asshole I don't like this guy I'm like what I'm like whatever it's like what's wrong with you well I'm not entirely certain but rubber Tubber daddy right my gosh like know what it's like this guy's gay it's like you're gay I can tell look at you you're gay and I and I look her up and down I'm like I am now  after observing this mr. Botha sartorial debacle and she's she's like no she's like nope nope you like it up the ass you like it up yes I'm like a that doesn't make me gay okay it's experimentation so again and then from there psych hahaha very funny so the ability to roll the a lot of these tests you got understand they're not gonna be testing and understand this they're not gonna test some like they're gonna test my grandpa who was 98 because he's like clearly not any sort of like sexual prospect to them like they're like oh just a sweet old man number one roll with it agree and amplify another thing that often say like damn you guys are like the mean cool kids used to make fun of me in high school I'm just gonna go home and cry listen to Lionel Richie while looking at a candle I'm putting cigarettes out of my dick like I do every night my entire dick and balls it's one cigarette burn looks like Freddy Krueger's dick you ever seen Freddy Krueger Nightmare on Elm Street you know Nightmare on Elm Street that was actually my favorite horror villain Freddy Krueger was my favorite because if you think about it like all of the other classic horror villains like Michael Myers Jason they just kind of like wordlessly chase you and say nothing but like Freddy had like quips he's like hey bitch time to die like he would you know he'd have like little puns and make dad jokes and shit yeah so I always like no no literally just Trent so I transitioned off of it into that right so that's the thing you can't just like hear the test have it land say your little quip and then hope it worked it's like no you're in control of the conversation you're not even allowing that stuff oxygen you're not even giving it air to breathe things that do not help you you don't even hear maybe you hear but you don't take it on board or something serious so number one either a green amplify brush it off make some self-deprecating comment whatever but then change the subject and keep talking I think the ability to have that million-dollar mouthpiece to be unstyled to flow to come up with humor on the fly that is what game that's a big part of what game is now I had a friend of mine he said game is two things number one everybody's bored when you go out everyone's bored so give them something different to talk about that's number one and the number two make it easy for her to go home with you and not feel guilty about it so give him something to talk about is what the ability to go up add energy to the interaction add fun they don't really even care about the content what are they care about the feeling what is the emotional feeling that I get by speaking to this person is it something that I want to have more of or is it something where he is needing it to work and there's some sort of defensive element that will result in a bad outcome for him is he essentially out asking me to buoy his emotional state up like I'm just here to have fun I don't want to deal with this no thank you and they will leave whereas even if like this guy yeah maybe he's saying things are a little outrageous but it's fun he's having fun with it he doesn't really seem to care if I'm even here or not you know so marketing so I would say this like sales versus marketing what do you need to sell like a product it needs to be sold it's like Doritos like here's the new dough Rito with the Cool Ranch Mountain Dew zest or whatever they've got the snap and the critter they something like oh I want to get the Dorito versus an iPhone there's gonna be like the new ones out if you want it and was like yeah they're like waiting in line right so if you you have to be the iPhone in this situation don't be a Dorito ya know but we'll get sued don't be corn chips don't be generic corn chips  be a fruit named telephone company computing company so helmed by a visionary who died by eating fruit to cure his cancer being yourself and allowing the chips to fall where they may now this is weird because isn't that like the men's health wisdom just be yourself well the thing is you're being yourself not this stifled version of yourself so you're allowing yourself to be expressive you're finding the people who you have chemistry with and ironically or I guess paradoxically the less you care about needing it to work the more people you'll seem to have chemistry with because they're not feeling this again defensive needy vibe neediness is perhaps the most unattractive characteristic of all if you're in the headspace like I hope I don't like I'm going to approach this woman on a need to hook the set I need it to open if it does not open if she is not into me I am diminished the little ego is threatened it is I am somehow affected negatively in a tangible way right so you've really got to click into a headspace where you know that look on a given night at the beginning of the night I mean I may not be in that like fully open headspace why inertia it's like it's there's there's an inertia to action there's an inertia to inaction it's also a homeostasis if I'd been like talking logically or just sitting around by myself all day and now I go out to the club and it's time to transform into like fun outgoing individual it might be kind of a jarring it's a change it's a state change so a lot of times we just have a resistant to state change so for me personally I've been doing this for so long I'll usually talk to one or two people I'll be like oh yeah right I'm hilarious what was I thinking okay hello there and like you know continue on with the night but I'm just going to be like a lot of things I'll state other ones you might not like you might think it's revolting or in poor taste but it's like sorry so you've really got to arrive at that point where you're no longer putting that on there persona you have to understand again the value proposition you're bringing to the girl like I understand very well the value proposition for the girls just putting your persona out though often isn't enough you have to know the mechanics of game I have to know where am I in the interaction what's the next step what should I be doing I'm not aimlessly just like here's my fun personality I hope we have sex it's like no here's my fun personality you're enjoying being around this because you like the emotional vibe that's being put out which means you want to be around it more and then I know how to move us through the steps in a way that's not weird or pushy and makes it very easy for it to go and deals with the logistical offices  [Music],lcn3i71XX1A
you're the master of your thought the molder of your character and the maker and shaper of your conditioned environment and destiny this is a quote from the seminal self-help classic as a man thinketh by James Allen James Allen was actually born in 1864 in Leicester England and I'm here in London today so I thought that I talked a little bit about this again classic self-help book now James only had a bit of a rough upbringing his father was actually murdered when he was 15 years old and he had to start going to work and eventually he ended up becoming a professional writer and when he was 38 in 1902 he wrote the classic as a man thinketh and it truly is one of the classic self-help books because it explores the basic idea of all self-actualization which is that through conscious effort you can actually control both your inner thoughts and character as well as your external circumstances and again this is like the central tenet of all cellphone now most people assume that we actually have free will we're not robots and therefore we have control over our thoughts most people also believe that since thoughts aren't actually tangible they don't necessarily have any real power in the real world therefore you can actually think one way and act and behave a different way however the central premise of James Allen's book is that your unconscious mind is actually extremely powerful and in fact this manifests every single time that you're faced with a question of willpower right we say why can't I do this whether that's like fitness whether that's dealing with your finances whether that's approaching women you want to you know step to the girl and be smooth you want to improve your diet you want to save money etc etc but you just can't seem to do it you might even know intellectually exactly what to do but you just can't seem to make it all come together so James Allen he actually realized that your will can be thwarted by thoughts to the contrary by contrary thoughts so he therefore arrived at his now very famous conclusion which is of course what we don't attract what we want we attract what we our success only happens when you actually embody it in other words you don't get success you become success so if you think about what you want you think about positive thoughts towards your goals etc you do that consciously that's what you're going to attract if you're continually ruminating and thinking about negative stuff well then you're going to see that manifest more and more and more in your actual day to day life now Allan discusses in his book also at length the idea that a calmness of mind is actually the best path to success so when you see people who are always calm relaxed purposeful it might seem like this is just how these people are but in reality it's almost always a result of conscious effort at self control so in other words these people who are actually aware of how their mind works and able to control it are the ones that get success and this is of course why the practice of meditation is stressed so frequently not only throughout the self-help Canon but also in RSD right and it's having that ability to return to Center and move on after a negative scenario so these times these people they seem to kind of effortlessly attract good things because they're not getting tossed around by the vicissitudes of the environment right in other words success avoids unstable people and as somebody who can relate to what James Allen went through you know as a child with the death of his father and all that I had a pretty rough childhood myself there's that other famous quote from as a man thinketh which really resonated with me which is circumstances do not make a person they reveal him and on one hand it's kind of easy to take a look at this and say that it's insensitive to people who have been victimized or who are like born into poverty or who had bad things happen to them that were you know outside of their control might seem like you know them it's their fault circumstances don't make Mandy reveal him but you know as they say the Lord works in mysterious ways and I am far from a religious person but you know it is true that in every circumstance there is an opportunity for growth so if you're continually thinking about how you know you're a victim you've been wronged you've been victimized bad has happened to you well it's unlikely that you're actually going to take steps to improve that situation so yes bad things can't happen to good people but by being defensive about it and continue to being angry about and harboring it as part of your identity you're going to actually ingrain those circumstances into your being and your identity more and more and more and thereby you're going to you're going to attract that kind of stuff in your life even more so what this is ultimately saying is that on the one hand you have no one to blame but yourself for your problems but on the other hand it means that the possibilities are limitless so there's been Jeff you are st and saint cheers to limitless possibilities and I'll see you next time on rst nation,lg7vGQ285bg
"- Hi-diddly-ho neighbourinos, Jeffy here coming to you from Denver. Bringing you some more wisdom from my many, many years in the bizarre world of professional pickup instruction, dating, coaching whatever you wanna call it. Anyway, today I wanna talk to you about your general outlook and how this affects your ability to learn and be successful at the game. (upbeat techno music) Before I dive in I wanna take a little moment to remind you to like and subscribe, so boom, hit them buttons below and having done that, we're off to the proverbial races, okay. So, to start off I think that one of the most underrated aspects of the games that's talked about is positivity, okay it sounds kinda happy, touchy-feely but it's true, and I'd say that this is definitely up there among the top aspects of a guy's personality that make for a good pickup artist. Along with other things such as confidence, humor, et cetera, but positivity is definitely up in that top tier. So, when I meet up with guys who are learning this stuff, which does have so many awesome things about it, if you think about it. Pickup, you know it's one of my favorite hobbies. But sometimes I meet guys and they're very very negative about it, they have a lot of negativity surrounding it. The first thought that goes through my mind is actually how ironic this is that a guy whose trying to improve with women is going about it by being a negative butt-hurt whiner, right? So if you think about it the two don't actually mix. Because, if you harbor resentments, you have these negative opinions about women, negative opinions about social interaction in general, well, do you think that this could hold back your results with women? Well the answer is a resounding yes. Now why do you think that is? Well it's pretty simple, because if in your subconscious mind whenever you're out there interacting with someone, whether it's a hot girl or anyone for that matter. Your brain is saying to yourself, I'm a bitter little loser who spends his time ruminating about how unfair life is and furthermore I think that women are shit. If that's what's going through your head then that's inevitably going to present itself in your outward communications as well. Regardless of whether or not you're consciously aware of that. You know that confidence is a major part of this game right, and positivity is in many ways a foundation of your confidence. So to put it a different way, if you think badly of people, if you think badly of the world in general, in many ways that is a reflection of what you think about yourself. And this is kind of an odd statement on the surface and this is a statement that frankly I wouldn't have believed back in the day when I was starting out. But there is solid, scientific research backing this up, and if you're not familiar with this kind of research I would say find it, study it, live it, learn it. 'Cause all this stuff goes very, very, very deep okay? Everything from your mind acknowledging a certain standard of what you'll devote your time to, right? And how much you value your time is a huge indicator of how much you value yourself as a person, to what kind of energy you're putting out there into the world to kinda put it nebulous. Get a little nebulous about it, get a little esoteric, a little abstract. You know one of the big buzz words in RSD aside from chode, and maybe low vibrational energy, another big buzz word that we use a lot is that concept of a value taker. So what's a value taker? Well a value taker is a guy who doesn't have enough of his own things going on in his life, so his interactions with other people largely consist of leaning on them emotionally in one way or another. Like asking them to buoy up their emotional state. Right, so this is the guy who approaches women at the club through that lens of he's trying to weasel his way into their party. Like, excuse me ladies can I join the fun? As opposed to the guy whose already enjoying his night, and then he's adding that energy to theirs. In other words, he basically sees women having a good time and he goes up there, again trying to like, excuse me ladies will you please buoy up my emotional state for the night? And they're just like no, right? He's not adding energy he's leeching it off of them and he's essentially asking them to expend their energy to help him have a better time in the night right? So look, ask yourself this. When you look someone in the eye, can you be totally at ease holding eye contact with them? Because you know internally you're a solid guy, you know that everyone you interact with has a generally good experience with you. If that's not the case, then that's probably something you should work on right? Take on the old self-help positivity challenge that I undertook, many years ago and what it is, is you try to go 10 days where you think only positive thoughts by focusing only on the good sides of people. Only on the good sides of the world. Even if like petty little things happen, you gotta cut yourself off, or you have to start over again. So you make a commitment that you're only going to offer value and you're not gonna involve yourself in anything that is not constructive. So, a lot of guys have problems with this. 'Cause they see themselves as Batman right? Leave the putting people in check to the people who have nothing better to do. Right as a tribal leader, so to speak, you're too busy to do that shit, you know that other people will most likely take care of it and if they don't Karma will. Right, which I think Karma's just basically physics. Anyway, try this out and if you can get through it, you'll notice it's doing some pretty interesting things for your self esteem, so just for one example. Like, I live in a pretty big house and I rent rooms out in it, right? So the vast majority of people are cool in their dealings with me business wise, but on occasion someone will screw me over, so, say for example they'll abruptly move out and leave me like zero time to find a replacement. Or they'll kinda like move out and screw me on bills, et cetera, now when this happens. In the past I've often entertained thoughts about like nickel and diming them on their deposit, putting in little charges or making it just equally inconvenient for them just to be kind of a dick. Like, they were a dick to me, I'm gonna be a dick back. But you know what, then I'm just like, I'm not that fucking guy. It's not a good use of my time and it's not a good place for my mental energy to be. As satisfying as that might be in the short term to give them a little malicious compliance as they say on Reddit, ultimately I just think that the price that I pay in terms of my self image, isn't worth it, I like to think of myself as a guy who deals fairly with people and is ultimately a pretty decent person alright? So maybe you are a person who has some negative tendencies but you're still getting laid so you're like, what's the fucking point? Well I'd say try it anyway man! 'Cause you can always improve your results, and by the way if you are one of those people whose response to this is on the opposite end of the spectrum, you're like yeah fuck those negative guys! Well then you're also kinda missing the point, okay. 'Cause negative people, they are people too, they're just positivity challenged, right? So there are probably good things about them, and, not even probably, there are good things about them. They're just kinda deeper beneath the surface. Now I personally, I have no beef with anybody man. I've let go tons of nonsense that people have thrown at me over the years. Now of course I'll likely never hang out with these people in real life, I wouldn't like, go fishing with them. Because we don't vibe well off of each other, but you know I honestly do wish them the best. Like, hopefully things will work out awesome for 'em. 'Cause my view is this, it's pretty simple. The world is overall a pretty awesome place, okay overall girls are fun, social interaction is fun, so be happy about it. So that's it, I mean, this is something that I've talked about before in these videos and I'll most likely talk about it again. You know when I'm up there giving my talks, I'm lecturing, my demeanor, like if you come to a free tour often times I'll be answering questions. My demeanor is kinda brusque, I'm kinda a little tough-lovey right, partially because I'm trying to deliver a lot of information in a short period of time. But if you notice my infields when I'm out there interacting with women say in a pickup context and it's not about information, but about emotion. Then I tap into what I call the happy eyes state okay? Basically, my eyes go bright and I'm just there to convey a vibe that draws here in, that compels her to want to spend more time with me. I have like an enthusiasm about being there okay? And this is a big part of what's known as charisma. Right that nebulous quality known as charisma, and perhaps not coincidentally, it is gonna be the topic of my next big project which is a broad spectrum training program designed to develop this magnetic quality that I'm tentatively calling Charisma Mastery. And this is gonna be my next big legacy piece, so to speak. So I'm being very very meticulous and thorough about the curriculum, and what does that mean in practical terms? It means it's still kinda a ways off. But if you wanna get on the early VIP list to be notified when it's coming out, go to CharismaMastery.com and you can sign up for that VIP to keep in the loop right now. Anyway this has been ya boy from Denver, Mile High City where everyone's high all the time and I'll see you next time.! Okay so let's do a quickie little breakdown of what happened there. And now it's time to dance! I would go so far as to say, that guys who cannot hook the stat, stat, stat, stat! 80% of the time, this is the problem. (excited yelling) (hype music) Hey! Hey, freeze motherfucker! Ey, good evening. (upbeat techno music) He doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him, so why the fuck, why the fuck should she? (upbeat techno music) - This is the roof of the mouth right here. Aah ahh! - Aah ahh! - Ahh Oh, oo. - Ahh oh. Right? - Yes. (upbeat techno music) - Smelling something nice, touching shoulders. - Ahh ahh - That's the touchdown right there. Not just being loud but being clear so that, 'cause sometimes people will say what, what, what? They heard you, they heard the noise. (upbeat techno music) - Good evening, you appear to be a very classy lady, I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps with cheese? - And when you say one, two, three. - One, two, three. - Your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding. (upbeat techno music) That just looks so uncomfortable, you look so uncomfortable. - Yeah I do! (upbeat techno music) - Go head. - Saa! - That was nice. - Just clenching it here in order to push. - Yes and that's what we don't want. - Okay that's what we don't want. - We don't want that, now here we have a giant model of the larynx, this is laryngitis. - Oh wow. - You can see that they're swollen. - This is probably what my boss's cords look like. - I learned to be out of the matrix and be positive. What the fuck are you fucking talking about. (upbeat techno music) - Oh, I'm like literally cringing. - [Man] She said it, she was like my voice tone was like average or above average, yours is like amazing. (upbeat techno music) - Ah ha don't do this! Don't do that, sit down, shut up, bla bla bla. The other, but you're dumb, you're dumb! You're dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb! You're dumb! Your clothes are stupid. (upbeat techno music) Again, we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional attunement when we're telling stories. Do you want to be more excited he he haha or do you need to be more like calm and collected? And that'll change often dynamically during the interaction itself. (upbeat techno music) It's very imperative and not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice. You're gonna be able to go out and project. - Take your finger like this, and push it, push it and then-- - Whoa! (all three laughing) - Isn't that weird? It's the weirdest thing, when I saw this, I was like what the heck is going on? - I believe, and I truly believe this, it's only a matter of time until they like me. I'm her roommate now. You're evicted. I'd love to introduce you to my family. (upbeat techno music) - Gave me a huge awareness of my voice how to speak to people. - He teaches you how to do it, the technicalities behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling and humor. - Put on the, at first you know a little Vaudeville like hello my darling, hello my baby! You know am I right, some little act and that's obviously quite draining. - Why I ever got interested in the whole game concept as like a wacky chick is just I wanna know how the fuck to project myself. Jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve for so, so, so long.

yo yo yo what up it's me your boy and I'm here today to talk to you about a magical creature a magical lower hominid that performs a magical dance and I'm of course referring to the mythical dancing monkey aka the entertainer guy now what's this all about well when you're out meeting people there's often a fine line between actually enjoying yourself and having fun and actually behaving in a way that's trying to impress others that actually ends up being kind of off-putting so where is that line where is that sort of gray area when does it having fun cross over into entertainer man dancing monkey syndrome land let's explore okay so here we are back in my lovely home where all of the magic happens so to speak creepy but anyway the topic of today's video this so-called dancing monkey syndrome or entertainer guy syndrome that seems to have flicked so many guys who were learning game it actually came up from an email that I got from a former clients of former boot camp student and I have really do have an open-door policy when it comes to alumni in the sense that not a real open-door policy where you can enter my home at any time you wish but a virtual open-door policy where you can feel free to shoot me questions because you're bound to have questions after a program they might be abstract questions about how you're feeling personally as you learn this stuff integrated into your life or they could be very specific questions about here's a specific situation I'm not sure how I should respond to this etc etc so your success is my success as corny as that sounds and I really want people to be able to get on the meme tree so to speak and take this information and go out and use it to enrich their own lives and bring joy to other people's lives as well so it's very very important to me so I'm always very good about responding to alumni emails I have respond to random emails from random viewers and subscribers like yourself if you're not a subscriber actually take a moment subscribe to this channel now like this video etc etc so you can get the real talk brought to you every week but anyway so this was an email that I got from and by the way if you are interested in sending me your own questions you can shoot those over to Jeff at real social dynamics calm and there's a pretty good chance if it's a good question it'll end up being answered on this channel so anyway like I said this was an email from a former client and let me just read it out to you um dear Jeff this is something that I've noticed in my game recently I've been consciously thrashing out my value system and becoming clearer and clearer about what I want in life I've been working on cutting out any reaction seeking or button-pushing stuff which is harder than I thought it would be but it's rewarding I've been going out and focusing only on having fun and taking consistent action I've been trying to be indifferent and doing the least amount possible to get to the next stage also not giving away my power I'm realizing more and more that I am high value at my core all good right well it seems I'm becoming pretty much unimpressed with most people I meet and more and more critical of their behaviors most of them in fact 99% I've met recently FM being honest just fall short in a lot of areas hotness isn't enough I'm rejecting more people based on unacceptable behavior a good thing but still there's this gap emerging between I what I feel like inside high core value and my infield results I'm closing less and just getting generally less far in the interactions I have far less motivation to pass tests to keep the vibe positive to push through resistance or sometimes even to open why should I I'm money they should be opening me now at this point if you're watching this you might be especially if you're an intermediate type guy you might be thinking yourself I've been struggling with this exact same thing myself and it's very very very common it's something that I personally encountered as well and that's why I chose to answer this but but again that we're not let me just finish it out here suddenly my game was probably tightest about two months ago when I was probably more dancing monkey syndrome than I'd like to admit but I was enjoying it nevertheless and I was actually getting pretty good results I know that in my heart I know in my heart that being unreactive and sure to myself is really the right path for me right now though it seems to be bringing out aspects of myself aren't compatible with meeting people and aren't compatible with generating a good vibe anyway it's just something I'm noticing creeping into my game not a huge deal but I'd like to catch it while it's still small and I could six months down the line and find out that I'm one of those angry bitter dudes who thinks he's the best but can't even open Wow so that that's a lot to unpack there but I think we all know one of those guys who thinks he's the best but can't even open oftentimes it's a civilian friend but it's even more disheartening when it becomes a guy who knows the game because he really should know better so to the writer of this email I want to address you right now I think well you might be experiencing here is like I said a very core dilemma that I've seen from all the inner game type guys in the community back in the day before we switch over to natural game and then the guys had routines and then they became natural game guys basically what I saw back then is a guy where they would start off by being a dancing monkey so to speak for a long time you know routines and stuff like that and then at some point they'd finally snap and they'd just be like screw this I'm not running around like this clown anymore in the club I you know I know what I want I'm not gonna be doing that stuff anymore and at this point most often what would happen is the results would go way way down and I think that one of the reasons for this is that they simply didn't want to put themselves out there anymore right they decided to shut off that part of themselves and this is also really bad because you'd see a lot of gurus so-called gurus stop getting results for this exact same reason and then they didn't have becoming really bitter at the whole community and just dropping out of it I mean I've been doing this for 15 years so I've seen it all but personally I remember when I started getting into that whole you know unreactive standards mindset there was an incident where I was actually out at the club with a buddy of mine who was one of the most dancing monkey guys who can imagine actually right super cool guy very smart guy but dancing monkey nonetheless and this night guess-who left with someone while I was derping around trying to look cool and active the dancing monkey I so when this happened this actually kind of blew my mind at the time because the things that he was doing were totally against the direction that I've been going in right and at this point I realized I guess the the next sort of principle about this whole thing which is this put your personality fully out there right put your personality on the chopping block so to speak so my entertainer guy friend what I realized is he wasn't really being reactive he was just doing whatever he wanted to do and was just sort of putting himself out there and and ultimately of amusing himself so he wasn't like a lot of these you know so-called game guys who Pumped various lines pump various bits or routines they know they dropped the line and then they'd wait there on pause for their reaction right like did you like it like crossing their fingers that the person's going to respond favorably so so he was just simply hammering them with his nonsense really not carrying one way or another simply why because he liked it and he thought it was funny and so that was a huge realization on me and the realization that I got from this was that there's no problem with being a dancing monkey as long as it's coming from the right place so think of it like this having fun even if it's being kind of clownish is good trying to get their reaction is bad so be your own dancing monkey in other words and really this just kind of comes down to the whole principle of whatever you feel they feel like the number one rule the game whatever you feel they're gonna feel so if you're in state it works now most guys who you see out who are game guys who are kind of dancing monkey ish those guys are reactive and that's why we say that we say don't act like that don't be the dancing monkey because we tend to associate it with being one of those guys who's reactive like do you like it do you like it but the thing is if you're not reactive then you're now reactive right plain and simple it doesn't matter how you act the subtle things in your eyes your voice the sub communications are gonna come through that you're actually unreactive right the self is always shining through and beyond that remember neediness is perhaps the most unattractive characteristic of all so with my outgoing buddy when he's out there he's just entertaining himself but at the same time he knows the flip side of the coin where he also knows how to move things along smoothly how to move the in Iraq to the next level to that romantic level so even if some of the things he does technically are a little bit sloppy this guy is gonna get great results almost every night he goes out why because he's got that clean self-contained fun energy and furthermore he's very very present with the girl right he's not up in his head thinking about what to say or do next to entertain them so I'd even go so far to say you want to be so self contained that if they were to like leave you would barely even notice and this is something that we've referred to in the past as the so-called hot guy blase this sort of studied nonchalance this attitude where you're not crowding them like hey come on do you like it you like it you're simply kind of putting yourself in that middle space putting yourself out there but then giving them room to sort of meet you in the middle space right giving them that room to meet you in the middle and that of course brings us to the next issue which is becoming naturally screening now even if you think this is something that's holding you back right now I think that this naturally screening mindset that the set that mindset that you developed eventually is gonna help you big time and the reason for that is you know if you think about what's the point of having standards and being naturally screening is that even if you're super being super nice to the person like you know you're making out with them that'd be that'd be pretty nice right even if you're doing that there's just this vibe about you that just doesn't quite give them all the validation right and this is so important especially if you're going for that so-called elite caliber because with them it's like even the slightest validation you give them it's like poof off to the next now when we bring this up the argument that some guys would give here is like well if she's like that and why would you even water but honestly between you and me I think that's pure sour grapes talking I mean come on like they barely know you the nightclub is a place they go for stimulation like to dance whatever etc etc not necessarily some place they're going to like meet their future spouse right but you know overall I think that being naturally screening it's like you're sort of this kind of father figure or like like a shepherd or something as opposed to this dude who has like contempt and dissatisfaction towards the people he's forced to interact with so it's like it's like you're just this kind of fun cool dude who's nice to them but at the same time you're completely on a reactive to their frame right so anyway I think that this point here that that this guy brings up it's very very important because the idea of being unreactive the idea of having standards well it's one of those things that can wind up the way that so much of game can end up being which is misunderstood and you know just frankly misapplied so with these videos I really want to try to hash out all the specifics of it and that's why I do these videos furthermore in this email the guy mentioned that he had been doing this for two months right he'd been doing the standards thing for two months straight so why not at this point go back to dancing monkey or whatever right ultimately it's just an expression of a side of your personality if that's what you're putting out there then it's gonna tend to work for you and one of the reasons that I got to the level where I'm at is because I in the past when I was coming up I always did a lot of similar exercises right just go out and like focus on one specific thing for like a two-month period of time and then I'd scrap it and just like reintegrate it in my overall game and you know there's something that I always tell my clients at the end of bootcamp I'll tell them look I'm gonna send you final notes and they're gonna be quite extensive they might be ten pages of these notes and when you get it this is gonna be your template of stuff to work on as you go out after the program and it might be a bit overwhelming to look at all this information right but how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time there's a lot of parallel focuses in this stuff and you have to also understand that you're not going to be able to learn it all at once and then furthermore when you're focusing on one area you might have to go a step back to make that two steps forward jump right in for an example like say you're going out and you're focusing just on you know again having standards or you're focusing just on dealing with the peer group or physicality or whatever the case may be and you're trying all this new stuff out and you're not congruent with it yet so you know the set tanks or whatever and then you're like damn it if only I had just behaved like I normally did I would have actually had a better chance of getting success but the thing is once you actually learn it you actually internalize it then you reintegrate it back in your overall game and then it comes back like a tsunami right so again thanks for sending me these questions by the way feel free to shoot me your questions at Jeff and real social dynamics dot-com and you might see them answered on this very channel so anyway there's been your boy Jeffy your extensible boy telling you to get out there and make the mix [Music],nY4EB01ldOE
"[Music] patient appreciation good afternoon world this is Jeffy coming at you today from Walcott Iowa at the world's largest truck stop taking a little cross-country Drive from New York back to San Francisco I've decided to stop off here and it's quite exciting it's basically like a big mall with a lot of tchotchkes and I just tried my first ever Taco Bell Doritos taco loco supreme and the verdict was pretty good but overall it's basically like immediate gastrointestinal jihad like like immediate to gastrointestinal she odd so if you're thinking about trying it might a go for it but make sure that you have some sort of restroom nearby and it'd probably be it probably tastes a lot better if if you're drunk if you're really really drunk having said all that we crack into the topic of today's little video blog here and that's going to be you know it's a question I get a lot from time to time a lot from time zones question I get a lot from people who live in kind of a more rural area who don't live not even a rural area necessarily but who don't live in like a you know a big-ass city where they can go out and then they can actually you know go to a place where there's tons of girls you know they end up the the common complaints I hear as well you know it's a small town I see the same people out you know I've been going up for a couple months and I continue to see the same people out it's very cliquey I'm getting a weird reputation etc etc so you know you're dealing with this kind of this kind of situation obviously it you know the conventional wisdom is to just like brush it off and be like we'll never mind them fuck your reputation you know who don't care what other people think etc etc etc of course look you know there's there's Theory then there's reality so I'm quite aware that these that these realities exist so you know because I frequently will get students from in of had students in the past who live in rural areas but you know or even a less populated urban area who encountered these issues so my advice to them and it continues to be the same advice and you may not like it my advice is going to be fucking fucking move right that's it like bottom line that's that's going to be the optimal solution to that is just move you know get the hell out of the of the rural area and more populated area where you can slam up sets night after night after night and still not see anyone you know now of course  that in and of itself is not going to necessarily be the end-all be-all solution I mean I live in San Francisco which you know what's the population last check was something like 800,000 people you know that's a it's a shit ton of folks packed into a little 7 by 7 mile area so over 10 years have I got like some reputation fuck yeah I've got some kind of reputation in fact often times if all like bang some I'll hook up with some girl and it should be like you know add me on Facebook well that's a good topic in and of itself so but sometimes I will add them on Facebook and then I'll like be like okay let's look her up Wendy Jenkinson you know Wendy van der Sloot snoot salute let's go a salute Wendy van der slut so a looker up and boom if there's like you have five mutual friends and I'm like Oh had sex with her had sex with her at sex and fare like literally I've had this this kind of thing happened so you know it is a fishbowl a bit so it's kind of interesting too because you know we say reputation isn't necessarily a bad thing there's no such thing as bad press right  no such thing as bad press right I mean and oftentimes like in public to be like oh this guy he's he's a disgusting reprobate and a degenerate and this guy off kissed his cheesy tactics this man is a blight on society it sent her in cetera right but then in like if I meet up with them one on one they'll be like hmm I wonder what the allure is I want to see for myself it wouldn't work on me and then you know of course some was a dozen but sometimes it does so so there's that anyway um now back to the original point I mean moving like what I said people to move it's like they don't want to root you know uproot their entire lives hack everything they own in some truck and like I mean it's a huge pain in the ass you know especially when you consider inertia and the cost of moving and the cost of living in a bigger city and stuff like that can be quite intimidating but for the students that I've had in the past who I advise do that who actually went ahead and did it Wow you know some of the best some of the literally some of the biggest success stories I know take for example Saad who was a instructor with RSD for a while he you know he was an Indian kid growing up in I believe Louisiana and he's like you know when you go out in Louisiana you're talking if you're talking to some girl there's about and you're like a brown kid talking to some girl in like rural like Shreveport or something you know he talked to a girl and and there's five guys who all of a sudden want to talk to you you know so I told him but you know you got to get the fuck out of there and so he dropped out of school he moved to New York City on a whim basically with almost no money as packing no plan and you know within a year so he became probably the one of the best guys a day game I know and it became an rst instructor um another guy who goes by the name of danger he was on the show I believe he's on the forms a showcase uh hi uh he was he was a 23 year old kid took program came to me he was currently living or at the time rather he was living in palm Palm Springs in California and you know working as a golf caddie and he's like you know there's not much opportunity for nightlife there you know it's kind of older etc etc I'm like yo look at the other boot camp like look you want the ultimate advice you don't know what I really think you should do I think you should do this number one move the hell out of there move to Las Vegas get a job somehow promoting or in the nightclub industry and go out every single night for a year and you will never have to think about this ever again it will be handled so anyway you know it's like the goodbyes on bootcamp he went off and a couple months later I get a you know an email from he's like I did it I actually moved and I'm in Vegas now and flash-forward to about a year later world summit you know rst world summit in Las Vegas rolls around and I see him out there and oh hey what's up man how you been it's like I'm killing it out here it's amazing you know I can't believe I didn't didn't do this earlier I'm like wow well what's her success look like and it this is crazy because before he had taken the bootcamp in his 23 hit slept with five girls like a year since 3 and he pulls out his camera he's like here's one here's one it's a stripper hottie turbo model I'm like holy shit the student has become the master right and I love that I create a couple monsters every year who end up action end up like kind of surpassing so it was cool to see that the long story short he you know he stepped long story short he stepped up and made the change had it ended up having incredible success so you know maybe it's not in your circumstance stack you know it's not within your realm of possibilities to do it right now but it's if you're in that situation where you know you're in a more rural area you can't go up and just bang the guns continually and not render the same people or you have these concerns about reputation and stuff definitely something to consider and it really is at the end of the day I think the only real solution if you want to get good because you know you want to get good you got to put in your 10,000 hours as they say so having said that I'm going to go in and maybe get some tchotchkes maybe a belt buckle with like a naked girl on it or something that says America and I'll see you next time Cheers confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion and creation  [Music]",oGxYYSA4loM
hey hey this is Jeffy here and today I want to talk to you about my experiences with so-called low level fame and what that's actually taught me about social interaction in general and how you can actually use these lessons to improve your success out there in the big wide world of I've actually been traveling around the world doing live events with RSD since 2002 and what I'm talking about here is boots on the ground live speaking events where I'm talking to a few hundred people every single week and it wasn't long after that that I started getting recognized out at the clubs and then in 2010 I actually started up my youtube channel and since then I've grown my subscriber list to a moderate but a significant number which by the way reminds me to remind you to take a moment right now to like and subscribe to my channel I'm putting out new content every Tuesday so smash these buttons yo alright but yeah as somebody who isn't necessarily famous but who does get recognized out on the street and in the club a lot the first thing that I can say to you is that it is so so easy to accidentally come off as a major dickhead to fans when in reality your only intention is to actually be a nice guy and I can't tell you how many times I might have been packing up my gear after a video shoot or after a free tour and had guys come up to me and just want to talk to me maybe congratulate me on the speech thanking me for coming out and being so caught up in what I'm doing I might just blow them off by just you know giving a monotone oh thanks thanks for coming or something like that or say for example I'm breezing through the airport trying to make a tight connection four hours sleep from boot camp and some guy comes up to me wants to say hey thank you for what you do and I'm just like oh hey and just kind of again blow right past him but in all reality I actually really really appreciate what these guys are trying to do you so much in fact and it's not until afterwards I realize how I might have come off as rude so that's not how I actually want to present myself that's not how I want to interact with you guys at all and another thing which is kind of interesting to think about is the more you have the more random people might try talking you like you know say you're like a real famous person like an actor or something like that and it just must be overwhelming because not only are you constantly being battered on all sides it might be by people who are nothing like you and whose interests are just so so different and almost alien to you that it's basically impossible to relate to them so with Fame you can realize it's kind of funny you can realize your audience can be very very very different from you in terms of their interests and stuff so I just wanted to point out that again even some of the nicest people can come off as as dicks completely by accident and it might not even have anything to do with how bad their day is or anything like that they might just be distracted out of it whatever now on the other hand and this is important too you can't just expect somebody to give a random person their full and genuine interest 24/7 right that's just rude on your part if you're doing that like it kind of reminds me of the time that a guy insisted on asking me a question while I was taking a piss right I'm out in Austin Texas and literally I'm going to the bathroom at the white horse and some guy runs in after me and my dick is out I'm like actually pissing hey you Jeff the aren't you you're Jeff yet I'm like um yeah hey man he's like hey can I ask you a question I'm like sure sure and he's like yeah and he's like but can it wait until I'm done with this and the guys like oh oh oh yeah man and then just literally stands directly behind me like like directly behind me waiting for me to finish me I'm like you'll get the fuck away from me motherfucker and like other people are laughing at 7:00 the next day somebody learning me he like made this like elaborate butthurt Facebook post about how Jeff's a dick and I never want to be like him and blah blah blah blah right so so that's kind of showing some low social intelligence on their part but you know it's kind of funny because of course that's just an average day in the life of being a so-called ylist celebrity now first off let me tell you that being on the wireless it isn't really that cool okay in fact it's sort of like being maybe a comic book artist or pro a bit character actor on Star Trek or something like I'm not getting approached by hot girls looking to hook up like Vinnie chase from Entourage or something but rather by a never-ending stream of guys although to be fair I have had a couple of female groupies so to speak you know who you are I love ya but but it's mostly guys so basically how it usually goes I'll see guys like sort of staring at me in my peripheral vision looking a bit confused perhaps like how do I know this guy where do I know this guy from they'll either start following me around and I'll see him trying to like the else lie about it or they'll be like kind of whispering to their friends I'll just screen and then they finally come over and say hi right there's also been a couple times where I'm in the nightclub and I'll have a guy like to show up and be like oh is your name Jeffy as though he doesn't know right I'm like yes I'm Jeffy and he'll start like jumping around like 15 guys come out of the woodwork and started like taking pictures and stuff so look I mean this is all very funny to me and in fact okay I find it's very very amusing and a lot of times the conversations will revolve around things like you know I saw how you ordered your pizza from the cashier that was that was smooth bro right or hey man answer me honestly is my pot do I look alpha is like my body language alpha or you know hey bro I bet you'd probably get this all the time but you know I just love to see you just Lord this club right now just like take it over man just like lord over this whole club right or what's another one so hey what club are you guys going to later you know I don't want to actually take the program or anything but you know I just like to follow you around it maybe maybe observe but but like I said it is pretty funny to me if you actually think about it my life is totally absurd but still I've seen a lot of other guys who have high profiles in this so-called community expressed frustration about having lost their privacy and I could definitely say that despite it being kind of funny or whatever I've developed that but it took me a long time to get myself to this point where I try to make it a point to be very cool to engage the guys to come up in a respectful way but like I said sometimes I still slip up but to be honest when I first came into this position several years ago it was a huge huge adjustment to me I mean it mess with my head a lot of very deep levels and there were a lot of challenges that I absolutely was not equipped to deal with when I first got into this kind of position and the first and foremost was just the objectification that you encounter when you start to get a little bit of status whether it's in my situation or any other situation for that matter and what objection the objectification means is that people view you as a source of value rather than a human being basically they're interacting with you through this lens of what can they get from you and it's kind of funny I'll often joke with girls who know about my channel who know about RSD or my media peccadilloes or whatever and they want to hang out me and I'm like you don't even want to hang out with me you just want to like hang out you know hang out with the circus freak and poke him with a stick right you don't know what it feels like to be treated like this object which is kind of funny because in the process of learning pickup which I initially undertook for the express purpose of objectifying women actually I learned what it feels like to be objectified and this ironically actually helped my game immensely but but yeah you know if they're cool with you a lot of times it's not you that they like but the idea of who you are and the status or skills or value that they could get by being around you and this does mess with you on a core level because your sense of I guess value as a human being is being tampered with now on the other hand if they're not cool with you it's usually because they're getting some kind of like you know artificial ego kick out of it like back in the day a lot of times guys would come up to me and they'd be super cool and and friendly and then the next day I'd go on the internet and I'd look and I'd see this guy writing something like I met this Jeffie guy in the street yesterday he's a fucking Punk he didn't even do an approach he's just a regular guy like me what a fucking loser you know a faker whatever it's like look it's not that I was a big you know it was a big deal to me or anything like that like oh god my worldview is broken by this random internet person because you know we always say never care what anybody thinks about you but it was weird because when I was initially interacting with these people they seemed like a decent person I had a good conversation with them and it kind of started to make me a little bit paranoid like whenever I talk to people I was like do I have to be analyzing everything I say through some kind of like weird lens so if you understand how Eagle works you'll know that the essence of a hater is a guy who thinks that anyone you know is popular must be an idiot he has to come up with a rationalization for why he's better than them so the whole mindset is if this guy's a pickup artist I must be a super a pickup artist right they're basically looking for reference points to sort of like pole-vault mentally pull balls themselves mentally even if those reference points are delusional now with girls it's even kind of wackier and oftentimes I'll be talking to a girl who knows about RSD and she'll say something I can tell you're doing your your tricks right I can tell you're doing your manipulation like you're doing your little lines here right it's not gonna work on me of course you know and and and of course I'm not even doing anything I'm just like conversing normally and then maybe later on when I don't try to actually get her in bed she actually gets angry because she didn't get the validation now other times I'll meet girls who this is even weirder whose boyfriends or guys their width will make the stupid stupid mistake of saying look at this guy don't talk to this guy he's like this evil player like what do you think the result that is well they'll approach me and you know try to see what I'm gonna do and then when I don't do anything they'll kind of push harder and harder to get a reaction out of me and of course you can only guess where that ends up going and sometimes the boyfriend will even like literally send this even dumber we'll send the girl to approach me which is literally about the dumbest thing that I can actually do because in the girlfriends unconscious mind it's registering that this guy is actually reacting to me so the thing is when you're in a position with a lot of visibility a lot of times people just have a hard time being normal around you and it's very very rarely like oh yeah I met Jeffy I met that guy he's a chill dude whatever it's either one or two things it's like oh I met him he's a legend or I met that guy he's a fucking dick I hate him he looks like a motherfucking bird all right no matter what the response is it's going to be somehow emotional now I know it maybe it sounds cool to have people looking up to you but the thing is you could never ever live up to the hype because you're only human so they're always either gonna be disappointed or maybe even bitter when they find out that you know this guy they've been like following dogmatically isn't as infallible as they actually thought and beyond that the other major kind of mind fuck is that you'll get like surrounded by a lot of these yes men and this is weird because I've learned the hard way that your only real friends are the ones who have literally nothing to gain from hanging out with you right other than to just hang out and chill and relate to you and just have a good time so if a guy or a person wants or needs something from you it's kind of difficult to gauge what their actual personality is like until that whole status dynamic has come into equilibrium and then and only then do you start to see what the person actually is actually like who that person really is and look this is not to say that you should just assume the worst of people you should become this cynical person who assumes that everyone's out to get something from you or that people are you know people are jerks or something like that but rather that you should just you know sort of enjoy the camaraderie aspects and reserve judgment until there's kind of more of a history in place and the same the same applies to two girls as well right and that's funny because where did I learn that well I learned that from them not to put undue emotional weight to a relationship that hasn't that doesn't deserve it quite yet so the direction I'm taking this is I eventually got to a point where I actually had major trust issues with people and in a way I became kind of emotionally closed off and this manifested like I would feel defensive or paranoid you know like when I met people I'd had to be mr. charisma had to be on all the time you know even when I was out just like getting a bite to eat or a taco or something and it was kind of like being in this like whirlwind where I couldn't really distinguish who my real friends were anymore so think of it like being almost surrounded by this fog where you're trying to see what's going on you're trying to keep yourself moving forward but your reality is being constantly kind of pressed upon and messed with so I'm sure that you've all heard of success barriers right what our success barriers again just literally that sort of a mental block that's preventing you from getting success and a lot of people think of this as negative but a lot of the time with like say for example in business you're what's like the conventional wisdom you're supposed to always do the things that are the best for the company right like scale it up as much as possible expand brand awareness get like noticed etc etc and like I said from a business perspective that's totally in line with the dogma of like the only purpose of a company is to maximize profit for their shareholders right it makes perfect sense so you know if I have an opportunity to increase my visibility that seems like the right thing to do but what if you're not ready to be a piece of public property yet so point is this there's a very good reason often times that these success barriers exist in your mind and a lot of time it's just to prevent you from going insane from this like jarring shift so a high-visibility individual is typically a special person in the sense that they're capable of dealing with this tsunami of social pressure that's coming at them all the time right from you know the various public opinions etc etc and to still to still be able to keep their sense of reality intact now some people might be born with this others are able to cultivate it over time but fundamentally there are a lot of people who just aren't ready for it and these people will end up going in a kind of self-destruct mode so look I'm sure there's a lot of guys watching this that are saying to themselves yeah I could deal with this no problem at all but until you've actually been in this position it's you know you're basically just talking out your ass so in my case I've never really searched out major spotlight I've never really searched out like Fame or something like that I've just personally just focused on doing my thing trying to cultivate some real skills at Publix making some real substance how to be charismatic on stage how to be charismatic on camera here how do I do that by doing it by keeping a put it you know continuing to put out videos by traveling all the time doing these free tours because look my view has always been that I've always felt that when it comes to the spotlight so to speak the people who are actually going to achieve longevity or the people who have authenticity and the people who actually don't have authenticity those are the people they're gonna be the you know the passing fad the one-hit wonder the kind of flash-in-the-pan that comes and goes so look man I'm pretty cocky about my strengths but I also know my limitations and I have many of them and but I'm always like trying to have a game plan in place to progressively chip away at them and I gotta say over time I feel that I've really come into equilibrium with all this stuff and I've learned I guess you'd say the ins and outs of my position and I've become pretty astute at being able to read people when they come up see where they're coming from etc etc and I think it's also been especially important for me to learn from other people who have walked the same path and your mentors etc and most of them have been through this as well right and it's kind of funny to be talking to some of the like my older mentors or even mentors who were just further along in the path and you know they'll say stuff like I bet this this and this happen to you and I'm like damn how did you actually know that well of course it's because it's happened to everybody right there's a universal principle that you probably have heard you know it's that you what is it the more personal wound the more universal it probably is which means that when you understand that other people have been through the same thing this allows you to stop identifying with it on such a personal level and just realize that it's part of a larger you know age-old story and in terms of what I'm talking about right here well I'm talking about it because I want other people who might go through what I went through to achieve that same level of comprehension that same level of understanding so I think that how I want to wrap this up is to offer the core insights that I've taken from all this and just to kind of like make them very crystal clear for you so here it goes what I have learned about being in a high-visibility role so that was all like a lengthy prayed preamble to the actual content here which is this number one always assume the best in people okay never let old wounds make you this jaded cynical person that's assuming the worst okay why when you start to think that way what does it become it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and it essentially ensures that you're gonna get treated that way alright so that's number one number two is this the best way to talk to people when you're meeting new people or just meeting anyone for that matter is to make yourself fully open to them right don't put pressure on yourself to act a certain way to play the role that they might expect from you or whatever the greatest gift that you can really give to people is to be fully present and fully listen to what they have to say and this is one of the things that people say about ex-president Bill Clinton you know regardless of what your your take on his politics is Clinton was well known to be extremely charismatic individual and people would say when they met him when he shake your hand you really had the feeling that he was giving you his a complete attention as though you were the only person in the room with him right so that's number two number three is this be the kind of guy who people would hang out with regardless of your so-called status okay there's an old trap that you might have heard about that when you get status a lot of people will start acting badly why because you know that you can get away with it right and then you wind up in this constant cycle of people who are coming into your life and then they just leave when they feel that they've gotten all the value right so ask yourself would you hang out with yourself if it weren't for the so-called status and if the answer is no then you actually need to make a change and we've seen this with like assistants and things of that nature where in the past I might've been a bit of a diva deal it like oh you're snoring like actually that's pretty bad I can't I can't deal with guys snoring that's still pet peeve if you don't wanna be an assistant you snore I will probably throw things at you and your sleep but you know stuff like get the bags or just being a jerk and then what would happen like I thought you were my friend six months later when they feel they've literally got and learned all they could from hanging out in the boot camp so these guys just go nowadays I find assistants hang around we become friends after because I've tried to work on that aspect of myself okay number four always remember that the people who love your work are the ones who put you in the position you're in so appreciate them with basically everything you got like never allow yourself to think of them as an inconvenience to you and inconvenience to your chill time because these people are the reason for your chill time the fact that you actually have chill time is only because of them okay number five create a route and this is very important creating a routine that's as normal as possible outside the craziness so have buddies who you know you hang out with and and who really don't connect with you on that level or you knew before you got into that status point right like I have a lot of my civilian friends are like when I'm hanging out on my off time here in San Francisco my civilian buddies these are guys that I've known for 20 25 years and they know very little about what I do for work and they don't care like to them it's essentially as though I work at the bank or something but like oh yeah Jeff's thing whatever right so when I hang out with these guys I don't talk I don't talk to them about my job I just hang out with them unlike a peer friend level so I again I have a very normal lifestyle another thing is don't get wrapped up and reading like haterade comments whether it's on the YouTube comments whatever some forums etc I mean look I get it sometimes that's absolutely necessary for feedback but if you're just getting hammered for love no constructive criticism just ignore it I mean you'd be amazed how when you're just like getting crucified on the forum or in a press like press articles if you don't read it it's as though it doesn't exist which allows you to continue operating at your best right so again you could believe it or not you can maintain a fully normal life just by going about your job and viewing all the people who know about you as this sort of like extended family almost like you're living in a small town community but on a global scale and that brings me to number six which is this never take the props too seriously right these guys coming up to you saying you're an absolute legend mate etc etc that stuff's great I mean it's good to appreciate it but don't take it too seriously why because if you take that seriously then you've got to take the criticism seriously as well so as long as you know who you are that has to be enough and you're always gonna have a few people who you actually really connect with and who really connect with your stuff and who actually you know are the true fans but again the vast majority right the vast majority are gonna be like frightening frightening leaf fickle I guess I would say it's trying to say that three times fast and they'll again they'll jump ship very very quickly if something better comes along and look that's just fine just do you now number seven and this is a big one as well strive to continually improve and grow and offer more and more value now I know I've felt this before that temptation it's very very strong to just create something and then kind of coast by on your laurels which you know if you give in to that that temptation you're gonna be constantly paranoid about being shoved aside by the hot new thing replaced etc etc if you if you're continually innovating you're never gonna have to think about that and that's been a huge lesson for me and in fact I'll probably end up doing like another separate video just entirely on that topic about how to stay engage once you've already had success but again put a pin in that for another time okay number eight always be proactive and solve the larger issue by continuing to grow instead of reacting and trying to protect what you wrongly believe is this sort of like finite amount of creative material so here's the thing like I've had situations where I came up with an idea or I put something out and then I saw another guy maybe an RC maybe a colleague of mine say a very very similar thing in a video or almost kind of bite my idea right but here's the thing like I just view it as this inevitable aspect of having arrived if you will and it's never gonna stop there's nothing you can do about it right and here's the thing nobody cares who came up with an idea right nobody gives a shit they only care who offers them the most value so use that energy you would spend like you know making a stink about who's you know who was the original creator to actually go out and make more and more and more content and just offer more and more value okay what are we on now number nine forget about status forget about coolness forget about all that kind of stuff okay stay true to your real core group of friends and you know know what's authentic from what's hollow okay so if you look at the people who have stayed relevant for a very very long time you know in our in our culture you'll see that a lot of time these people surround themselves like their crew if you were to see their crew they don't look as cool as they do they like they maybe look dorky okay they might even have a girlfriend or a wife who isn't like a perfect ten and there's a good reason for that okay it's because they're real so for example you know if you look at like Snoop Dogg's wife super like huge celebrity mate massive star you know super rich super value if you look at his actual like wife she's like just like some normal chick from the hood or whatever you're like well I thought snoop would do it's like no this was the girl that was down with him before he was famous and he can like trust these people so again have that sort of like inner circle a cadre of people that you actually trust okay now number ten know what it means to be quote-unquote grounded okay humble down-to-earth whatever you want to call it so those are just kind of three expressions that you should consider to be your life line if you will to the so-called real world and if you'd like a fourth expression well it would be know how to laugh at yourself and that's been a huge one for me right because if it's like kind of like Eminem like what can you say about this guy that he hasn't already said about himself and I've sort of like adopted that mentality about it as well so that's pretty much yet hopefully you can take some nuggets of wisdom out of this and apply it to your life regardless of whether or not you're in this high profile value position or not and I got to say it's been a crazy trip these past 16 years Lars D and I honestly feel like the best is yet to come as I continue to go out there do what I love and grow as a speaker grow as a teacher all that all that good stuff so the next big thing on my plate by the way it's something that I'm tentatively calling charisma mastery which is going to be a broad spectrum program that's designed to kind of methodically cultivate all aspects of what we would call charisma which is of course that nebulous quality that makes people attractive not just a potential sex partners but to business associates friends and just everyday people that you interact with in your daily life so I'm putting a ton a ton of ton of research and develop into this project much of the same way that I did with execute the program a while back so at this time there is no concrete release date but when it does come out I really am intending this for to blow everyone away okay at the level of detail the level of attention I'm going to put into this so check it out like I said it's not gonna be out there's no concrete release date but you can get on the SuperDuper early VIP list right now by heading over to charisma master e.com anyway Jeffie and i'll see you next time,oaTD6O7fiRA
hello there welcome to yet another edition of between Tudors Tsuboi Jeffy and a coming at you today from in-between Tudors and what we're going to do today is going to take a little reader mail okay you know I get these letters emails every day some are from outraged citizens upset over the content of our videos some are enquiries about penis pills and then we actually actually get actual letters from viewers just like yourself so I want to dip into the mailbag again today and read one off right now so this guy says hey Jeffy I just wanted to say you shit's fuckin killer dude laugh my ass off funny I think your frame for going out and doing pickup is awesome it's like you just go out and have a lot of fun and break a bunch of shit and pickup is supposed to be fun hooah I'm at the level where I can consistently approach and consistently get conversations to open but what I can't do yet is generate attraction I often just wind up in a going nowhere conversation in field till it's only a matter of time before I pick this up but I'd like a professional angle if you can help me I'll be all ears hooah Mike so seeing this letter right here really makes my day I love when I read stuff like that because a lot of times I go out and I you know I've been traveling the world for many years and I need people and they tell me man I love your your posts I love your videos I love reading your reports and I tell them I'm like well thank you I enjoy living them the implication being you don't want to live vicariously through your life fucking RSD Heroes you know you want to get out there and do yourself that's the whole point you just don't want to be one of these guys that just like you know obsesses over uh you know MMA videos or something but never actually goes my practice jiu-jitsu or you know a guy who is super into watching sports but never plays them so Mike sounds like you're actually actually out there taking action so fucking kudos on now let's move on to your question so first off you say that you're able to open consistently if you're having difficulty generating attraction so what I'm going to do here I'm going to list a few of the most common causes of this issue and this is a pretty common issue among guys who are just starting out even guys who are intermediate sometimes but the first thing that you've got to do is you got to ask yourself are you even hooking these girls in the first place okay so what does hook mean hook means you go up to the girl and at first she's thinking who the fuck is this person why is he talking to me well when you get that social hook point that's when they go from thinking who the fuck is this person why is he talking to me to okay this guy's cool let's hear what he has to say more let's continue speaking with them now this can happen instantaneously or it can take up to a couple of minutes but the most important thing that I see when I when I see guys who aren't even getting to the social hook point who are getting like these insta blowouts or these like super short interactions for the girl excuse themselves like a couple of minutes tops is these guys they simply aren't swinging through and this is something I've talked about quite a bit you know you can't just go up and drop some opener I don't care how awesome the fucking opener is let's say it's the most awesome opener in the fucking world let's say the opener is a hi I'm fuckin Brad Pitt and you're Brad Pitt okay where you look just like him uh if you just stand there and stare at her most likely she's gonna be like okay and just fuck off again the experience that I always liked related to is if you were on the street and some person came up to you was like hey man how's it going and then you're like oh hi how are you and then they just said nothing and stare to you what are you likely to do are you going to like Hello strange person let me engage you in conversation no you're probably going to be like okay have a good one man and fuck off which is precisely what the girl is going to do so again you've got to make sure that when you go up after you deliver the deliver the opener you continue to speak right you continue to talk again people will put an overemphasis on the opener I think that day I like what's the opener what's the opener what's the opener opener does not matter so much as you know openers what you say in the first fucking ten seconds what matters more is what you say in the next 45 minutes okay so you got to learn to cultivate that idea of the wouldn't call it the million dollar mouthpiece where you can just go up and blab and keep talking so ask yourself are you doing that are you doing the so-called bunt we like to however you just go up and you don't swing through so that's what's happening you have to make sure take pains to continue speaking after you open okay so that's number one now let's look at a couple of the other more frequent causes of this but the first of these is just standing too far away you know it again proximity is one great way to express intent that I'm here to pursue a romantic encounter with you as opposed to just like herd or standing four feet away again junior high dance leaving room for the Holy Ghost type shit if you see me and said if you see any other instructors and said we're pretty much right up in the fucking chicks face we cut in we get right in her face we stand directly in front okay now again I'll move in and out as the kind of rhythms of the interaction dictate but for the most part I do get right up in there okay so that's number one number two is showing too much disinterest okay a lot of guys they get this like be the prize mentality and they try to act all aloof of course the classic example from back in the day of mystery methods was like opening like over the shoulder excuse me quick question so sure like super super aloofness however again it's very easy to go too far with that yes most of the instructors that you'll see myself included when we go up we have a very sort of studied nonchalance about us right this ere the easy and difference where we don't really give a shit but again that's from that's like an internal belief that we've cultivated it's not some tactic that we're doing to try to appear aloof so again with the disinterest a little goes a long way so be cognizant if maybe you're acting like too much of a distant too much of an aloof dickhead so understand the difference between being needy and showing tentative interest rather I would say rather than show active disinterest you'd like to show tentative interest I guess that's a better way to put it okay so the next one is going to be simply moving the scent forward ok moving the set forward now a lot of guys will just go in and yeah maybe they do get to pass the open but then they just sit there and they just fucking hurt curved or around with the girl right you have to understand that pickup is a process with steps and at any given moment you need to be aware of where you are in the interaction currently and what is the next step that you need to get to to take it to that romantic zone that romantic level ok so again be moving things forward at all times of course take the proper time to do so but again you need to know where you're at in that timeline and start moving things forward so again it's open generate attraction build comfort and figure out logistics and pull okay so the next point that leads to these nowhere sets as I like to call them is too much group or friending now look when you open a girl it is in fact very important to get the peer groups attention this is vital because if the friendzone like you at the end of the night they're not going to be helping you out in fact they'll even be reinforcing her fears of that like specter of social consequence for appearing promiscuous and they can really sink your ship so yeah you got to go up and you do you should interact with them on some level to where they go ok this guy's cool this guy gets it this guy's cool he's not a fucking creeper you know we like him and we support this however it's easy to take this too far as well I've seen times where you know the the fat friends there and the guys are go P R group or friending so he starts pro fronting the peer group the the so-called you know the less attractive girl and the next thing you know is the girl he's actually into kind of slinks away like oh let's give Wendy let's get fat Amy a chance to fucking have love right and then you're there with fat Amy which again I've seen pitch-perfect fat Amy she's a great great person but I probably want to you know copulate with her or smell her naked for that matter but but anyway so get the peer groups approval and then let it be okay the next one is number five being more flirtatious okay now again I know that when you're going in there a lot of times you want to have that'll do for parents related to that other one but again when I say flirtatious you have to start layering in that dick so to speak she needs to know like because otherwise you can go in there and you can be doing like great conversation you can be a super funny guy you can be hitting like attraction spikes and everything but if she can't feel that there's actual dick behind just gonna be like where's the beef right so again if you just have the party guy then your new friend to go shopping for cardigans with so what do I mean by adding a flirtation basically we're talking about adding in intent so what mantle in communications so the five channels of man to woman communication as I've stated many times before is for a brief little refresher course here are as follows number one eye contact number two proximity number three vocal tonality number four verbal escalation they hate verbal flirtation statements of the ten and number five physicality so again make sure you're you're communicating on all five of those channels otherwise that flirtatious is just simply not going to be there now last but not least here and again these are just kind of off the top of my head is not calibrating to the energy of the set now when you go up you kind of want to match their energy level maybe be a little bit higher okay sometimes it can be a little bit lower but you generally want to kind of be on the same wavelength as they are when you actually step up okay so what do I mean by that look there are different levels of energy that you can bring you go up and you can be like oh hey kids you know the sort of bouncing all over the place guy on the gummiberry juice or you can be the mr. kind of like good evening like the most interesting man in the world type shit now both of these can bring an intensity that's the thing no matter what energy level that you're bringing you want to also bring a density to it so and the classic example of this that within analogy I suppose that we used to explain this is the example of the burning bonfire versus the searing coal okay so the burning bonfire would obviously be the more higher energy like dance club type approach where you're you know you're like all over the place there's a lot of visual stimulation you're again there's a lot of stimulation there writes crackling it's it's it's exciting okay it gives off heat now again think of the searing white-hot cold it's not as like visually stimulating there's not as much going on but it also gives off an intense heat the point with this is that when you're approaching you want to be contributing something to the set as opposed to being like an energy leech right so let's get regardless of whether you go high energy lower energy you want to be contributing something of value again look at all your sets through the following lens were you a going up and like adding energy to the interaction are you leeching energy from the interaction right were you trying to weasel your way into their party or are you actually already having the party and bring it to them now again these are some of the more common reasons that I can think of for these kind of nowhere sets where you open and it's kind of a polite conversation it doesn't go anywhere but the bottom line where what are most of these reasons here that I've listed what's kind of the root cause of these most of them come from a fear of being rejected right a fear of being rejected because again a lot of times a fear of ground zero as we like to call it because lot of times you're in there the girl likes you you think oh shit it's going good if I try to push it to the nice level and move it forward you know communicate his man to woman or any of these other things you know even continuing to talk after the opener what's that fear it's like the fear of putting your personality on the line many many guys need to the point where they can open consistently and it was something they couldn't do before and so they're happy with it but again they have then they have that fear of losing that happy feeling so they don't move things forward even though the end goal is not just a standard have a nice conversation the end goal is to get laid right this makes no logical sense yet people do it anyway so again Mike if you're watching this and anyone else watching this take a look at these things I've listed see if any of them apply to your game currently and take pains to make that change it's been Jeffy coming at you again in between Tudors and I'll see you next time on ours deviation  you,obci7c9qpNI
yo yo yo what up boy well hi I'd like to welcome you today to this edition of the real social dynamics Jeffie video blog so welcome now I mean a lot of guys in my travels with RSD and when I say that I mean I do mean a lot okay over the past 10 years doing this job I have personally trained up over a thousand guys just like yourself and have helped them improve their game to levels that they never thought imaginable I've also written thousands of articles and field reports and even had a book published about my experiences in the game and some of the stuff you know in that book is so crazy that a lot of people think that they should make a television program about my life and in lieu of that at least we have this but the thing is a lot of the guys I meet on program have read my book and they almost always ask me like how the hell do you get away with all these wild shenanigans okay and the answer is congruence now this is a term that we'd like to toss around all the time we talk about having success with women but few people truly understand it so why is congruence important and how does it translate to social intelligence let's explore that today  [Music]  the first thing that I tell any of my students is that the very first thing I tell them is this before we crack into this program I'm going to have to ask you to check your ego at the door okay I want you to put aside all ideals and fears you may have with regard to interacting with women and what I want to do is I want them to understand that this is just a skill like any other and that means that first you have to get the knowledge then you must undergo a period of intense practice and repetition in other words you have to get comfortable interacting with women in all imaginal scenarios and attracting them so it becomes who you are all right as opposed to something you're doing and this is what congruence is all about so this whole period of practice and repetition this is the only way to congruently project a non scarcity mentality which is absolutely necessary for success in this area it's only through mass social experience that you can cultivate a noticeably improved level of social intelligence I mean let's face it a lot of the guys who come to this stuff are quite frankly geeks maybe you're one of them I know I certainly was when I first got into the game and I'm sure a lot of people would probably argue that I still am now but but again that's neither here nor there the problem of these guys however is that they Harbor a lot of misconceptions about what exactly it is going to take to get their game to the level that they envision it's okay for example a guy might think that all he needs to do is get this up get some knowledge in his head and it'll be all good you know he thinks that he just needs tactics and this guy he doesn't need social intelligence he doesn't need to improve his style or hygiene or grooming habits you know he doesn't need to change his lifestyle in any meaningful way you know just get the information and everything will be fine well the problem with this is that without real world experience you're simply not going to be congruent with the teachings all right and so getting real experience in the field that's the only actual way to integrate these teachings into your life congruently so let me give you an analogy maybe remember a few years back they came out with this ab crunch machine thing that you would like strapped to your stomach and it would send these like electrical pulses into your abs when you know from the advertisements on the late-night television you basically get the impression that all you had to do was you know strap this thing on for several minutes a day blast your with with electricity and voila six-pack ABS all right well my roommate at the time he actually would have bought the damn thing and he used it religiously every day and we also came up with several other highly amusing yet unrelated uses for it but again that's another story entirely the thing is this guy he didn't change his habit his habits his diet at all nor did he do any other exercises except for the you know strap this thing on and blast the electrocute himself so what do you think happened that's right he's a fat bastard to this very day so you know so there you are I you can have all the knowledge in the world but if you are not congruent in its application you're not going to get the kind of success you want however if you take the time and put in the work to become congruent you could undergo a complete transformation you know think of the best guy do you personally know with women and now multiply that by 10 and that's what we're talking about here so you need to get out into the field once you get these tactics and techniques under your belt you know once you get the knowledge you have to get out of the field you need to become congruent and this will happen with time most people are actually cool like when you get to know that most people are pretty cool but they just don't know how to convey it and that is what social intelligence is all about and for many becoming congruent with the image of somebody at ease interacting with and subsequently having sex with the woman that they just met is a process of döner de fication okay and that means making a conscious effort to change your lifestyle choices and make choices that would be consistent with someone who has a lot of success with women and that means what that means going out to the club instead of having a you know call of duty land party all right that means actually having female friends instead of masturbating to internet pornography all right means hanging out with your Bros shooting the breeze you know having a couple beers as opposed to you know obsessively checking your facebook all day from bed and or endlessly watching videos about how to pick up girls much like this one so it means you know it means dressing like a cool guy instead of having the threads of the insurance salesman Employee of the Month all right this makes sense so it's important to remember in all of this however that it is just a learning experience all right there's no such thing as failure there's only feedback so you have to let go all right and letting go makes it fun which makes it more likely to work because you're not giving off bad sub communications and then you get success which in turn builds your confidence and this becomes a self-perpetuating loop so why is congruent so important well people can sense incongruity being preoccupied with trying to project high status when you don't actually feel it ironically ends up projecting low status all right follow me here what you know would you be preoccupied with how a group of children thought about you for those who are of high status and are congruent with it well this is how they view most people that's how they view everyone as they go through the world so but if you're congruent you're going to come across or rather if you're not congruent you're going to come across as inauthentic you know and if you're comfortable if you're confident with what you're doing however people in many ways have no choice but to accept that it must be good if you think back to high school you know the cool kids quote unquote where people you know these people could do whatever they wanted no matter how ridiculous and everyone would accept it unquestioningly right they could come to school wearing like a chic headdress and most likely within a week many people would be sporting the same thing so anyway - something's up congruence is key and this whole process as I've said many many times before in these videos isn't necessarily a destination but more of a journey and over the course of that journey you're going to change a lot of your beliefs about identity deserving this and what's possible all right and that's what it's all about so I think I want to go get sample some local New Orleans cuisine maybe some alligator some gumbo some shrimp po-boys of some sort a muffle odds to sandwich I don't know how to pronounce that is it is it just me or like do it every time I do these videos like ended by telling them what I'm going to go eat I guess filming these builds up an appetite so having said that champagne wishes and caviar dreams and I'll see you next time education and leisure and photography check on future to feature confusion and create confusion confusion confusion this looks very healthy  Oh,onuqkmhhJXM
hey hey hey welcome to my first video as a subject in god Edward Trump's of New America now you know I'm not overly political on this channel you know that if you watch this but you know this is such a world-shaking event that has happened with the election of Donald Trump that I figured I kind of have to say something about it and the fact is I called it I called it I knew from the second that he came down that escalator last June at Trump Tower that he was gonna win the election and nobody believed me they're like haha lol Jeff but I was right and I'm not happy I was right but it is what it is first off let me just state I personally didn't vote for Trump primarily because I do not believe that an internet troll should be the president no you can call me old-fashioned but having said that I think that the people who didn't want Trump to win I think that they fucked up you know and they fucked up by focusing on his character issues instead of you know his qualifications I don't remember anybody asking him mr. Trump explained how a bill gets passed mr. Trump what are the three branches of the federal government likes things that would expose his lack of qualification no instead it was this like rabid hyperventilating foaming at the mouth calling him oh my god oh my god just sexist he's a racist he's a fascist oMG we're all gonna die I think beyond that people just couldn't stop insulting his voters you know it couldn't resist they just had to do it he's had to insult the voters and you know I've felt the backlash to this recent phenomenon of like a super overzealous political correctness I felt that building for a while now and that was the major reason that I predicted Trump would win unlike a lot of people who might be watching this who just like live in a big city and stay in that big city I travel all over the country all the time every year for my job and I felt that sentiment building and maybe you still don't get it but a very large chunk of Trump's popularity is out of protest to left learning left-leaning bias and left leftist circle jerking right if you looked like his polls went up after every controversial thing he said none of that had any negative effect on him whatsoever maybe this led you to believe well okay well clearly the Trump supporters they're stupid they're brainwashed racist sexist etc and while for very many of them that might be true something different was happening I think with most others and they're just fed up with the ridicule you know like normal intelligent people whose political affiliation excuse me would be impossible to determine unless they revealed it these people they would hear Trump say something like okay build the wall and they think well that's a bit extreme and grandiose but I do want to do something about illegal immigration and so what do they do they just kind of file it away and they put it in the back of their mind right is this stick it there and meanwhile the floodgates of circle jerking and harassment on the internet open wide and they see this like on their Facebook feeds and cetera this constant the the media attacks the personal insults the constant accusations of racists Xenophon misogynist anti-semite home and any other buzzword in the toolkit they see liberal acquaintances of theirs who might be in fact even longtime friends posting on Facebook unfriended me right now if you like Trump you fucking ignorant racists so what do they do they just shut up they just kept their mouth shut and said nothing and this this continued unbroken throughout the entire election cycle and then at a certain point if I had a pin point I would say was this summer early on they started to question the media and they started to question the establishment and this in fact I believe was the point of no return so to speak once they started questioning the media in the establishment and I and I think 2016 was finally the year that everybody learned how fucked up and biased the media actually is and this is similar to what Bernie supporters saw with Hillary favoritism so at this point they started to look into Trump even more and when they looked into him they saw things that they liked and when he says something controversial that they don't actually support well the most optimistic among them might think okay well this just seems like hyperbole to get people talking and furthermore they realized that Trump has in fact been preaching this exact same tactic for literally decades the least optimistic the the more cynical among them will think well even if he's being a hundred percent literal we still have got the checks and balances in the government so you know it doesn't really matter that's literally how that they are rationalizing all of his unpalatable aspects of themselves and meanwhile the circle drinking still continues right the constant abuse the knee-jerk hostility against anything Trump it kind of makes them feel like they can't voice their opinion in the supposedly and to free speech right they see these rallies with like Trump supporters getting fucking punched in the streets they see the media saying well Trump's campaign it's over for the the 15th time you know he shot himself in the foot this this is a beginning of the end this is it yet they see as rising popularity and deep down they know there's others that feel the same way right and this is the the silent majority you occasionally hear them talking about and at this point they they realize they recognize Trump is an underdog Trump's an underdog he's standing against very established and strong political forces you know Trump lets people speak their minds without abuse you know and every single additional media attack every clever meme every down vote Brigade Hollywood denouncement from Lena Dunham these all just strengthen their resolve they know that their vote has power and they're ready to make the establishment sweat and here we are so if you are on the Left politically and you're watching this you probably think that what I'm saying is dumb right I'm gonna you know you're like I'm fuck that I'm gonna call out racist when I see then fuck death you know put politically correct what does that mean it just means having empathy and being polite what's wrong with that why would somebody get so annoyed you know about being called out on their hurtful words you know and and I guess it does make sense with that what you're saying there but what I'm telling you here is this the this outrageous political correctness bullshit of the past several years it's actually driving people away and your failure to recognize this just handed Donald Trump the presidency you know it's just this fantasy that if you just mock people and insult them enough they'll realize the error of their ways and come around like a fucking racist and say races to him enough about you know what they're right I'm fucking racist I need to stop this shit we come on do it's fucking ridiculous this is not how human psychology works and look a lot of people are saying why are you trying to excuse this stuff the racism say you know the people who voted for them they're maybe they don't believe it but they're giving tacit approval to it I refuse to budge an inch on this data I mean okay I understand all that but look if I thought for sure that my candidate was gonna win like that Clinton's gonna win and then they didn't I would be re-examined almost everything about my belief systems I would be looking at all the things that I took for granted and I would perform an exhaustive analysis and then objectively attempt to establish exactly why had I had you know misread the situation so badly in order to prevent it from happening again in the future okay but but of course that's not what Liberals are doing instead from what I've seen again around on Facebook and so forth in the media it looks like they're just doubling down on everything that got them into this position in the first place and many people are flipping the fuck out like trippin and flip it tripping and flipping yo like many people on my Facebook feed seem to believe that they are now actually living in a genocide 'old dictatorship with Trump literally about to carry about the the mass murder of millions of Americans it's like dude come on man you guys are too far up your own asses to accurately assess what's happening and how to prevent it from happening again in 2020 okay no of course not why why the introspection it's much easier to call Trump voters races and misogynists than to reflect on the very serious failings of the Democratic Party I mean bottom line Democrats put forth a candidate who was highly unpalatable and they ignored the serious concerns of the working-class to play at identity politics that's all I'm talking about this on a Bill Maher a couple weeks ago in somebody shot you know he's talking about this exact thing and someone chimed in she's like oh my god so what you're saying is the problem with American politics that we don't cater enough to rednecks and one of the panelists replied he's like look I get what you're saying and it's right but do you want to be right or do you want to fucking win so don't shoot the messenger like I said I didn't vote for Trump I you know I think it's a bit of a travesty if fuckin joke it's quite frightening in many ways but again I'm just trying to understand exactly what happened now maybe there's a silver lining to this and that it will be the end of this social justice warrior shit although I fucking doubt it but if you don't want eight years of President Trump ya better fucking consider it which brings me to my final point now while this might seem like a nightmare and an insane nightmare too many people right now I would just say this who knows what's gonna happen right I'm reminded of that old proverb about the farmer whose horse ran away and his neighbor's like oh my god what a terrible tragedy your horse were so sorry and he's like we'll see and a week later the horse comes back and it's got several other horses like wild horses with it and they Corral them in and the neighbors again they're like oh my god what great fortune you've got all these extra horses out farmer goes we'll see so then his son is trying to tame the the new horse of the wild horses and one of them bucks the kid off and he breaks his leg badly and so the neighbors come over they're like holy shit your son his leg this is fucked you know I'm we're so sorry what terrible fortune old man says we'll see next day the the army comes up the road turns out there's a war on they're drafting all the young men to take into the army they see the kids obviously guys you know this fucked up leg so you know they they pass him over he gets a deferment exemption and they leave and then the neighbors like oh my god how what great fortune now your kid doesn't have to go to war and the farmer just looks at em and says we'll see so again who knows how this shit is gonna is gonna play out maybe he turns out to be like the best president Emperor and it was all just posturing and his you know in his campaign it granted even if it was all posturing I think that the fact that he exploited you know the the racial and various tensions that he did I think that is pretty unconscionable and the fact that it's embolden bona fide racist to act out in the wake of his win and I know there's been a lot of fake stories of you know hoaxes about that but I've known people who actually experienced this my friends Chinese he was on SFO and some old guy was like go back to your country he's like I was born in Berkeley dude what the fuck are you talking about so I mean you know my other friend had as someone was like some old guy in the in like the Central Valley was like rude to his daughter because she looks Mexican etc so so look I know this stuff is generally it's generally going down people are genuinely afraid genuinely afraid but again who knows we'll see how this continues to play out I mean maybe on the other hand maybe he's so so terrible that it just it causes both of the parties to unite and move forward in a positive direction in other words they're like you know after four years of just completely horrible politics everyone's just like look Republicans Democrats I know we've had our differences but that that can never happen again and then they decide to move forward in a wonderful positive direction and we all ascend to Valhalla or something who knows we'll see it's been Jeffy and I'll see you next time,p9V8KV5aphg
you can leave that here I might make my own fucking Venn diagram holy shit okay well there's a lot of people in here and as such I'm a little concerned that we're going to have a a great white situation when I set off my pyrotechnics and everyone may die so this might be your last night on earth so relish it enjoy it so you know I just walked in on the tail end his thing and I'd like to touch on what he said because it reminds me of you know discussion I was having with a student earlier this week so many times I see this kind of shit where and you'll see it on forums you'll see it on the inner circle groups where guys are asking these questions about minutiae right little minut bullshit details like what do I do if the girl does this do you think that sometimes girls will flake as a shit test do you think this do you think that in this situation should I do this what these guys fail to understand I I can I can give these guys the answers to every single minut question or scenario that arises you know as they come up okay here's the solution to this here's the solution to this but it really is the difference between giving the guy a fish and teaching the guy to fish right because if he's simply looking and being reactive to these situations as they arise he's always going to be on the back foot right he's never going to have the fucking answer he's never going to have the magical key the rosetta stone if you will that is going to unlock the root cause because look I believe in treating root causes to these kind of problems and not addressing symptoms right individual my new problems as they arise with girls scenarios those are symptomatic of a deeper issue which is that the guy internally does not have the inner game he does not have the mindset that is predisposing him to respond to these things correctly naturally right so then you see things like what he alluding to you know a guy gets the girl's number and he doesn't return her call you don't know he doesn't hit her up for three days so it looks like he's not needy okay so it looks like he has cool shit going on in his life well how about you actually fucking have cool should go in on your life how about you're actually non-needy see the thing is when you do game a really long time like me for example you know I've been doing this job for twelve and a half years now I had this student on boot camp the other week and he had just turned 21 I was like I was like when I started doing this job you were nine years old you know so put that in fucking perspective but you know when you've done this and that you bang three hundred girls what tends to happen is you you become like a girl in many ways and what that means is you have a period every month but no you you really you get kind of a tune to the life's to the life that they lead right in other words you have tons of options you have a deluge of female attention you have competing girls hitting you up on your phone that want to get a piece of your time every fucking day you know what happened to us dead data how how are you stranger shit like that I see this this pops up on the daily on my fucking phone but I don't respond to this shit why do you think that is no because I can't I don't have enough fucking time I literally don't I'm either on some fucking plane come to see you faggots I'm like you know I'm like I'm going out with another girl I gotta like put out this fire over here I got work here I got my t-shirt business that's just recently stopped hemorrhaging cash at an alarming rate so that's nice so I'm making money but at least it's not hemorrhaging cash anymore um you know I got a lot of shit on my plate right you know I've got little small tests about the home refinishing a teak chair should of that nature okay but the thing is you have to understand it puts you into the my instead of a girl right you need to be the guy you need to be the hot chick that has you know lots of girls vying for his attention jockeying for his attention so it's not even a question of like being a dick like I'm not gonna return her to come it's more like you just fucking forget so once you have internalized or rather started living that kind of lifestyle you don't fucking get butthurt when girls do the little Mickey Mouse shit because you do it too you know what I mean you understand it's not a consequence of them purposely being these spiteful cunts it's not that at all it's simply that they don't have fucking time for this shit they forget they're not even thinking that shit you know meanwhile you're like waiting by the phone plotting your next fucking text consulting me consulting the inner circle so you really want to be striving no obviously this is one of those things where you know yeah if you're just starting off and you don't have ten girls calling you up every to suck your dick then how could I internalize that belief system well you know there is the old fake it till you make it which is still viable to this day but you want you know so you can as he said emulate these behaviors but ultimately you want to get to a point where you're you're actually moving towards that because your identity as it were is something that is quite fluid okay it's a very slow-moving fluid however it will move if you continually apply the stimulus the pressure you know to direct it down the path you want it to go you know and this is something that gets said ad nauseam in RSD but no one is cut from a different cloth you know you look at this guy I've known you a long fucking time huh most like a decade now huh and he was a fucking nerd fat nerd you know I could I could barely pipe in in a conversation with my friends 12 years ago you know they'd be talking about you know I wrote some pretty alpha dudes and they'd be like having some conversation like you're my opinion buddies talk over me you know and over time I mean you're old you're fundamental personality isn't going to change you're going to become like some some Jekyll and Hyde character or some demonic version of self or something like that well maybe but but you know the care you start to bolster the characteristics that are going to be more conducive to success in cold approach pickup okay because we all have different facets to our personality for example you know you have an adventurous side you have a conservative side you have a humble side you have a narcissistic side you have a respectful side you have an irreverent side okay now when I wake up in the morning and I brush my fucking teeth I look in the mirror and I'm like there's Jeff work in progress like everyone else okay but when I'm when I hit the fucking Club uh-huh it's Jeff fucking Alan bitch like straight it like straight up you know straight up I think I'm the shit I think I'm fantastic okay like I will literally almost never it's difficult for me in set to shut the fuck up because I love the noises that are emanating from my fucking flapping meat hole do you understand like literally what I'm like talking to the girl and just this kind of goes back to um you know essentials of verbal game which what is the meat and potatoes of verbal game well it's what we call fighting now vibing is simply a non goal-oriented conversation that is designed to do one thing and one thing alone to pump emotional state both yours and hers so while you're speaking with the girl a good gauge for whether or not your words are coming from the right place is to kind of install almost a watcher or a guardian like in your brain that kind of observes and says where are my words coming from right now are they coming from a the place of I hope she stays and keeps talking to me golly I hope it works I hope it works okay are they coming from be the place of fucking around self-amusement verbal vomiting no filter no filter let the fucking chips fall where they may Ronna CLE once you let go of needing it to work it you'll tend to have better success the conversations will tend to flow more smoothly it'll be more natural you'll be more witty right and I constantly have to tell new guys this because they want to know what do I say what are the lines give me a line now do I have lines of course yet I have fucking lines okay but the thing is I'm not clinging to them as a crutch I'll bust him out just like you know a guy it's more akin to like a guy to barbecue but I got man tell the story with the fucking thing when the the dog and about oh yeah well anyway one day it was good and everyone enjoys the story but as he's not saying that because he doesn't know what else to say he's saying it because he enjoys telling the story and B he enjoys connecting with people when they they enjoy the story themselves so I always tell these guys like I said to this kid the other week I go um he's like what do I say what do I say I'm like do you have close friends and he's like yes I always have to ask that cuz one one guy said this he was like I don't have any close friends as I go I was like do you cuz I was like do you run out of things to say when you're with your close friends like I have no close friends much okay well then okay um but yeah no I mean you typically don't like for example I'm hanging out with evil Jimmy I don't give a fuck with this guy thinks right you know I we bust on each other all the time not trying to impress evil Jimmy so if I'm just sitting there slang and shit back and forth we're gonna come up with like hilarious little jokes and and little insights and things like that it's gonna flow off the tongue very naturally so you know I always talk us it's not adding on it's a letting go okay there's a game that we play sometimes in the club because I feel it's very important when you're at Ewan pickup that you're priming your physiology to be in a good state for it okay so what does that mean well it means that if I'm in the club you're very very rarely going to see me standing there like this like you know like like staring into the middle distance with a with a derp look on my face derping derping hard you know I'll frequently see students doing this like I'll you know I'll have three students okay this guy's doing gay this guys doing good where's the third and you'll find them kind of like like wandering around the club like a fucking zombie in fact that's that's big that's doing a disservice to zombies okay is this something different that's much more much more disturbing and he's like he's like we call it a sauntering salmon and he's like just salmon around the club like derping and I'm like dude how was this conducive to you now going up and it somehow adding energy to the girls night adding energy to the interaction as opposed to leeching off of them and asking them to somehow buoy or stayed up right so a big thing that I took from Anthony Robbins is the idea that motion creates emotion so if I'm in the club and you know it's pickup night out you'll see me there a bare minimum I'll be like just tapping my foot that's it just to the music very very simple tapping my feet to the beat of the music maybe getting the head in there a little bit maybe doing some other shit shrieking some gibberish throwing shit around wearing a weird headdress singing some song okay but the point is I'm getting involved in the environment do you guys know what uh the Calgary Stampede is what's the biggest rodeo in North America every July up in Calgary Alberta Canada and when you go up there it's all fucking yeehaw right like dude I don't like that shit but when I'm up there it's like save horse ride a cowboy whoo like I'm the biggest fucking cowboy there I don't listen to that shit right but again I want to be sort of one with the environment I want to be enjoying the environment I look around I say what's cool about this place you know even if it's like some shithole dive bar I'll be like Tim's the coolest shit he'll die bar their bid yeah right or another game that like so kind of getting back to the point I was up hanging out with evil Stifler one night and we were there we'd have done a couple of approaches but then it was kind of early in the night so the crowd hadn't arrived yet so we're waiting for it to populate and as we're standing there we don't want to appear like you know just a couple of CHO just and they're like value scanning right like where's the value where's five so he turns to me and he begins to have a fake conversation with me where he's just reeling off gibberish okay and we call this game five because what you do is you literally just kind of blank your mind and you start saying what literally whatever comes to mind like I'll do it right now pomegranate penguin Obamacare hydrangea persimmon vocabulary edium otic research with 17 things because you know Obama goes down there all the time you know Abu Oscar the fucking Grouch lives on a fucking trashcan you know down there Los Angeles Lakers purple crayon purple monkey five right and then when you say five then it's the other guys turn to save this shit now some I'll play that game with students and sometimes they can't even do it they'll be like stuff in fact at hotseat there's an exercise that we often do where we'll pair up and groups we're like you know put the guys together in groups and then they'll go around and each guy as it comes around you have just have to say one word the first word that comes to your mind so think it'll be like you know pumpkin Orca the white house giraffes idiom colloquialism like Andals go around go around go around but some guys it'll get to the guy and he can't fucking think of anything why can't that guy think of anything the right thing to say see he can't something he can't think of anything he's concerned that if he allows his psyche to simply generate a random word and he blurts it out it might say something embarrassing about him or it might say something that other the other people don't think is cool okay so essentially what this is it's coming from that place of do you like me do you like me which is like a cellar frame right that's what Tyler cuz a cellar frame is opposed to the buyer frame now seller frame is shit for a number of reasons okay look I want you to understand there's a difference between sales and marketing you do not want to be selling yourself but it's okay to present the best version of yourself and allow the chips to fall where they may you know what I mean like fucking Mercedes doesn't need a like set like the cachet of the brand itself make someone want that Mercedes okay so for example so you know again if we're talking about like it all comes back to sub communications really right what are you sub communicating and you guys are what sub communications mean because that's a that's a key word that gets kind of bandied about quite a bit sub communications basically communication is the literal words you're saying and the literal ideas you are communicating the sub communication is what these words and ideas are say about you as a person like what kind of person says this thing what kind of person does these behaviors so if your behaviors are sub communicating that you need this to work because it usually doesn't what's that going to say to the girl low-value write it this guy's a it's a shortcut to value now it's interesting because you really got to be in that buyer mentality which is like you know what I'm okay with myself it's for some for some not for others I understand that and you're physically attractive to me that's the price of admission okay cool what else we got going on here I'll always tell the girl I'll be like look you know I'm old so I need an energetic match okay I can barely even get my dick hard anymore my prostates the size of a fucking grapefruit okay I got to take fucking like saw palmetto and shit I'm right here bitch you want to see my fucking prostate I'm like look look at my prostate and I like look at my giant swollen prostate you know back in the day people used to stuff their pants like a sock in the front now they got prostate pants and you put it in the bottom by your chode and you can all the ladies can see how how huge and inflamed your prostate is that's the new that's the new shit and I say all this I say all this shit prostate prostate Pants calm that's my new shit so you know I'll say other stuff like oh I just I just fuck two girls in the bathroom right now you think I give a fuck about your little pussy I need an energetic match I need a girl who captures my imagination I need a girl who makes my nostrils flare okay  so you really want to you really want to put it on that now cuz here's the thing what yes it is true that you need to get a handle on what we call the nuts and bolts of game okay that means game mechanics what are game mechanics game mechanics means having a basic awareness of how to stand having an awareness of how to square up with the girl having an awareness of how to communicate in a man to woman dynamic and tonality how to deal with the peer group how to suss out logistics how to lead etc etc etc how to spot windows of opportunity and go through them how to respond when tools etc etc etc etc etc okay those are the mechanics of game and yes it does take time to learn those and it takes time to internalize them to a degree where you can deploy the correct strategies dynamically as different situations arise in field ok that's going to take time however once you get that down really for me because I know my my game mechanics going to be down unless I've had like a protracted absence from the game or like you know some sabbatical or hiatus whatever I'm getting back into it shaking the rust off but most of the time I know that I'm going to be monitoring my mechanics well so for me given that I only have three criteria for what constitutes a successful approach in the field number one did I approach all right and that one's big I mean it sounds kind of facil but it's actually huge because I personally cannot remember rejections I I literally don't remember them okay like it just it's it the the information is not important it does not get written to disk it's like I will if there is a lesson to be gleaned from it the lesson will be internalized or in this case at this point reinforced that that little neural pathway will be reinforced and then the details discarded like it's unimportant I won't remember it but what I do remember is not taking action I will remember that fucking shit like if I see a girl and I'm attracted to her I'm like damn that fucking girl but then I I don't step I I dig around I fucking rationalize why I shouldn't go what am I going to say what am I gonna do oh and then she's fucking gone and guess what I didn't approach now I'm going to remember that because it means I was a bitch right and you don't want to view yourself as a bitch I remember the first time I ever went to Australia which was 2004 or 2005 so that's that's 10 11 years ago and I saw like a girl that I probably consider my 10 you know tall blonde big tits walking down the fucking Darling Harbour I can see it as though it were yesterday I can feel the cool night air on my skin you know and I was like okay here we go here we go nope she fucking fucked off into the crowd never saw her again I still remember that shit it still bothers me you know and how many countless girls have told me to fuck off or I gotta meet my fans and I get a drag man like whatever countless I'm sure but you know what I don't remember any of those I just don't I just don't unless it was like particularly funny like that's the other night I've had this girl I pulled her outside of the bar at the twilight zone you guys know what twilight zone is the end of the night where it's kind of shit-faced so I just go outside the bar and I'm like I do a hand of God I'm like you taste my poem Polaroid who are you my beloved runner through the hole shit's been around kiss her her roommate even come seems like we're leaving she's like no you go on home without me I'm going home with this guy like literally tells the friends my damn that doesn't happen too frequently okay you know what I mean were they like literally verbatim tell the friends fuck off I'm going home with this guy then we go and we start walking and we get to my car and I open the van and she's like wait what the fuck is this I'm like it's my car this is that she's like what the fuck is this for I'm my transportation she's like like just come on in she's like no I getting in this shit like no that's cool just get the front it's like fuck you motherfucker she's like I should have go on my friend what is this shit fuck you and likes and like literally sprint Sprint's across the street jumps in a cab and speeds off into the night and I'm like god damn it but you know again some girls love the van some girls won't even look at it you know I notice a lot of guys especially again newer guys younger guys they're afraid to express themselves sexually because they don't want to come off as creepy okay they don't want to seem creepy okay which is this narrative that's been injected into their heads over the years by you know a variety of social conditioning sources now here's the thing about being creepy you are not a fucking clairvoyant you are not a fucking mind reader you have no idea what the girl finds creepy you have no fucking idea you could say may I have a kiss ma'am and she could think you're the biggest creep on earth or you know you could be talking to this girl at the bar and she looks like she you know she's some kind of girl next door or type you know and then you get her home she's like fists me in the asshole and you're like what just like put it in pussy you're like  you know and she's the biggest fucking creep there is and you have no idea you know can be like some kind of lady in the streets freak in the sheets scenario so you don't know so again my three tag criteria first test number one do I am for a successful approach number one did I even do the approach number two did I communicate as a man to a woman as opposed to a friend to a friend and number three last but not least am I trying to impress her or am i self-amusing so it's again it's approach man to woman's self amusing there's not a single guy on this planet that every girl likes there's not Brad Pitt whatever the fuck there isn't okay so when you understand this as long as you're executing your game mechanics and you're approaching mad women itself amuse you're going to get one of three possible reactions number one fuck off okay and you know what I can respect a good fuck off because it's not wasting my fucking time and of course sometimes you can turn those around okay approach number two or result number two haha but no okay that's where the girl be like haha you're cool but no thank you for whatever reason my boyfriend yada yada yada okay and then number three will be yeah and when you get yeah then it's time to take your passion and make it happen pictures come alive you can dance right through your life with a feeling so look last thing I want to say here is this I'm going to make my own fucking Venn diagram as promised and then we'll bring up mr. D or C  yeah so this okay so here it is okay here's here's my fucking Venn diagram I want you to think of it when you're going out tonight like this okay so in the club  there is a group of girls that would bang you there is also a subsection of girls in that club that you would bang you are trying to find this overlap and that means you are going to have to go through and find that find those girls they're there they exist in that venue you just have to find them so again for us we don't see rejection anymore we simply see lack of chemistry so a big part of the fun of the night for us is actually going through doing our approaches finding those girls that we have chemistry with and then making it happen and I'd encourage you strongly to do the same so thanks for listening we're gonna bring Tyler up and God bless you God  different  I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't speak yes hot girls you just want to get laid are actively trying to do so online over the past three years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that lets me nitpick the hot girls on any dating site completely automate the process and get me dates left and right anywhere these changes can make all the difference in you getting laid from a girl you met online or getting dick it's simple once you know what to do this system has gotten me laid with literally hundreds of women I've been on dating sites and apps and it doesn't waste my fucking time this is the program the ruthlessly efficient repeatable system for the modern day online gangster and it's designed to get you laid period it's over 14 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with infield footage broken down case studies and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you pull her that night I cover everything for bad photos - horrible photos - what you should look like and how to make your picks awesome how to talk to a girl who meets a potentially insane person off the internet let me but fuck you and how to get her to actually like you enough to be excited to go out my god you are fucking hilarious and if she's the ice queen from the lands of frozen well I know how to turn that around too sorry I covered the exact and repeatable pattern it takes to take a girl home nearly 85% of the time she agrees to meet up this is my online masterpiece and if you know me know I over deliver I keep it real with over 50 real-life case studies and hours of infield 8 foot with my live grade from the textbook date to the bitchy girl to the awkward girl to the princess to the friendzone you'll see them all the program has taken over ten years of non-stop refinement and bottom line it just plain works now you have a choice Tori keep using the Internet to beat off to it or use it deaf someone else beat it off for you so decide how fast you want to start getting laid and execute the program  you,p_FFZbOkayA
welcome to yet another edition of the it's cold as shit and I hate everything podcast it is in fact cold as shit I do in fact hate everything and I'll be your host today Jeffie and we're dicking around on some periscope bullshit as usual the talking shit anyone wants to talk shit here's your your wonderful opportunity and now this is it this is your opportunity however as always I reserve the right to ban hammer the shit out of you if you say dumb shit because everyone needs to learn the important lesson in life that many of your parents clearly didn't teach you when you were a youth many of you probably still are youths but they didn't teach you the important lesson that if not everything you say is smart or funny in fact many of the things you say are really dumb and you deserve contempt and ridicule and you know the sooner that everyone learns that I think the better off that you'll be as you go through your day-to-day life you know and I learned that at an early age a very early age  that I'm a piece of shit and nothing matters so the fuck is this fuck me so hard until my pussy Quivers and causes a 7.0 magnitude tsunami now we don't no one wants that we saw what happened with Fukushima these natural disasters can have wide-ranging unattended consequences but you know the least of which could be a nuclear meltdown that causes serious environmental catastrophe and concern for years to come including contamination of the food chain including you know radioactivity I mean the little list goes on and on so no I don't want to make your pussy quiver like a 7.0 magnitude earthquake causing a tsunami can I block people on this this guy just said ìlook hi can I block this guy I fuck you Jeffy I can block this guy too this is the best part this is literally the best part of this there's like blocking the fucking idiots who call me a fucking fag or whatever you know this is the cyberbullying that I heard about on the TV and it's not gonna stand man you know this this has to end this is a serious issue the kids are killing themselves every day and you know I could also kill myself as a result of these horrible comments as a result of these insensitive horrible comments that are saying things like go fuck yourself Jeffy you look high you know why won't someone think about me you know sad won't someone want someone think about my feelings for a change instead of I look high okay you know you will see no said you look Holly yeah you wanna see my fucking you'll see my fucking decorative fucking poinsettias yeah bitch this is holiday holiday cheer motherfuckers holiday fucking cheer so I'm gonna hear any of this oh you're high oh fuck you Jeffy okay you could take your ass to the store with that shit take your ass right to the store because I plan this is holiday this is holiday times this is nondenominational holiday time are you really making money doing that still doing what still pick up that is that a question your are you really asking this am I am I making money motherfucker what am I am I making money oh you you you what not huh oh let's see maybe a little maybe a little maybe maybe a little we have another one who says how many girls did you fuck last week okay look I would never I'm not gonna answer that and there's a reason why you don't answer that it's because big boys don't be telling tales out of school this is a big reason why guys I think don't get laid because they're they can't it's like a kid getting drunk who got I can't hold their liquor right that guys gets laid I don't play those games all right like dude again a woman in general I I think you know it's never wise to indulge in generalizations but I I would think that in general a woman wouldn't want a guy that's gonna be running around talking talking shit like yeah I thought you'd order you know discretion is I believe appreciated and therefore I tend to hold myself to that standard now again am I being a little hyperbolic here obviously you know if I told you that I fucked three girls last week or whatever is that really like violating so but it not but it's more the idea it's like the feeling the attitude like I don't and grad I did a lot of that when I was younger I was coming up learning and and it is kind of like for me to talk shit on that sort of mentality and one could argue it's a bit hypocritical given my past history with that without that kind of stuff I'm shit I mean fuck I've I used to write I wrote old fucking book I wrote a fucking book detailing these things in graphic detail but you know that was for the edification of America and the world and you know it's for the greater good but I say generally yeah you don't want to you don't be doing shit like that now girls do talk about the guys they slept with with their friends but word okay so fuck you Jeff Tom fuck you it doesn't matter it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what they do I'm gonna fuck what they do what they do has no bearing on my fucking behavior will will they do it they do it modders well do it they do it  I have a large group and need to find a restaurant in San Francisco do do you know of anything yeah there go to fucking Yelp I'm not on you opening more because I was of course what do you call it banned from Yelp it must have been around 2007 ish or something 2007 8 I told I told the CEO Jeremy Stoppelman I refer to him as Jeremy Stoppelman and this resulted in my being banned I was also the what he called labeled a a sexual predator because I had slept with I don't know something like nine to thirty I know I slept with like a bunch of people off at Yelp and people always asked me like how the fuck do you sleep of something off of Yelp isn't that like a restaurant reviews site and yes it is but what you do is you simply and this is of course before OkCupid and before you know the various dating apps that we have now that make it so easy to to do that kind of stuff but this was prior to that and I would just any sort of web site that had any sort of like community aspect to it I would leverage that to get laid I would actually just go on there and like using the existing infrastructure of however you would communicate on there whether it would be like a forum or you know even again on Yelp they have these retro reviews and what you would do I would just write these reviews and anytime a girl would be like oh your writing is good you are funny I'd be like oh thank you you appear to be a baby polar bear sliding down a rainbow into a pot of gold what's your telephone number and then you know just take it from there and then yeah I mean I a so whatever you want to call that sexual predator call what you will predation  I'm fuckin predator I'm gonna predate you I'm gonna predate you in the ass worst experience with a non rst instructor no names needed see there's another thing on these you go on these and everyone they don't actually ask you things that would benefit their life they ask these like little bitch gossip questions like what about so-and-so from company X I heard you has have beef can you elaborate on the beef on the on the fucking fake gossip bullshit that has no bearing on my fucking life can I got can I comment on that let me think about that no I cannot comment on that and I will I will not do so so yeah  what are your experiences with alcohol and gaming I've been hitting it hard for six months while drinking but it's not sustainable dude honestly like these question it's like the same fucking eight questions over and over and over the last 14 years this is what this is it it's the same questions over and over for the last 14 fucking years do you drink when you go out what about gossipy question about your relationship with some other dude what about this what about that penis extension  can you name a few books unrelated to pick up yes okay yes this is fine here's what we let's do let's do a couple here so let's see what am I fucking I've been reading recently um let's grab it just grab a couple uh alright this is a great book Mike Tyson Undisputed Truth very very interesting account of the life of one of the strangest lives that's probably ever existed in human history imagine if a street urchin from a Charles Dickens novel was given two hundred million dollars and propelled to international celebrity that this is what would happen and it's vastly I could not put this thing six hundred pages could not put this fucking book down very check that shit out Ulysses by James Joyce classic perennial read of mine that I I read this every want to say every couple years but realistically maybe every five to ten years it's extremely difficult but Klatte one of the classics of English literature by of course James Joyce James motherfucking Joyce confederacy of dunces John Kennedy Toole also a classic book about a large oh fish man like a like a massively huge obese man who is like a larper who goes around like destroying shit in the French Quarter  classic self-help classic by trying to try to say that me hi chick min hi took me years to learn I say that flow psychology of optimal experience a little more literature pinch on gravity's rainbow another hefty one all-time favorite of mine Daniel Goleman social intelligence just digging into this one on the advice of Warren Buffett the intelligent investor not really a bathroom read little too little too involved for the 10 minute at a time bathroom reading style but Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham and another all-time favorite of mine Cormac McCarthy blood meridian this is one of the grossest books I've ever read takes a lot to shock me but I remember reading this at several points like holy shit like there's this one it's like it's like kind of neo west well kind of it is in the Old West and basically they're just being cost like this kid and they're traveling and they're just constantly being like assaulted caught like constantly by nature and the weather like they'll be sitting there like in the dark and all of a sudden like a bat flies down and it starts like chewing on this guy's face for no reason like then shit like that is just constantly happening makes you really realize how much it must have sucked to live back then without facebook live so yeah there's just a couple books that I might suggest to check out if you're into books you know it's very difficult to find time to read this shit these days of course but what are you gonna do what are you gonna do what are you gonna fucking you maybe I need a fucking drink dude maybe that's what's going on here what do you think need a drink okay this is good regardless of pickup regardless of pickup what are you most happy about the way you've lived your life and what if any is your biggest regret so far well  okay I would say this come on and I've actually had to think about this a lot recently just because you know my my father died on October 15th and you know like I said in the in the last video I wasn't like close with him  didn't really care much at all at all when he died I wasn't like oh Lord well maybe I should have gone and you know maybe I should have I mean who knows maybe I fucking should have maybe I should have who fucking knows but you know what I didn't but it made me think again cuz like you know that all the shit had went down with my parents like 25 years ago and I hadn't really contemplated it in a while and so him you know passing away whatever that kind of you know brought a lot of that stuff up because I'm getting a communicating a lot more with my sister again just to deal with the you know the OL estate and everything and so I mean it kind of made me think back to them and all the shit that happened and how our lives are you know what's what's what's the saying the Lord works in mysterious ways it's like you don't fucking know you don't know what's gonna fucking happen now granted when that shit went down when I was 15 it seemed like literally it literally the end of the world like literally the end of the world as I knew it like again just being on fire it felt like being on fire all the time like what's going on the world is you know what has been destroyed this a catastrophe this is your ruined your shit is wrecked and you know what dude honestly my life was pretty fucked for many years for many fucking years and I got to say it I feel extremely fortunate that I got through that shit without ending up in jail without ending up  fucked you know I kind of lucked into this gig that I have now and it's extremely lucrative you know after 15 years of working at it and I don't just think that I didn't say you know this is just fell into my lap and I woke up and now I'm fucking doing well no we had a way to hustle to get this shit you know Oh somebody's dead again yeah that's what does that number 56 this year 56 homicides this year fuck in San Francisco if you loved what character and level would you be and what powers would you have well [Music] I think that's been answered before but I will revisit the question and the answer is shut up quit saving fucking lives I hate this shit between the you've got the lifesavers and then you got these fucking what do you call them Harley faggots look like yeah the classic South Park episode were they brought in a manual lewis to change the definition of faggot in the Webster's dictionary to a Harley enthusiast but anyway so was the saying right if I were a larper my character would be Lord sir be skins d'amore wild a level 12 maids wizard mage specializing in necromancy and my favorite spell would be stream of corruption where the user vomits forth a continuous stream of Filth and and pus and maggots which deals 46 damage for up to four routes how do you pull as a bouncer I wouldn't know that really I mean I get I wouldn't know I mean I would be working I don't know if I would do that you know I just don't know man times are tough times are tough you know I mean normally two I would say like I don't wanna you know shit where I eat so if I was like a bouncer or I was working at a place I probably wouldn't want to you know try to be like getting laid out of the place where I worked but on the other hand it's such a shitty job who fucking cares you know if you get fired whoopty fucking do like who cares it's on the gold my career I've ruined my career as a bouncer I've ruined my career as like a fucking thyroid case in a suit you know I mean so yeah go for it I mean good fucking go for it who cares so I got an idea check this out we got a new idea and here's the idea  TV show myself max are teaming up and we're doing a TV show so here's the TV show it's called fired all caps and each week we get a job at a at a shitty like some shitty like you know entry-level position you know like it's Starbucks or at like Burger King or some shit and then so we hit when we get hired we act like we're you know normal but then over the course of each episode it's revealed that we're actually like crazy or retort incompetent morons and we see who can get fired first and there's you know if there's gonna be like ground rules like you can't just you know tell the customer to go fuck themselves or you know stuff like that there are certain rules but within those parameters you have to see who can get fired the quickest so for example something like initially we're gonna do it like a whole season at one place but now we're kind of thinking that each episode we get a new DIF different shitty job so we can do like kind of different characters in each episode so I'm thinking like the first one it shows up and I'm like incompetent like I'm like an old man who doesn't understand technology and I'm like oh and I'm like constantly like fucking shit up because I don't get technology and then max it's it's slowly revealed that he's like an actual Nazi because he's you know German or whatever so yeah so yeah he's a fucking Nazi and I'm like an incompetent and maybe maybe I'm like also like a sexist or something or or I don't know the fucking just a fucking jerk jerk ass mofo so it's pretty very exciting and we're trying to actually get this produced so hopefully hopefully it comes out I think it'd be just a ball and a hell of a time I mean if it's something that I've always wanted to do was just get some shitty job and get fired how about a Russian hacker I think it's so funny that you know you see this like Clinton shit happening right people are still like Hillary should have won because of the Comey letter and the and the hacky but the Russian hacking so somebody get this straight so she should have won because they they found out about your lives and you're mad that they found out about your lies it's like come on I'm not like some trump guy but get over this shit dude like look at the failings and your fucking blame everyone else you fucked up you done fucked up you don't fucked up you know you put this hideous person as your candidate but on the other hand then you got these Trump motherfuckers and every time they say is like they go every time they're like you're like well Trump is you know doing all these tweets and so on so right but Hillary it's like no no you don't get to say but Hillary anymore that's done Hillary is done gone never coming back never next smote she was smited to the earth and she will never return you can't say but but Hillary believed some other fuckers it'll be like 2019 they're gonna be about Hillary but here he's like do mother know you don't need to say but Hillary no more but I'm getting fucked tax cut so I'm like I'm like literally the only person who will benefit from fucking Trump like I have it's it's sad I hate to say it but I am like the only fucking person like I'm like the straight white guy who makes like good like I'm like the only one who was gonna like to actually benefit from Trump so you know of course as I've said before my super-awesome tax cut isn't gonna make much of a difference if I go outside and it's hotter than the devil's dick due to the climate change or you know we have a fucking war or some shit like old Tapscott nuclear fire I mean I'm engulfed in nuclear flame in fact I welcome the nuclear flame I can't wait I can't fucking wait to be engulfed in nuclear flame  long overdue in my opinion you need a fucking wash this shit we need a cliff someday a real rain will come wash these streets clean it's called nuclear fire it's cause Cory felt my dancing time could be I don't know I'm kind of over the Feldman now that he's married I lost a lot of respect lost a lot of respect for for Cory Feldman once he he got married you know out here he was he was living he was living the dream he's living the dream he had his fucking sex cult you know he had his home his sex his vegan sex cult of the Angels and now he's married to the Mangel which sounds like she has mange you know she's just a poor mange ridden lady who he took in he took under his wing he took him to his feldmansion who the fuck is corey feldman we should have said that dude shoulda said that blocked block blocked for not knowing who Corey Feldman is  why are girls hard how bitches have how bitch have you put kids in how bits how bitch have you put kids in well how bitch how bitch is how bitch have I put kids in how bitch have I put kids in what the fuck is this there's shit yes boy are you doing what we want okay thanks I let him in just shred let him in Oh  sweet puppy sweet puppy wants to enter what do you think should sweet puppy be allowed entry yes or no you guys are gonna vote sweet puppy oh no one wants to eat puppy to come in unfortunately you got to stay outside sweet puppy ok someone wants you to come in alright you can come in mm-hmm that's there's my white person shit look at this white person shit boy like where they kiss their dead fuck out here alright go okay this guy says why are girls hard why your girls hard I'm going to I'm gonna attempt to infer what is meant by that because again most of these people don't know how to form complete sentences or structure they're thought maybe that's why girls are hard because you have an inability to express your thoughts clearly maybe they just don't know mate perhaps they don't know that you want to hook up with them because you're going up and being like why you why you hard lady why you hard  yeah right so again it's probably your communication style or your communication skills that are rendering it difficult why our grammar hard yeah but no seriously why is it hard I mean I think that's fairly self-explanatory why it's hard you know that should be fairly self-explanatory  again that's that's something that you should not have to ask because what okay well let's break it down let's let's break it down to its component the component parts of the question so they're guys like why is it why is girls difficult now by girls being difficult what I'm assuming the guy means is he's asking why is it difficult for me to have sex with girls I am assuming that's what he's asking by saying why girls hard okay why girls hard okay all right I'm gonna get over I'm gonna get over the grammatical part of it but why I'm assuming what he's asking here is why is it difficult for me to hook up with girls and someone else mentioned these comments here that I get because it has to be because what are we talking about having sex so for some dude having said that the RAM of the potential negative ramifications of having sex with somebody is pretty mild you know they're pretty low what maybe you will get a disease maybe mate it's hot it's so highly unlikely highly highly unlikely unless you're like you know my buddy evil Ginny you know personally I've never caught one I thought I did once but it was a simple case of epididymitis repacked practicing Tantra however you know that's maybe that's it you know that's it now what are the potential negative ramifications of having sex with random people for a woman let's all let's take the first one pregnancy pregnancy now she's got a child in her from some fucking idiot some random fucking idiot and and again we're assuming that if it were easy if you could just go up to somebody big hey fuck and they're like okay dad I did just like fuck first of all they would be fucking by the time you were like 20 they would have fucked fifty thousand guys okay again there's a need to be more discerning and then I pregnant with some fucktards child secondly safety issue you know they're inviting like some random person to their home in many cases or going to some like private location with someone they really don't know that well and even like the scrawniest dude can probably kill a woman with his bare hands so it's like three hour walk through old books shoes doesn't want to feel like those sluts like no dude how about she's concerned whether she's gonna be fucking murdered and that's the problem with a lot of guys they just don't understand this you see look when you get good at this shit when again you are then when I say good at this shit I mean you're like you basic it's is easy for me to go out and get laid as it is for a girl maybe easier you know cuz I don't have all these other considerations going on i I just know what to do I know how to go up I know I can commute how to market myself in such a way that if they were so inclined to hook up with me it makes it very easy for them to do so and that's what it is I'm not like come here come here cuz that's what many eyes are doing that you know they're going up like the Cygnus again the girls here the guys here and there's this space in between what a most guys do they just leap the chasm and they're like come on come on come on come on what does that have a tendency to make her do resist whoa this guy's coming hard back up dude you know if that's just like the dynamic you're setting up by doing that now conversely a lot of guys they're like well maybe I'll do you know instead I'll I won't cross that space I'll just be the high-value rock star I will be the James Bond super alpha man expecting her to come with that okay look she's never gonna come across to you almost never unless unless like you're just like her fetish like she's like oh this is my my take my shit oh look at this motherfucker the pan at the beard or the Pan Am oh I like this guy yeah boy right and if you're going out a lot that will happen from time to time you know maybe a couple times a year but like and this happen happens to me you know but certainly not consistently enough that you'd want to form some strategy around it so again what is the correct way or the more the better way to go about this instead of like leaping across I mean come on come on come on instead of staying here just hoping she comes across you sort of put yourself in that middle space and you're like Here I am and you give her the space you don't crowd her ass you give her the space to meet you in the middle and that's why you know a lot of guys they label they'll be able to finagle the girl back to their house you know with like really like florid language and tricks and trickery and they they they got her to their house what happens when they get the house well the girls are fuck and then they get what huh you know the community calls LMR last minute resistance now I don't get that shit either they show up and they're like okay I got a fucking piece the fuck out or they come back and they're just like yep doing it but I doing it because again they've already made that decision before before because here's the thing and the older that a lot of guys get granted when you're younger and you're trying to learn the skillset involved of just the nuts and bolts mechanics of how you go up and talk to talk to a group and how you orchestrate leaving the venue together and things of that nature you know again the nuts and bolts stuff to get that down and to get like the basic conversational gambits that come up and again and again and again and to get that drilled yeah you do need to go out and have a lot of interactions and that's why one big reason why I mean there's many reasons but that's one big reason why pick up get such a bad rap like I said there's many but one is because these guys they're like oh these guys are just approaching tons of girls you know they're just doing these machine gun approaches on random girls and they're not interested in the individual girl it's like yeah they can't be because they're trying to learn it repetition is the mother of skills so it's kind of by necessity they kind of do have to go up to a bunch of people and make a fool of themselves and and you know as long as they're not actually like harming people it really is no harm no foul yeah maybe they're annoyed or something like that but come on dude I get annoyed every time I step out of the fucking house so it's like the suck it up buttercup you know now I grant again I know mini guys can be like drunk overly aggressive like you know threatening violence things of that nature very nasty when rejected and things of that nature but but but what I'm talking about here is once you get that because many people weren't socialized as much when they were younger so they got to make up for lost time by you know doing a ton of approaches well once you get that shit down it's like you will get sick of trying to finagle girls back to your place like finagling girls to meet up with you finagling girls like convincing them until they finally relent and agree to kiss you or fuck you or call you back or do this shit any guy who's worth assault it is good to shit they get to a point where they're like I don't want that we're like I was able to finagle them back and then they resist resist resist and then and at the end of the night they're like well you know I'm bored I'm horny I guess I'll let them fuck me you know what I mean that stops that stops being satisfying very quickly yes you can increase the tally on your score of how many bitches you fucked or whatever but it's like okay what now like great fucking great it's some some other random number that's higher than it was before who fucking cares it's like I don't want that come on come on come on resist and then happen I want to wear like she's like this guy's the shit this guy's hilarious this guy's fucking awesome fuck yeah let's do this you know I'm saying let's do this shit and it took me a long time to wrap my head around how to get that consistently and again not that come on come on come on not oh I'm mr. supercool aloof guy again put yourself in the middle and give her the opportunity to meet you in the middle if she so desires if she doesn't want to well it's not rejection it's a lack of chemistry right and if I have to talk to ten people in a night to find someone who I have that chemistry with so fucking be it you know I can do that no problem because I again I don't mess seeking rejection I'm just saying I know the chef is for some Jeff is not for others so if you're part of that second demographic have a great night bye again why do you guys get so butthurt about this shit about like who are you doing this for yourself or some person you didn't even know existed three minutes ago yeah you walked up to him you didn't even know that this person existed three minutes ago and I you're a buttered cuz they called you a mean name or they are they pretended to be lesbians to make you go away I gotta say that one still does stick in my craw a little bit the fake lesbians because I think I don't know I think it's like disrespectful to the actual LGBTQ community also uh I know you're not lesbians okay I've lived in San Francisco for 23 years you ain't no lesbian you're just a garden-variety bitch or B word that's I've taken now to refraining from cursing in the club and instead of now telling people to go kill yourself motherfucker I will now tell them go jump in a lake ding-dong because it's it's still conveying everything you want to convey that you feel that they should take their own life in this instance by jumping into a large body of water and drowning that's kind of implied and then indicating that you feel that they are unintelligent and this is of course where the dingdong comes in so you can say go jump off a bridge go jump in a lake ding-dong both of these will work very well in order to convey your displeasure with you know their behavior so here we go nuclear fire  Tyler won't talk like this no he won't I don't think he would but Tyler but Tyler doesn't talk like this Tyler Tyler I love Tyler shkreli got bad yeah shkreli got bad you know shkreli Martin shkreli is  interesting an interesting fellow how do I put my finger on this he's like yeah  I think Martin shkreli is one of the very few truly punk-rock figures that we see in the culture today where he just doesn't fucking care I can't wait to hear his new his new mixtape can't wait to see you hear about his new brand of nunchucks that he uses to strike down unruly thoughts while he is out on his thought patrols you know everyone else even soaked these so-called rockstars you know that you see it's all manufactured now we all know this I mean this isn't like I'm not thinking oh I'm giving you some revelatory information that you're just going to blow your mind here I mean we all know it everything's fucking produced everything's manufactured market driven it you know and so researched massage given all the right little imperfections to look like it's raw like it's real when it's not but again we all know this now you know don't want to get to a little yeah look at me on my fucking soapbox about the fake mystery I mean we all fucking know so but the thing is if you look at Martin shkreli this is a guy who was many would say unfairly  crucified in the media you know obviously you know he raised the price of the daraprim whatever I mean if you listen to his arguments about it they seem quite reasonable I would say that obviously there's probably some sort of disingenuous aspects to the reason why he didn't you know but again at the end of the day the guy has a fucking fiduciary responsibility to his shareholders and drug companies do that shit all the time but the reason he got fucking dragged so hard and literally dragged before fucking Congress to make like a theater for political grandstanding was because of his unrepentant attitude to the media you know they came at him and he was like as opposed to be like oh you know go on CNN and cry or whatever he was like no fuck you actually fuck you I'm gonna buy the wu-tang album and not let anyone listen to it and I'm gonna act like a thug and threaten Ghostface Killah and and act like this ridiculous insane person and there's nothing you can do about it why because he has fuck you money he has what is of course colloquially referred to was fuck you money you know I you know his net worth I believe is estimated around there like a hundred million dollars some of you so it's like he doesn't give a shit the thing is again when RSD got put under attack it was threatening the livelihoods of a lot of people of good people who are truly out there trying to help people and stuff and you know we it was like if we didn't take that tack we just be fuckin steamrolled by these powerful forces and you know we had we kind of had to play the game but to think it shre Ali don't have to play the game Scrat Lee's like the fucking man in black on West world he just wants it to be real he wishes it was fucking real so I think again maybe he's I'm not saying that this guy's like some saying he's some great guy but he's fucking punk rock and I think that we could all use a little bit more punk rock in our lives and if young shkreli is you know a harbinger of things to come maybe there's hope for us after all maybe not probably not but maybe anyway so on that note I'm gonna call this a day thanks for watching this shit I'm trying to get 10 billion trying to 10 billion likes so

okay yeah but it's really nice to poor just can't both learn you go out see you later tonight it was a new dude and I wake up outlet doesn't she like she wears some doodoo like she with some doo doo i ha ha yeah yeah I know you mean so but yeah well I mean I think it's fairly self-explanatory the answer to that one I mean what you've got I mean look let's look at the premise behind this okay so you you speak to the girl earlier in the evening it's going well c'est la vie yada yada yada you go off you meander about as well you should in the beginning of the night okay a lot of times at beginning the night I mean everyone has a different set point for their state for the night right so one one thing you know Alex says he has the two hour rule right you guys know what that is the two hour rule okay two hour rule but those of you don't know what it is it's basically this he has the mentality the first two hours don't count and they kind of don't because if you think about it how likely is it that you're going to go out and you're going to you know speak to some girl that fucking 10:15 hey I'm Jeff and people like me for me like oh hey can I suck your dick in a public restroom right how likely is that to happen unlikely but stranger things have happened okay so let's not like put that out of the realm of possibility because it will happen for time to time but as a general rule of thumb of course it's never wise to indulge in generalities but as a general rule of thumb it's probably not gonna happen so you get into that mentality it frees you up the first two hours don't count now if you know Julian he'll do something along a similar vein he calls it sacrificing the lamb have you watched his videos about sacrificing the lamb yes no no so basically what he does is he'll just this is his version of warming up and loosening up he'll just go around and for two hours just berate the holy shit out of like everyone he meets right he'll just be like he'll be like okay okay he'll just go up he'll be like you like where are you from she's like Minnesota you or her literally like pointing to go he'll be like oh my god look look look at that what is that what is that and invariably the girl goes like this right she's like like confusion like me right he's like your hair looks like a bird's nest like it's absurd okay I don't know if you guys how many of you guys have been around the community for I don't know let's say how many guys just got into this like a month ago okay how many Bennett for about a year maybe five years ten years how many guys were doing fucking NLP in 1994 right so so basically if you recall right after the book the game came out and after the book the game came out in the and the vh1 show came out what became the cultural shorthand for pick up two things nags and peacocking yes very very good gold star for you Nexen peacock II so I don't know if you remember this but like you know that comedian Paul Rudd that actor he had some like YouTube short where it was like playing a mystery and I was like enigma and the guy had like on some wax sheet on with his like something and it's like enigma I will teach you the ways and it basically has him going up to like chicks in a store and being like hey your hair looks like shit right like haha the satire of the neg of course flash-forward like seven years later this is what Julianne actually does now right is this is like to the level of fucking kindergarten but anyway so he'll run around doing that for two fucking hours now what Tyler the the solution that Tyler is kind of like came up with a couple years ago is of course the six step process to getting into saying I'm sure you're all familiar with that for those of you who aren't in a nutshell what it consists of is this step one approach every girl you see in the venue and the reason that you're going to do this is as a sort of brute force hack on your Ras or reticular activating system the system in your brain that's actually going to scan for things in the environment that are a Val you or of you know danger and therefore valuable and it will scream shit out it'll screen out unimportant information so when you first walk into the club you may not even see the girls okay you might go like this you see the hot girl what's the first thing that happens ooh want to fuck right what's the second thing that happens / rationalization of why you shouldn't approach oh she's too tall oh she's too short oh I'm not in state yet oh she's too hot I'm not a stay at oh she's too fat she's do this she's too that she's with the she there's a guy with her you know innumerable reasons they just boom almost instantaneously and that's again the Aria is trying to protect you what to try to protect you from potential social rejection potential do bashing your head in with a fucking rock is some holdover from prehistoric times where that could actually happen you tell your brain that's not going to happen this is modern civilization but your brain does not want your promises it wants proof so you have to provide proof and the way that we provide proof oftentimes is the beginning of the night we will simply like approach every girl that you see okay old lady fat chick a dude lady fat chick hybrid okay now why do we have why do we do this because we want to close some old tranny well you know no judgement if that's your thing okay however um you know it's simply as it okay you're getting into what we call a catch and shoot headspace okay a catch and shoot headspace meaning this you see you go you see you go alright when I come down here a lot of times I'll go to the the Lakers games with with Thailand and tell there's a huge basketball fan and he's like you know was probably more arcane knowledge about basketball than he should but you know like I remember we're at the game once last year and he's like you know watch Kobe he's like when Kobe when he catches the ball even if he has a defender on him if he just catches it and shoots without thinking he tends to make those shots more than when he catches it and he he kind of gauges it and has a clear look and as I watch this I'm like oh that's interesting and that's kind of what you're trying to do you're trying to get in a catch and shoot headspace you see you go you see you go you don't think now if you're unable to do that with the fat tranny at the beginning of the night how the fuck are you going to do that a 110 in the morning when you see the nine walk all right so that is why we advocate to approach all second thing is this minimize time between interactions number three don't judge yourself as long as I'm approaching I'm communicating as a man to a woman and I'm amusing myself as opposed to trying to impress them in the hopes that they stay and keep talking to me I consider that a success ten hundred of ten number four find something funny after every interaction okay it's your movie not theirs the movie doesn't end when they leave the movie continues on and you continue to have fun number five short and sweet early burn it to the ground later and then number six a Baraka miss with each interaction so what you're asking about really kind of pertains to number five okay so short and sweet early like what do I mean by that in the beginning of the night since again you know that those interactions probably aren't going to lead to you banging in a public restroom at least not right then and there what you're going to want to do is have short little interactions at the beginning of the night so for example you might just go up and be like oh hey I love your watch right oh hey excuse me do you know the bathroom is or party times high five in fact back in the day like 2002 2003 we had this guy this friend of ours named Craig and what Craig would do this is like he's uh it's kind of like this frat boy player dude who just gets sloshed and fucking partying it up great success but he you know he really do we called shorts set method back in the day and you guys remember what short set set method was well basically it's like you keep the interactions really short and you just do a mass approach so basically he when he'd walk into the venue he would go in he would high-five every chick in the venue right he just go around high five high five high five high five and this would take you know 15 minutes or so whatever and then he would say okay what were the ones that responded the best to that like what was the best reactions to that and then he'd go around and he kind of like do it again do another circuit focusing on those slowly whittling them down until by the end of the night by the Twilight Zone where everyone's shit-faced and the scores are being settled you know about 1:15 on he would then have like two or three that he's now playing it to the hill with okay that now he's trying to fucking dent attend to that so for example if you're doing a short set method and and you're you know you're doing these short and sweet interactions early in the night and you come up you come back and you see the girl is with some other dude well your question is I sit back and wait for him to blow himself out that's the problem right there I mean you got to be proactive all right because the thing is this with that you always got to think about this one thing that Tyler taught me if you're from watching him it's like that dude is always at the caws end of things in the environment always 100% of the time at no point will you see Tyler like passive waiting for something in the environment to change to be more conducive to his goals that you will never ever see that he's never sitting there like twiddling his thumbs like I guess this is happening right now to me right you got to go in you just got a step you got to step to it I mean that's really that's really the the easy answer it's a not easy answer I guess because if it was easy answer you we'd we'd all be doing it but I mean you just got a step to it I mean because the girl here's another thing the girl probably sees you you know Sam the girl probably sees you waiting in the corner I mean look the girls are extremely perceptive about this shit a lot I mean in most case in a lot of cases right I know there's alcohol involved the club a lot of people just fucking oblivious but by the same token you know I've had girls say like dude I you know when a guy comes in the venue and he takes note of me and he does not approach I know that and it's like if he doesn't give you if it takes him a while to come up I just think it's a punk ass right so it's a similar scenario the longer you wait for the guy to blow himself out the worse it's going to be when you actually do go up and guess what even when you do go up you have no like guarantee of it working anyway so you might as well find out early and you have more time to actually if it doesn't work then you still have time left in the night to go and find something that's actually gonna that's actually to be productive okay fantastic next next caller please Amir biggest upset in your life biggest upset in my life umm biggest challenge in my life um wow that's that's difficult probably dealing with the whole thing when I was 15 my dad kidnapped my mother in and her boyfriend and tortured them in a hotel room for three days and then when I came back from vacation at dinner the SWAT team kicked the door and arrested my dad I haven't seen him since next question thanks a lot Amir bringing up those memories god damn it yes it was the best way to do a proceed it's cute it's even if you're like arts or anything on it I'm trying to do with it like a favela well what do you mean give me an example please you're out like this one aspect of your life is you're working on getting there but you know it's just like a thought in your mind that will hinder you okay well I mean look it's it's basically one thing that it's easy easy to overlook is that every instructor in our SD started out from a relatively chode Lee place so to speak meaning that again nobody's cut from a different cloth that's something that we hammer on over and over and again and again you know we all had to to go through that process now when I was first starting out for me to be honest like the real thing that made me persevere through those things even when I was out there getting tooled even when I was out there going to places that were intimidating to me okay like I'd go I go to a club for example not even like a super good club like some club in like San Francisco or something and like I'm waiting in line to get in and it's like just hearing the music like I was like doo doo doo but fuck I can't believe I have to go in here I can't believe I have to do this chore these people they all look so much cooler than me they're dressed better etc etc however I did it anyway do you know why I did it anyway would you care to hazard a guess well because there's no fucking alternative for me okay it's look one thing that I always told bootcamp students and you know this is kind of the defining factor or the deciding variable between whether or not somebody's going to you know dick around at it for a while and then quit versus the guy who's going to persevere no matter the cost and get better is this does he have emotional leverage what is emotional leverage I mean it's a Tony Robbins concept you've likely heard before but basically it's when the potential pain of making a change it has now become outweighed by the very real pain of continuing to do things as you've been doing them okay now for me I mean shit we all got the same motherfucking sob story you know I came up and I was respectful loved I thought players were evil I was the chivalry I'd write a a mix tape and a note and a poem profess the thing in the boombox with John Cusack and all that say anything um and then of course my first girlfriend who I met I didn't get late till I was 19 years old and my first girlfriend was also a virgin we met in the dormitories at San Francisco State University go Gators and I we it was it was like a fairy tale hookup to virgins like awkwardly hooking up and then proceeding to have like sex for eight hours on methamphetamine but it's so beautiful I did a lot of drugs in college okay a lot of drugs um but anyway yeah so one day we decided to go to no we started to take LSD and she wanted to go to she insisted on going to church before and so we went so I went to church and then she had the inevitable freakout called her parents in Texas within two days they had sent emissaries from the church to take her back never saw her again two months later she got out of inpatient re-education camp and I said yo so I'm so glad to hear your voice when are you coming back she's like things are different now Jeff I walk with him like walk him what the fuck you talk it's like Jesus Jeff Jesus I never saw her again you know and then my second girlfriend I dated this chick that was like 10 years older than me and it was just like an abusive nightmare of like mania but um got out of that and I was like fuck this shit like you know what enough enough of this everyone's going to leave you on a long enough time line I mean it's coming from a very bitter place you know what and a lot of guys in RC are coming from that bitter place I don't give a fuck whatever gets you in the door all right we'll take you to a more healthy place hopefully you know we encourage you to do that of course everyone has their own path to to pursue but I mean honestly like for me it was just like ya basta they talked today yes it was no more motherfucker like I don't care what happens I mean cuz look I was in I mean dude I like a lot of people don't understand this but Tyler myself many people in ours see these days I mean I look at this crowd and I see normal-looking people you know for the most part you know everyone looks pretty normal I mean back in the day we first started holy-shit any half the half you'd have feather boas the other half would have like tarot cards and shit like runes rune casting and handwriting analysis and all the dissing on sense you know like very very strange but as the years have progressed I mean it's just like normal guys but what you know understand is I talk shit about those weirdos we were fucking the weirdest of all probably okay we're fucking psychos okay so when I'm going out I'm not just getting girls like me what is that what is it what does a blowout look like let's let's be realistic what does a blow typically look like this what it looks like right or well hey nice to meet you we have to go to the bathroom that's what it looks like not so with me it's like it's like this it's like oh yeah drink in the face like calling someone kick this guy's ass kick this guy's ass Rika's like we're fucking psychos so you know a lot of times I remember back in those days I mean I kind of have a tendency to romanticize them now you know like Oh golly I wish I could go back to those days of 2003 everything everything seems so new and magical I mean it kind of did like you know you're learning all this stuff you're going out you're seeing it actually starts a work quote-unquote and you're like what the fuck like it almost felt like you would attain some sort of like super power it's like you're a wizard Harry you know but and so it is often quite encouraging but then you know by the same token like what I really want to go back and relive them No right because again you're glossing over just the good parts you're not remembering those parts when you meticulously cleaned your room to go out for the pole and then you didn't pull and now you're sitting in this like clean ass fucking room and it's underlining the failure right and you're like you're just kind of like dude what are you doing you know like you're not getting better people are thinking you're a weirdo this and that but guess what what was the alternative continue being a fucking chode no no and a lot of times in those moments it's pure defiance that spirit that's going to spur you on right like when you're on your knees blood in the mouth and you just want to give up but you're like no if I go down I'm going down with my fingers white-knuckle wrapped

Copenhagen Airport and today I want to talk about the power of no obviously you've heard of the power of now by Eckhart Tolle but I want to talk about the power of noah k the power of go fuck yourself it can aid the power of being a dick in judicious application there up so a lot of times people tend to get the impression that I'm kind of this abrasive fellow but I'd say the vast majority of the time when I'm out interacting with people whether it's like a clerk or whether if you know just a random person I encounter in the street or you know for that matter people I met at the club I'm a pretty nice guy and people are actually quite shocked I remember Luke when he first met me he's like oh man I heard all these stories about you but you're actually like the nicest guy and I've met in fuckin RSV right so I tend to like try to be very considerate you know when I'm interacting with table one-on-one you know it's funny today I was on the inner circle groups and I posted some response to somebody asking about nofap and I'm like look honestly I think it's a bunch of bullshit but I've seen how a lot of people struggle with this and how doing this is like had a positive impact on their other actual life so you know what if it helps far be it for me to judge go ahead it's all fun I mean because let's say said no fab can actually I you know jacking off actually does decrease your libido and so for people who have problems with that or for an addiction it could be useful so anyway you know normally isn't like standing through the inner circle I don't really take time to like post a more detailed thing and I'll just be like family because it's below my pay grade to be honest if I spent every hour of my day responding these extremely detailed post to inner circle inner circle official posters it's not a good use of my time right I could be doing other things that would be actually more beneficial so typically I'm like kind of dismissive but this is a more lengthy thing anyway so long story short the guy one guy responded this he said Wow an honest post from Jeff D that's really rare and what what what an honest post from Jeffy it's like I'm always on his motherfuckers who just can't handle the fucking truth and many things but a liar is not one of them the thing is again I don't suffer fools gladly but look we're all fools in one way or another I understand that but let's get him back to the main point the reason that this came up in my mind was this morning I got a call and I was watched to check on my hotel today in Copenhagen and the previous day I had got a late check-out and so I get a call at noon I'm like still in bed I want to get that additional 30 minutes of sleep and I get this call it's a ring ring I pick up the phone but like hello this is front desk like yes like you're supposed to be checking out at noon I'm like oh no actually I got a late check-out yesterday and the guys like it doesn't say this here and I'm like I immediately just bang on like slam into asshole mode and I'm like well in that case your associate lied to my face the other day at the desk because I went down there and I told her in person I wanted a late check-out it was confirmed by her and I immediately adopted this very aggressive tone in like almost a knee-jerk way and the guy was a go I'm sorry I'm not I'm not suggesting that that's just dissing attitude and he's like right away sir right away sir make sure I'll note it on the file and I actually felt kind of bad afterwards because you know I just like blown up on this guy and I think part of it was like I used to work at a hotel and I see it's like the squeaky wheel gets the grease you know if you're like okay well you know I'm not going to make waves or anything like this then you're not going to get the attention Point Blank period and so again after the fact I did feel kind of bad in fact I even had to go down like and talk to the guy that that's when I left to like happen to get a cab he's like okay cabbies like absolutely sir like what room are you in that helps six oh you're that fucking dick but you know what if I look there's certain circumstances when I think most the time be nice like if you've ever watched the film Roadhouse with Patrick Swayze he's like he's for those of you don't know what this is still in from the 80s back where titties were abundant and filled and you know r-rated was the order of the day like extreme violence he rips a man's throat out after the man tells him I used to fuck guys like you in prison so phenomenal feeling we should check it out but the gist of it is if he's the world's best for America's best bouncer and he's hired to clean up this like backwoods Roadhouse right and so he goes in he's the new head of security and they're like very reluctant to listen to this guy because he doesn't look like much he's like you don't look like much as like I thought you'd be taller he's like I get that a lot right so the other guys you don't look like much he's like opinions vary so many great lines by the way that's like an amazing Latta to get a shit test like you're John you're this you're that just like opinions vary which of course of variants on the the ancient all his opinion I think I read this in Marcus Aurelius but in any case he says these people he's like look if they talk shit I want you to be nice he's like I want you to be nice I want you to be nice to the people until it's time to not be nice and so it's very important to understand when it's appropriate to you know be considerate and and and be aware of other people's needs and so forth and but there's also times to know when your personal boundaries are being violated and then it's important that you have the ability to step up and actually put your foot down and say no actually no in a firm tone without losing your shit like again what I said to this guy that I was like it was aggressive but it wasn't out of control right it was like well actually your associate lied to me then if that's the if that's what you're telling me and this is unacceptable right so how do you know when it's time I mean most people I would say they err on the side of two nights because of social conditioning you're raised that now of course as other people who err on the side of too much of a dick and fly off the handle at little things that aren't necessarily even warranted right personally I like a very strong sense of injustice and so when I feel that somebody's violated my standards in that way I am NOT hesitant in any way shape or form to bring that shit to them and actually tell them that I'm displeased to express my displeasure and I think this is one reason why I had to had success and kick up to be honest is because I'm like I had this ability to be assertive of course the flip side of that I've noticed that this is also damaged my relationships with my friends sometimes because I've had to have tendency to fly off the handle a little too much force again to things like that objects that are very minor so a lot of it is just knowing yourself right knowing how your mind works and watching how you react to stressful situation so again it's about finding that sweet spot and so much what we talk about it's like about finding a sweet spot you know if I just say I go out and be fucking a certain bf suck a dick you'll see a lot of guys or you'll be alpha or something like this you see a lot of gets misinterpreted and whereas because previously were meek little guys or you know very respectful reserved people they learn a lot of the stuff then they go out there selectively walking like juggernaut of asshole early and you know I'm the juggernaut of a solar image and there's like flowing through mucking up the relationships bucking up there they're perhaps their status at work you know in school etc like even interactions with like authority figures you know I think it up get pulled over in flower petal make it even worse so again you have to study how you react these things and understand how your mind works of course a big part of understanding how your mind works it is meditation I think that this is one of the things that's very overlooking game you know obviously with RSD we advocate for meditation I don't do it as much as I should but what meditation does it's a self-reflection right of course it's therapy can be good for this as well I mean personally I haven't really had much experience with clinical therapy but you know I'm sure it's great it's very expensive but aside from that just learning how your thought patterns or learning the knee-jerk kind of pain body responses you will have when you feel that you're being disrespected in your field you're being challenged when you feel that you're being somehow underserved in in any situation and so if you are one of those people who tends to do when they'll go into an avoidance strategy when those things happen again by this process of self-reflection you're going to notice and that happens and you can sort of take steps to correct that like okay I'm going into that this is the opportunity where I need to be more assertive and start practicing that conversely if you want those guys it's like a road rage when the fucker just flies off the handle you've got to really learn how to like okay see when that's happening with processes happening inside of you that chemical those chemicals of like anxiety you know cortisol or whatever adrenaline and start flooding you start beating Interzone ready to fucking go wild you're able to say okay shit let's take it from a 10 to a two this is not warranted but I do need to address it so again like I said with so many things in RSV so many things in games all about finding the sweet spot of the technique or you know the principle behind the technique of you so your know just how much to let it on just how much to let it off and again over time I've noticed as I've gotten older I've gotten a lot better at controlling that the hatred that arises the evilness rising as Eminem used to say and arresting that in its tracks and a protein is the more constructive manner so again as with everything in game introspection is key like I believe Todd used to say practice doesn't make perfect perfect practice makes perfect meaning what if you just go out and do the same dumb shit over and over again you're not actually going to get better if you actually want to get better what you got to do is be honest about where you're fucking up again put yourself on the fucking cross and be honest about where you're screwing up and and have a game plan for what you want to work on not just in game I mean you're up your other goals in your life your fitness your finances your your your career and of course your mental and emotional well-being so INRIA in summary don't be a doormat don't be a asshole but respect yourself and stand up when you feel people are violating your boundaries it's been geppi and we'll see you next time on my channel  thank you yes can I ask you what is your motivation for being in the video why do you want to come into the video while I'm doing it yeah but as I'm doing this it's kind of like rude because I'm trying to actually do the video so if I didn't I mean it's cool don't worry about it but in the future like I'm curious why do you want to come in the video what why what is your motivation for coming in the video though I think you should reflect on this and ask yourself why of course everyone wants to amen are you guys on a team [Music] okay so let's do a quickie little breakdown what happened there that would have time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the set set set set 80% of the time this is the problem hey freeze motherfucker ain't good easy he doesn't know why the grill should hook up with him so by the find function she this is the roof of the mouth right here right yes smelling something nice touching shoulders that's the touch down right they're not just being loud but being clear so there's sometimes people will say what they heard you they heard the noise  good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps with chief and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding that would so uncomfortable you look nice clenching it here in order to yeah that's what we don't want ok this we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow they're swollen this is probably what my boss's cords look like and he asked me tricks Eddie's pond what are you fucking talking about oh I'm like literally cringing she was like my voice told was like oh like a bridge but yours is like amazing [Music] yes don't do this don't mix it down shut up the bluff the other B get down you're dumb you're dumb yeah yeah you're dumb your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a to MIT where we're telling stories you want to be more excited or do you need to be more like calm and collected and that will change often dynamically during the interaction itself it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of long-term help for your voice you're going to be able to go out and take your finger like this and push it push it and then and that weird and so weirdest thing when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I truly believe that it's only a matter of time until they like awesome and now para vision I love the occasion my family gave me a huge awareness of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicality behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling and humor sit on a personal little fought there like hell overall in along all my right that you know some little act and that success foxy quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game contest there's like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve we're so so so long

entered submissions for this contest this competition challenge whatever you want to call it frankly I was a little overwhelmed I thought not many people were going to do it because you know to just yell on the street is one thing but to go ahead and like put yourself out there in a creative way like this is a whole nother thing you know a lot of people are pretty shy about that so again I I understand for all you guys who didn't who submitted but didn't win you know it took a lot of balls to put yourself out there like that and that's really the first step in becoming an expressive person and you know being able to expand the party and all that when you go out and not get into that little defensive state and once you're able to tap into that expressive state again this should just become so easy this picking up girls things just become so easy because the girls see that and she's like you know what this is this guy's different than all these defensive little guys that are just going around trying to protect their ego and avoid rejection and they see that you're making a genuine attempts to engage and connect and that's when you start to get that awesome chemistry that's what charisma is so again thanks for everyone who entered Congrats to the winners hope you enjoy resonator and for all you others out there who are curious about resonator and getting healthy powerful vocal projection that attraction lets you get past the hook very consistently check it out and wwr SD resonator calm thanks for watching and I'll see you next time and I would have time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the set-set-set-set 80% of the time this is the problem hey hey what is motherfucker a good evening but the way he said it was it lacked that conviction he's like you're hot it has this wavering totality of the voice this is the Ruza mouth right here not just being loud but being cleared [Music] that's the touchdown right there it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice you're going to be able to go out and protect her remain out here addicted to my family  [Music],qUKf1phsVZs
[Applause]  [Music] [Applause] [Music]  it's a beautiful evening here in South Beach Miami and I ain't got really nothing better to do right now than to take a little stroll here done Espanola Way and reflect on what a crazy journey it's been these past few years you know flying around the world picking up girls you know smashed windshields slashed tires strippers threesomes yada yada yada yada yada and to think that just ten years ago I was simply a mild-mannered chump like the majority of guys out there it's pretty ridiculous think about it how in the span of just a few years I've completely changed my identity from that of a loser with little or no skill at picking up women to that of a loser with a lot of skill at picking up women anyway this this got me to thinking I know alarms going off but it got me to thinking about the concept of identity and how this was crucial to success in the game so to give you an example that I mean let me describe something that I first encountered when I first started instructing at rst live programs after I completed the grueling training course to become a executive coach I began running my own boot camps in San Francisco and it really didn't take long for me to complete become completely comfortable in my new role as a pickup guru if you will and it was then that I started to notice a strange phenomenon I used to back in the day keep records of all my exploits and I had like a little score sheet and everything because in spite of it all I still feel that love is a special and magical thing and I want to remember every girl i hook up with even when they number in the hundreds and hundreds so I was looking at my little score sheet one day and I realized that since I had started doing you know instructing on program I was get starting to only get laid exclusively while on program like I'd go out on my own and on my own time I just drink with my buddies and you know make the occasional half-hearted pickup attempt and maybe get a couple of phone numbers here and there but on the program all of a sudden there's like a fire under my ass I'd be standing in the middle of the club like like some psychopath like I'll make out with what Canadian chicken here just point just point point and shoot right you know I'm running around grabbing girls you know pulling almost every single night or these having the opportunity to pull over every single night I mean it was totally ridiculous and I got to the point where I felt that I couldn't pick up unless I was on boot camp you know it's absurd I know but as I thought about it some more it started to make sense and this is related to the concept of identity what happened was this when I was out of my own time it was just me Jeff you know a regular guy with some pickup game but there was no pressure for me to do anything but just drink and shoot the breeze of my homies on the program however my identity changed to that of jail acts you know pickup guru this monster badass with a sparks shooting out of his ass who's with students around it who took his every word for gospel all right a guy who must pick up chicks and pull off amazing moves now as a side note I would never tell a student to take everything I say to be absolute you know all the instructors despite being very good at what they do are just individual guys we tell you what works for us and you take what you like and you discard what you don't remember that old adage follow those who seek the truth run from those who claim to have found it anyway with that identity of pickup guru firmly in place of course it's inevitable that I would achieve incredible success and when I realize this I put the power of identity to work for me so nowadays even when I'm not on the program I'm able to harness that guru identity when I'm out when I'm out to actually get success with with girls so I told you the story to illustrate exactly how powerful identity can be and how you can take advantage of it to boost your own game so your identity and your behavior they influence one another in some ways this is a case of the old chicken in the egg right which comes first looking back in my own experience when I first started I began thinking to myself as a player before I even had the actual skills in fact my freshman year in the game was largely spent reengineering my identity so what exactly is your identity well your identity consists of the following your beliefs your values your goals etc so ask yourself what do you believe what do you like what do you dislike what will you tolerate from others what do you want out of your life what do you deserve if you can answer these questions immediately and with conviction you have a strong identity however if that identity is one laden with limiting snow- self-limiting beliefs you're bound to fail time and time again so how did I go about transforming my identity from that of a chump and do that of a champ well it certainly wasn't easy and I'll tell you one thing it didn't involve me sitting in front of a mirror doing affirmations not by a long shot in fact the closest I ever came to anything like that was taking a small list of empowering beliefs to the inside of the medicine cabinet in my bathroom and there were five things on it and it was printed with this number one I move through this world without apology number two I make no excuses for my desires as man number three women are abundant I don't need any particular one number four rejection is a good thing I learned something every time and number five perhaps most importantly behave as though these are true even if your emotions mislead you so it's great stuff right whatever the fact of the matter is these little notes simply led me in the right direction you know I could sit there at the medicine cabinet and read those all day and it wouldn't do a goddamn thing I had to get out in the field and actually start practicing making those statements reality so I started going out to the club several times a week with my you know little new persona firmly implanted in my head and of course at first I wasn't very congruent with it but over time I began to take on the characteristics of a real-life bona fide player like I started going through the club's that used to intimidate me I started wearing the clothes of a player I started acting like one and then after I've been doing this for all you know a long time I eventually realized one day I woke up and I'm like wow it's act this is just who I am now so if you begin with the end in mind and you're dedicated you too can transform your identity from a limiting one to a more empowering one in other words fake it till you make it and you start doing and then you will become if you've ever joined a gym or taking a dance class you know when you first walk in you see all the advanced people and it's maybe a little bit intimidating right they move around effortlessly they're doing things that you couldn't do even if your life depended on it but over time your skill improves until you eventually become one of those people and this means expanding your ceiling progressively progressively desensitizing yourself so a typical sequence for a guy getting into this you know it might look like this first off simply learning to hold eye contact okay and then saying hi to random people injecting more flirtatious humor into the conversations being more assertive using more vocal resonance and expression taking up more space physically beginning to interact physically you know starting to have frame control control the conversation getting comfortable with being the center of attention going to cooler place is wearing cooler clothes and you're usually accustomed to cutting off people's threads breaking rapport maybe with people and finally of course pulling the trigger and escalating now the thing is a lot of guys think that player is something that you do and it's incorrect it's actually something that you are fake until you make it and you know once you start to become a player the behaviors will follow naturally as a consequence on another note I think that people can sometimes take this concept of identity to an unhealthy extreme you know like in the example I gave before where I became so wrapped up with the Guru identity that I actually couldn't pick up at a situation outside of that context it you know it is true that to succeed in this area you need a strong identity but I always caution people to be careful that your identity doesn't become completely wrapped up and pick up so I know who you are outside of the game and become fully congruent with that then learn to convey that identity to the girls and that's going to what that's what's going to bring you success so remember a game is your expression of interstate conveyed by the rhythms that you use to direct the energy of the interaction the key phrase here being expression of interstate so with that in mind I you know I'd advise you to start getting involved with interesting things to make your core persona more interesting sitting at home at your parents house without a job playing Warcraft all day is not going to make you an attractive person it's going to make you a fucking nerd so think about stuff maybe you always wanted to do you know that you thought would be cool but you never got around to it maybe it's time to go for it because ultimately if you don't do anything interesting there's no way that you're just gonna magically transform your identity into this like awesome positive thing and become desirable you've got to start doing cool stuff so that's it you know I want you to seriously think about that what I've discussed here today because I truly believe that it's incredibly powerful so thanks for watching and I'll see you next time future and frequent free shipping facial feature and patient and

hey yo it's your fucking boy Jeffy and I'm here today at dawn in Miami to bring you yet another missive of love and today what I want to talk about is fundamentals of game okay everyone gets caught up in the hot new tricks the hot new twists the sexy new tactics when in reality in any endeavor any skill whether it's this fitness bodybuilding what-have-you cooking for that matter I don't fucking care skateboarding the real thing that's gonna get you the freedom the real thing that's gonna get you the success is the fundamentals the building blocks of game the basic building blocks that comprise 80 skill set and so often this gets overlooked for the flashy stuff so at Summit this year I decided as the guy who was leading off the first guy to speak what I wanted to do was remind everyone what are these fundamentals why are they so important and what should they be thinking about when they're actually out there interacting with girls okay so let's crack right into it hope you enjoy it welcome to the wonderful rst world summit how are we feeling this evening afternoon okay yeah great to be back I look forward to this a great deal each year it's an opportunity for me to get out of like the freezing cold San Francisco winter anyway like I said I look forward to this for a number of reasons not just for the the weather concerns but also as kind of like I guess you call it a battery recharge right how many guys knew you're taking an artist II program in general before and how did you feel right like what kind of pro kleh program did you take transformation mastery and right after that when was that few months ago now and immediately after the program I imagine you came out of there would kind of like you're like I'm gonna do this shit you're motivated you hit the ground running and then you know you're totally ready to like dig in and and apply these new tools to your life and so on and so forth and you do but then of course life kind of creeps in you know your work your other obligations the old anchors people talking shit etc etc and like you know other issues maybe you get sick who knows any like basically life starts to happen and can kind of chip away at that resolve chip away at that sense of momentum that you have accumulated so I find that coming here it's good just be around a bunch of depraved sex addicts again and you know like let's just call them like-minded individuals I guess because you know there is that old afterwards of metal maximum you are the average of the five people you hang out with most so being involved rst can kind of be a lifeline to that abundance minded mentality that sort of optimistic mentality that this is not only something that you can learn but it's something that's worthwhile to learn right and so I think being here I can kind of set you up so you're ready to go you know perv out back home and whatnot for the next six months so welcome welcome welcome welcome and you know also another reason I like being here I mean it's the same thing for me too to be around cuz I rarely see a lot of the other instructors were far flung around the globe most of the time and just to be around my peers in that regard and to see what they're getting into and just like pumping me up to step up my game and and innovate and learn as much as I can about like the emerging technologies and emerging thoughts and emerging different ways I can take this stuff like new ways I could take this stuff in order to better disseminate I guess the gospel of RSD if you will now again this bucket like shirt I'm wearing the coat leader I saw it I had to pick it up thanks pretty funny obviously it's a bit tongue-in-cheek but you know what they say about things said in jest so is a hint of truth there's also you know what they say about tongues and cheeks how many guys in here eat ass yeah it's like a big thing now I guess right among the among the younger generation I mean I'm 42 years old so it's a bit of a mystery to me honestly because I remember just like ten years ago if you'd look at a hip-hop culture eating pussy was considered weakness like I don't need bitch pussy da da da da and now you're eating ass like how did it go from that's weakness to now I eat I lick anus like how I mean whatever I guess there's no accounting for taste literally one topic that we push a lot is the idea of what Tony Robbins would call cannot write what is that constant and never-ending improvement right you always want to be learning you always want to be a student that's why for example I you know Nonna's up here a little little while ago he was talking about going to the what is the Grant Cardone conference with a bunch of other kind of marketers and things like that and a lot of people when they saw Julian's video of all these guys at that time like what you're you're going there not as a speaker you're going there you paid to like be there to learn and it was kind of shocking which was weird I think was shocking for us to see those kind of comments because it just seems so natural for us that we would be attending other people's things to enrich our minds and open our perspectives as well right so I mean I'm I've been taking voice lessons for the past about six months very intensively with how many guys near I've seen my program resonator or heard of it yeah it's like that the older woman Susan Nance akr St Nancy as she is now unknown on YouTube and by the way no I did not have sex with Susan okay ever that's the comment Gil hunters calm bro right that's not we're just good friends okay and she's like a mentor to me and it's crazy because I've been singing not an amateur level you know at karaoke I was at you know I'm actually a bit of a karaoke champion but I've been singing for for 15 years I mean I was singing I was doing that karaoke shit seven nights a week before I even got in a pickup and then I found out you know because it combined two of my favorite things which was getting drunk and screaming at strangers but then I found once I got into pickup and very dovetailed quite nicely with the karaoke because I could be in there and there was also posed there that I could you know speak with and and possibly engage in romantic encounters with so it kind of really dove tailed nicely but so well the point being I've been singing for 15 16 years and so it's really interesting to go it's like somebody who's been playing guitar for 15 years who finally goes and takes a professional lesson right it's really interesting to see where the mental maps that I had created for myself were spot on like oh yeah that's what how you're supposed to do it but then there were other things in my awareness that were actually crutches that were that would pinched and like for some drunk idiots in the fucking karaoke bar they think it's awesome but it's not like the correct way to go about it not only like in a healthy way but also to hit the correct tone but I'd like developed all these kind of little tricks to kind of sneak around the correct way and so it was very humbling to have that shit smacked in my face but and you know when I'm like when I'm with her and I'm taking these sessions I'm like you know okay oh and I think fuck it I'm like fuck what fuck but again like again let's go again let's go again and Susan works me like very very fucking hard you know she's like okay let's do this now let's do this now let's do this now let's do this I was like is this too much for you like no what's fucking more more escobar more fucking like right and she's like with you Jeff I tend to go a lot I'm a lot harder on you because you have a you have a large ability to focus right some students they they can't focus and factually told me a story of a student she hatch who was quite good and she wasn't like praising her enough she's like okay next next next and the girls started breaking out crying she's like can't I do anything right she's like no we keep going to new things because you keep getting it right so I think that's something that you know a skill that you want to cultivate is that ability to not take this shit to heart I got a buddy my friend Alan and for Christmas I bought this dude a voice lesson is that insulting right like here you need this go to the fucking voice lesson because I know how much that she's helped me right but he's refused to go so far as I go I'm busy this and that now why do you think this guy hasn't gone to this nice fucking free this tricks like one of the best in town so been doing it for 40 years why won't he go fear of what fear and ego essentially you know and I think you know because he assists me a lot on bootcamp and he's probably like accustomed the t-shirts being this fucking prick that screams a lot like fucking idiot what are you doing right so I'm like no no she's not like me she's like a calm gentle soul like she'll be nice but again if you're willing to open yourself up to where you're fucking up right that's when you're gonna start to see improvement if you're intelligent about the growth the guy that's willing to put himself on the cross so to speak and and be realistic about what he needs to improve and then attack those points systematically right not just kind of like this haphazard way where you're going out throwing shit the wall seeing what sticks and kind of like just letting it to chance right and again the fact that you slept your ass down here to South Beach in order to attend this that suggested me that everyone in this room at least has a modicum of that predilection in them right so congratulations to you now I do want to touch on one topic that I think support and I think it's it's a it's a pretty good topic to start the entire summit week with and really that's the kind of the importance of fundamentals you know and when we're talking about fundamentals what does that mean what does that mean to you when you hear the word fundamentals now what does the word fundamentals mean if you were to let go in the Webster's dictionary the basics that everyone needs to know in order like the very basic building blocks of a skill set or an idea I think a lot of guys especially as you get deeper right they have a tendency to over intellectualize right and loose lose sight of those fundamentals so if you guys had to pinpoint them let's kind of just pinpoint what do you think are the fundamentals of game having fun well okay I mean that's kind of abstract right I'm talking about like concrete steps to take like having fun what does that even mean you know what I mean let's start even before that before you breath fucking mints thank you breath fucking mints basic hygiene ladies and gentlemen and you would be astounded how many times I'm on a you know a boot camp and the client he arrives and it smells as though he's been chewing on assholes for the evening get your hygiene dialed get your clothes dialed get to make sure you're not going out there looking like you know a dad from Walmart or something like that you'd be surprised I see guys coming on these programs like these ill-fitting clothes the clothes just they just need to fit okay and I don't want to belabor this point too much you get it all right what's the second fundamental again we're gonna we're gonna do it like chronologically here okay so you got your you got your clothes on your breath smells smells good now what well no we're some you good you put your clothes are already on you don't wanna take a shower with the clothes on the clothes are already off hon I'll give you a hint map says it all the time go out go out that's crazy that you even have to say that right but like you got to go out now by the way dates counts that's another thing I'm always hammering on guys like if you get if you're accumulating telephone numbers from these people at your media in the field the club the bar the park what have you so many guys they just I've seen this happen again it again the guys just go out go out go out go out and they get all these numbers and they just kind of like let them fall through their fingertips like sands through the hourglass or something so follow up on your numbers you've got to be systematic about it you got to you got to plan your days out right have some days to for the for the day twos have some days to like maintain your so-called rotation the girls you're sitting on with regularity and then actually make sure you're going out a couple days a week too so you want to have a balance right you want it like remember there's a lot of areas of parallel focus in this game and you have to accept you're not gonna be able to like learn them all at once like what are some different areas there's social circle game there's the phone game there's now the Instagram game there now there's the the actual Club game there's day game there's etcetera set a relationship game etc etc etc and you got to understand it's gonna be like a longer undertaking and you just have to accept that right but again the times gonna be fucked the sounds gonna pass regardless so you may as well be moving towards your goals okay so go out get outside of the house and the thing is - I mean it's just like honestly just go out fucking side don't you it doesn't even matter if you're like where you're going just go out of your fucking house just get outside of the front door that should be the standard you're gonna hold yourself to because I think a lot of guys they actually they overthinking right they small chunk to going out process in their mind they're like well I'd have to get up I have to take the shower I have to fuck and put my fucking shoes I'd have to accumulate my items I'd have to you know drive fucking down there find the parking if I can get into the club derp around wait for it to get busy like they're thinking about all these steps it's like the steps should be like go outside like literally and I know you know fucking old mystery said this on Conan like 12 years ago or whatever but it holds very true there's a reason why that do you chose to say that on national television because it's that fundamental okay what next approach approach do not stand there how many guys have done this one you go to that you go to the club and you just stand there in the so-called chode crystal talking to each other about game right I see it all the time like in the inner circle guys like although to be fair the inner struggle in San Francisco those guys are actually taking a lot of action now whatever I see those guys out now but it's abdun flawed you know and I've seen it where it's the full like seven guys like doing where it's clearly like weirdos doing weird shit do you know what I'm saying like everyone else like yeah fun and then there's like these guys like looking around like dude I remember uh on a bootcamp not too long ago I had these two guys and we ended up at the end of the night for some reason at this like karaoke bar because there's like a shit ton of people there on a Saturday and like it people are fucking mammer dude there's like right like full-blown right except everyone except two guys who are like  excuse me so I did an interview as I have well you're not fun you're a weirdo doing some weird shit like they don't know what the fuck they're doing but it's some it's some weird shit because they're not part of like the environment but but when I say approach here's the thing it like a real approach you guys know what constitutes a real approach  yeah dude that's a great mentality he's here he said get in two minutes in other words you're not going to do what we call a half step er like a half step where the girls walking by and you just kind of like do this sort of like limp wristed sort of like brush of the arm and mumble some fucking gibberish like  like this an ineffectual like fly buzzing in their ear essentially and then you'll see this they understand me too when I didn't have some approach this is how I know this shit by the way because everything I'm saying I've done a million times right so like you do and they just kind of go like and it's just like that's it that's it so that's not an approach an approach is where you make a decision internally to engage this person I'm going to speak with this person I'm going to look them in the eye I'm going to speak I'm going to continue speaking from a place where I want to talk to this person not like I just want to get it over with so I can say oh I did my approach if I do five more I can go home and play Skyrim or some shit like right so it's like oh okay I did the work right no you're going to like look him in the eye you're gonna get in front of them and you're gonna you're gonna speak with them and either they're gonna be like no go away and fuck off or they're gonna engage you but you make the actual effort and the decision it's mostly an internal decision you know what I mean it's like you make the internal decision that I'm going to connect with this person or I'm gonna at least make it like a college try it okay so you approach now what  swing through the opener I mean that's kind of the same thing like keep talking until they either hooks or they leave I think we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves here I contact is this sexy eye contact like you come to this shit to learn to have a say I contact I couldn't read that a fucking Dale Carnegie book right but why do why do I feel the need to reiterate that up here then if it's so stupid why do I feel the need to reiterate it because no one does it literally and on the beginning of a bootcamp I'll say it look every girl that you approach I want you standing in front in front do you do you know what front means yes I know what front means then how come you're not doing it because you're standing like 10 degrees off does this ain't the fucking front its anterior they okay it's this like even if I'm like talking to you like right now like if I stand like that like this I'm like hey T it how's it going versus like hey dude how's it going like there's a subtle difference right like I'm up in your shade like it's like business time you're not turned on you're not turned on man I can always tell and you're not you're lying I'm not feeling it from your eye contact cuz that's that's the big thing like they can tip like they can tell what the intent is through the eye contact right but like this dude will fuck like maybe I don't want to yet or ever but like if I get alone with this guy he would fuck like he's not gonna be like oh oh my I'm I'm not certain what to do now right I'll be and I'm gonna get the job done right I'm not gonna leave her with blue balls what's the what's the female version of blue balls I know it exists I know there's a word for I mean I've heard worse where I just can't get stopped I can't remember what it is right now but that's like a legit concern I mean I have female friends and like a lots of my female roommates the back to do was a fucking pussy fucking sucks dude right so the iconic standing in front approaching from the front this is another huge simple thing like I say guys approaching from behind it's just like what the fuck like it's like startling it's like like what the fuck like and then then they'll continue to stand behind like hey so how is it like like she likes it here tonight so how's it going like right and so I'll do this to like the student if I see him doing this like again and again again but why you keep doing this like why do you think guys do this I'm just curious why do you think guys do this I don't even know I don't even know I think it's just obliviousness I mean cuz it I mean I honestly I don't even know but those keep doing it and I'll stand behind their no black you like this you fucking like this they're like no it's creepy Jeff I'm like yeah now imagine it's not like midget II little Jeff staying behind he was like fucking Brock Lesnar breathing down your fucking neck a boy right like that's the equivalent for the girl you know this like man animal thing like breathing down her neck so get in front looking yeah now of course let's use common sense here like it doesn't mean but like if she kind of slightly turns you're like  and you're and you're like you're 100% of the time giving her this very like Charles Manson like stare in the end of the eyes like that's not what we're advocating here but again the majority of the time you should be you know glance around chill out like play it by ear but especially if you're just starting out it should be a rule start off that way start off that way look in the eyes okay what next yeah vocal tonality I mean that's a big one as well talk fucking loud that's a huge one talk fucking loud especially here in these venues you're gonna be going to I how many guys have never really been to the clubs here before so yeah you'll be up you'll be most likely I don't know where you're from but you'll probably be pretty shocked unless maybe you're from like Las Vegas and how loud some of these places really are your protection is recommended and you really got to learn how to project and protect in a healthy way so you're not gonna blow your fucking voice out by day three so that's important as well and then I'd say cult and this is kind of um now we're starting to get a little more abstract so these have all been very fundamental things that take almost no thought to correct right they don't it's not some esoteric idea you're gonna have to wrestle with to internalize or anything like that so I'd stand in front brush your fucking teeth go outside right approach right so so far these have been pretty pretty standard but the next thing we want to do is like developing that ability to just keep fucking talking to keep fucking talking how many I said how many guys have difficulty with that like running out of things to say business right now again the thing that I always say to these guys I'll say like do you have clothes do you have close friends and most say yes some say no I have no friends and I'm like okay well nevermind that example but most people do it's like do you run out of shit to say when you're around you're like close bros like no you probably are just chopping it up and since you aren't concerned about impressing them because essentially you've already been on the guys for years you've heard all their dumb jokes already all their little stories and essentially you're already in so you're not trying to impress them so guess what often times we'll just start riffing and come up with hilarious shit just off the cuff right because remember here's the biggest thing to internalize I guess the biggest thing to internalize is this it's not the content that's making her attracted into the vibe right it's the vibe how does she feel when she's around he was an enhancement of her night is the night more fun or is it like oh this person is like essentially asking me to buoy up his emotional state he's essentially attempting to weasel his way into our fun of the night it's not adding fun to our night it's now something we have to kind of deal with right so again now we're starting getting a bit more esoteric but I'd say that the biggest thing on that is just keep fucking talking right just keep because the bar is low guys the bar is fucking low right it's not honestly for the vibe it's just more about the way you're saying it right are you enthusiastic about the things you're saying are you is there variation in the thing in the things that you're saying like in the terms of like if you see me up here I'll use different like hand gestures I'll use different pauses to kind of give the illusion of spontaneity like I haven't said this shit a million times fucking before you know I'll change the inflection I'll change the pitch I'll change the tone I'll use different like facial expressions etc etc etc so many guys when they go up it's just kind of this flat line conversely though you can be too much of an ass clown right so again I don't want to get too too deep into like the ins and outs that cuz I'm sure over the course of the week we're gonna start to dissect and unpackage all that all that stuff as well what do you think is next besides that like developing that sort of like million-dollar mouth piece where you can just keep talking well stay transfer so I think happens automatically that if there's no choice you don't have a choice your state's got a transfer regardless right but I'd say the next thing is now guys get to that point you can talk to I talk to I talk but then at a certain point the girl is gonna be like okay where's the beef so to speak like what what is this where is he going with this and you see it happen all the time if you lack that ability to transition into oh god I'm making fucking Trump gestures if you acted if you had the ability to transition to grab them by the pussy you're not gonna have the big Lee success okay believe me believe me okay  yeah dude I found myself on constantly doing that you know whatever anyway so if you don't if you're not able to take it romantic right to load the role man this is no longer platonic this is romantic and the thing is you've got a very short time to make that happen in general right and most guys that don't study in these social dynamics what is their approach generally they go for what first they go for comfort first and then they tried they think once they get comfort with the girl rapport with the girl then they can do what now I'll get the attraction now I'll go for escalating because so so how does that manifest typically boring interview style questions so what do you do where do you live do you like it oh that's cool the weather's been rather interesting here has it's not what do you think of local sports team etc I find this just again like where do you live what do you do it the thing is imagine if some random dude came up to you on the street was like hey man how's it going they're like oh hey how are you what's your name where do you live well what's your work what do you do you're like who the fuck are you what why why do you want me to say this shit like where what do you want what do you fucking want you know and the difference is in the club the girl knows what you want it's not a mystery okay they're not like oh this guys have you yet what could he possibly watch he wants to talk to me it was like dude they know what you're there so like they're not you're not fooling them with your little under-the-radar shit and then secondly they're like why should I even tell this stuff to a person I'm not even like interested in and so they're coming out of very ass-backwards and you'll see what happens and the guy never transitions out of that and so when again since they know what you're doing when when you go up with that approach initially just by the fact by virtue of the fact you're approaching if your approach was pretty cool or solid or whatever they'll be oh and then you're like what do you do where do you live it doesn't and you'll see it happens slowly and it'll just kind of be like oh okay okay it's one of those okay well well hey yeah you know it's I gotta go find my friends it's been nice to meet you a little dog cotton yawn then they fuck off you know come up some excuse to leave you know I gotta go find my friends go get a drink go to the bathroom go dance go kill myself it was nice to meet you and then they and then they leave and you'll see this happen again and again and again and again and again and again again so if you watch our you know our infield as you'll probably you know you'll likely see a fair amount of them this week you'll see when we go in we go in for attraction first right so it's BAM open and then into like again we're vibing then I'm like BAM mm I'm peppering in like what we call statements of intent you know I'll start off typically pretty innocent and then start ratcheting it up you know so yeah I go well your appearance is wonderful this evening are you look very well put together are you involved in the fashion industry in some capacity just like no I'm like oh cool well I love your look it's hot anyway like I was saying I just got here and I you know I had Obamacare but now I'm very concerned about the new trend I start ranting immediately like as though I get like a subliminal hit I'm not like putting a spotlight on the statements of intent but they're coming pretty fast at the beginning right I'm like damn you're you're you look similar to an angel and they respect not all respects but many she's like well how am I not like well you exist how am i I'm like well you're surrounded by a shimmering Nimbus of golden holy light but anyway to do that did I write or I'll say like um can I ask you a question were you were you like always hot or were you like a nerd in high school and then became hot we like the fucking ugly duckling and I are the glorious Swan Sarah is that what's going on here haha was kind of a nerd yeah cool well anyway as I was saying again she's like did he just say hot but it's like yeah I did but it's on to the next so that's another thing that not only the ability to keep talking but to lead the conversation to need it because again that's gonna be very important in a number of settings like especially when bullshit comes up like what could be an example of some bullshit that arises the friends yeah okay maybe the friends were really cool we don't know that but you know let's say they start talking about depressing shit you know that's cancer politics religion tragedy you know the tragedy in parkland the shoot you know the some shit like oh yeah that's bad anyway just plow the fuck over right were there like talking shit like what is this creepy fucking van you have what is this van for my transportation anyway like I was saying to just plow it off like again just boom I get tested luck cuz I'm kind of like an unusual individual you know what's the test I get a lot what the fuck is wrong with you here that one fair amount I was like oh well you know I'm not entirely certain but if I had to hazard a guess I'd say it's most likely a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors such as upbringing anyway so I saw the shit the other day it was fucking dope I went to this like what okay boom plowed under right yeah yeah so the ability to like lead that conversation now but but again what we were talking about right there is taking it to what when you know has frequently called the man to woman space not the friend to friend space so again there's essentially five channels of mandawa and communication want to be focusing on number one eye contact right number two proximity you know kind of starting off on that verge of personal space you know kind of like about 18 inches if it's super crowded you can kind of you have carte blanche to kind of get in there a little bit more obviously if it's super loud but you want to be you definitely don't want to be like I had one student who would like literally he'd sound like 10 feet away and open he's like hey hurt the derp 2d and the girl haha it was so unusual he thought was funny they thought it was like a joke but then he just like kept going like that and they're like oh no strange strange and like ruined it so you know get up in there so that's gonna communicate that you're there you know to pursue a romantic encounter you're squared up you're in front of them you're looking in the eye vocal tonality okay again a little slightly breaking rapport a little slightly Dom and a little positive dominant like it's kind of like hey what's up right as opposed to hello may I please speak with you tonight although that could probably work as a funny opener but generally just talk aloud I'd say the most thing the important thing to remember just be loud number four is verbal statements in the tenth and then the last but not least is physical physical escalation and again reeled in the same way like I get I'm starting off with these with these verbals I'm starting out very innocently you know you're a fucking Israel I want to take you to the fucking mall and then it becomes more and more increasingly kind of explicit like damn girl I just want to that's want to get three-dimensional with you it's like three-dimensional what what is this I'm like oh well you know I love this dimension I love this dimension I just want to access that that third dimension girl you know I'm Santa's gonna access that by the third dimension girl the fourth dimension to the fourth dimension - wait what no so what's another one I you know I want to ask a little kiss or pussy I like to suck my own dick it's not really a statement of intent but you know shit what's another one I've been fucking with lately uh I'll be a damn girl you don't even want to know what I'm thinking about doing to you right now and she's like what like I thought it's nasty she's like just say it like I just want to get to know you over a period of several months and I want to meet your peer group and see if I have anything in common with them and maybe engage in those activities together you know maybe some Ultimate Frisbee maybe get into a relationship maybe go meet your parents for christmas make a fuckin trip of it maybe have kids together watch them grow up move out of the house so cheap their hopes dreams and aspirations and then hold hands and our golden years in love and die in love that's one fucking do to you right now girl I'm a nasty motherfucker you better act somebody shit right you know and then I want to finger you with my penis and you know it's you see it starts out it starts out very like Oh your appearances is wonderful would you perhaps in the fashion oh I like your look it's hot right and then it becomes so it's allowing them time to acclimate to the idea with every next like ratcheting up step she's like okay now we're taking it a little more as opposed to just like what stop girl want some dip right so it allows them to acclimate to and that's kind of like the definition of being smooth right it's like smooth it just kind of happens incrementally almost without even noticing you know like if we were to just like crack the lights off here right now you'd be like oh it's dark but if you were like slowly turn it down over a period of like an hour you would barely even notice right so I do the same with the physicality - I started off pretty you know the hands I started to go in and etcetera etcetera etcetera so that's that's a huge thing and again I'm sure a lot of guys in here you've got over the approaching crap you know you can you can go up you can open you can talk but you're like it just fizzles out you just kind of fizzles out and then they say nice to meet you and leave this is how you prevent that you front load the attraction you front load it you make it smooth but your front loaded and then you get like once you kind of cross that sexual hook point where they go from thinking who was this person why the fuck is he speaking to me - okay this guy's cool I'm and now I'm considering hooking up with them not even that they want to but it's like entered into the realm of possibility typically I find that that can happen instantaneously we call that like a lightning strike sometimes you seem you know lock eyes in the club but again that's more rare I say a general rule of thumb be like 10 20 minutes maybe 30 on the outset we are the outlier but you don't want to like be spending much more time than that without getting kind of a definitive vibe of whether or not this is going to be a sexual encounter because you have a limited amount of hours in the evening and if you would spend like an hour talking to this girl before you even try to take it to that level well what happens when you try and she's like well I have the boyfriend now you just wasted a quarter in your night right you just wasted a fucking quarter your night so it's important I'd say again make a commitment to yourself when you're out that you are gonna push it now why don't guys push it why don't guys try to introduce that angle why are they so comfortable in the pocket of the friendly friendly talk yeah like it's going good someone's talking to me if this girl stops talking to me it's back to Ground Zero you know like maybe it took I had to talk to ten girls before I found this one they actually stopped and was actually kind of into me and now it's back to Ground Zero right so Julian always says this you live at fucking Ground Zero that's your home right that's your fucking home no he's not actually there I'm just pointing gesturing in the back as though he were cuz he's always with me spiritually cuz he's father J right father J is always with me I'm also father J because we are all father change father J is an idea that lives within us all especially if your first name begins with J you want to live in that ground zero and and don't think of it as I blew the set think of it as I found out I found out that I discovered that she wouldn't had no intention of hooking up with me ever provided you're doing it smooth okay because and the pendulum is gonna swing you know you got I've seen it happen all the time guys like they do nothing and they happened to me too and then they like go like beast mode or whatever and then they're like frickin girls out because they're coming on too strong so and then you're gonna have to settle in that middle spot but again I find that the guys who it's it's easier to dial back from beast mode than it is to like tip to toe up to the edge and find out oh then find out where the edges like go over the fucking edge and then oh that there it is and then dial it back okay so what do you think is next and look in this in our list of fundamentals so let's see what we had so far breeding breeding breeding ya know somebody set it up here and this is a big one and for guys who get all these done you see this kind of happening chronologically for guys who get all this stuff down it because the great like once you have a basic knowledge of the mechanics of game like the nuts and bolts how do I do an approach how do I generally escalate it in a way that you know if she didn't like it she probably wasn't gonna anyway like I'm not like shooting myself in the foot by doing some dumb shit but once you get the basics down the great equalizer becomes logistics and I've said this many a time and I'll say it many times again I truly believe that a newbie with great logistics is going to get laid or at least pull more than even an advanced guy with terrible logistics and so there's two sides to the logistical coin right there's your logistics and then there's her logistics right which combines into logistics right so let's say we got the the the proverbial newbie who lives directly across the street from the club all this guy has to say he's finds a girl who's kind of into him vaguely he's like hey Mario Kart it's right there you see that door if that's it's right there should I go it's right there yeah okay and that guy will pull almost every fucking night with Mario Kart and weed Mario Kart weed you know whatever some dumb shit like a puppy the kitty like it doesn't even matter if I see the puppy see the kitty see the bird see the fish see the fucking child that lives in a hut in my fucking yard like whatever like like any it doesn't matter right they will go you might not get laid but they will just go now let's take the advanced guy who's like even the girls super into him he's making out he's like okay time to go suck all right let's go it's like yeah now we got to drive an hour and a half to my fucking house she's like uh no because now I got to get into a vehicle with this person it's a whole other layer of complexity like what about like where the fuck am I even gonna be it's an hour wait like fuck that shit right so again get your own shit dialed you know I for one I I own a mobile sex location which is my consensual sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of reproduction van and I'll just Park that shit literally right around the corner because with that you know she the friends don't even have to know they'll they don't even know she left she's kind of disappears for twenty minutes we're back and she's like they're like where'd you go oh yeah we were just hanging out up front blah blah blah anyway and no one's wiser they like give her shit like river oh yeah I got that d girl huh lol and again and she can just go right home after she's not some weird dudes house that she doesn't know I mean you think that like the van would be creepier right but you know you know it kind of all depends on the van I put a video up yesterday about van game what constitutes a good fan game and if there's a lot more than you think I mean I've got my band for seven years and if the score is like now 104 serves and yeah no shit I mean like it's real if this shit is real like we get it done in that van so anyway long story short set your logistics but then then what what's the flip side figure out her logistics once it's on you've got to figure out her logistics and there's two sides to this or not two sides but there's a couple like mindsets with that you want to have with her logistics hey you got to find a bow right how do you find them out what are the questions you want to ask who you here with what else where you live what are you doing after this you know a party party town like this where the like it goes super late you probably want to see tomorrow you probably say after this right Vegas the same thing but yeah if it's like you know like a Tuesday night at the dive bar or something you might want to ask that she's like I got to work at 6:00 in the morning so again all of those things are gonna are gonna play into whether or not this is a good candidate for you to go home with or whether you should look for greener pastures so that's number one the second thing is once you have assessed that it's making a determination as to whether or not these obstacles are able to be circumnavigated at all right and some of the best guys I know at the game who have you know like the lay counts like in high high numbers these are the guys who are kind of like masters that just kind of work in that shit you know like work in the France or or sticking in there long enough just to actually make it happen because that's another thing too you got to have a certain I noticed the best guys that that I've encountered in my travels and my my voyage isn't and so on my adventures is these guys that have this just fucking pit bull like tenacity they will be they it's like Last Man Standing so much of this game really is like Last Man Standing gets the gets the prize right I remember one time we were at the Clift hotel in San Francisco we're on some bootcamp and I student he was talking to scroll on this like couch and they were talking for while she's like laughing she's into him and she had like the girls here he's here but then there's like this fucking creep who's like just sitting on bit like the the arm of the couch and he like occasionally like like interject some weird comment and like from me like watch him like dude this guy's bull like he's guys done like he's fucking the chick hates um he looks like a creep he's like leaning behind her and shit she's fully into the student but he just doesn't leave and then at the end of the night lights come up and they're like you know hustling everyone out and the student quite briefly comes up to me and says okay so what do I do now and I'm like okay here's what you gonna do you're just gonna lean her out you're gonna hey let's go get something to eat and like take Bob her to the diner and then try to go from there cuz you know and just see how it goes and he's like okay okay turn around the girls wid that fucking dude and he's like got her hand and they're walking out the fucking front door and boom into a cab gone and I'm like are you kidding me that fucking guy he didn't even do shit it's like he let the student set it up and he knocked it down right like not like again buying temperature is transferable so how many guys near have had like a long like back-and-forth with some other dude sometimes we win though sometimes you lose those but a lot of times it's just who is who's willing to fucking stay in there longer and not like either blow it up by making an ass for himself or like you know getting into some weird battle with the other guy and like getting butthurt and just like again the guy who's willing to stick in there is oftentimes the guy who gets it so figuring out those logistics and then what's the very last one last fundamental clothes clothes clothes clothes clothes could we just chant this close close close close close no I mean the reason I chant that is because it's you know pussy's for closers only right that's the truth right put that pussy down if you are not a closer you don't say so what does that mean what does it mean to be a closer  Michael Jordan right like basically you know it's just it's just fucking like following the rules even at the endgame and like how do you get better at closing by closing you know what I mean that's how you're gonna get better at it you can feel awkward even in sales you know a lot of guys who were like starting out and sales anyone do sales in here you know can it feel like even you've had it where the customer is like this is great yeah this sounds good awesome okay how do I pay and you're just like oh well because you're afraid to like ask him to finally kind of sign on the dotted line so because it can seem awkward sometimes to here's it here's the thing about that sometimes they won't give like overt indication even that they like you right but there's they've been hanging out with you for a while it just kind of doesn't see him on in fact this happened to me fairly recently I was on some like D and it just seemed like kind of friendly I mean I wasn't like super attractive the girl but like you know he's good enough better enough better than nothing if you're watching this you're better than nothing but you know and it was just friendly it was like maybe she's a cool person just friendly and I didn't I didn't think that like it was on like that I had a couple little moves and it was it works she didn't resist him but it was just kind of like meh I wasn't any like a spark feeling so II went to this other bar and then I hooked I saw my friend there I'm like alright shit let's go to karaoke just like wait what about this hot tub in your house can't we go there like oh okay shit boom the fuck in the hot tub so you know so I was like really because a lot of time and I should have known that again this again stresses the importance of the fucking fundamentals right and honestly I kind of just wanted to go to karaoke instead but still you know when you're 42 you're 400 deep like you know you sometimes just want to go to karaoke instead so you know so so we went straight fucking back and again she didn't really get much indication that it was actually on so a lot of times you'll be surprised some women they just don't give a lot of outward that's just not their communication style you know to be like all oh yeah you know the but they're just gonna standing there and there they're a little more reserved or they kind of have emotionally more kind of a flat effect in general and and the fact that they're actually standing there listening your bullshit and not like leaving because look they're not gonna just stand there and listen your bullshit and let you say all this fucking shit about how they're like a fucking angel you want to get three-dimensional with them if they're not into it they will leave as we all know in here they will leave like my mentality by the way is every girl that I speak to you will eventually become attracted to me right now granted many leave before that has the chance to take place but again my mentality is like again if she if I hang out long enough and I keep blathering my Jeff Allen shoot at her she's gonna she's gonna get down with it or she's gonna leave right so close close close close close okay so let's do a quickie little breakdown on what happened there that was time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the set-set-set-set 80% of the time this is the problem hey fucker  he doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him so why the fuck should she [Music] this is the roof of the mouth right here  yes [Music] smelling something nice touching the shoulders ah that's the touchdown right they're not just being loud but being clear so this right sometimes people will say what what they heard you they heard the noise good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps with cheese and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding [Music] that looks so  that was a nice flinching it here or two yes and that's what we don't want okay that's we don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis oh wow they're swollen this is probably what my bosses look like I'm like literally cringing sit down shut up blah blah the other bit you're dumb you're dumb you're dumb job dumb you're dumb your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a two-minute where we're telling stories do you want to be more excited or do you need to be more like calm and collected and that'll change often dynamically during the interaction itself it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice you're gonna be able to go out in front deck take your finger like this and push it push it and then it's the weirdest thing when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I truly believe this it's only a matter of time until they like  [Music] gave me a huge awareness of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicalities behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling and humor but on a personal note father like hello I write that you know some little act and that's mostly quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game concept that's like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve for so so so long [Music]  you,rF7Xrtci74c

hey what up is Jeff I'm doing the blog for my home here in San Francisco today and what I'm gonna talk about are a couple of little tricks that I've been mulling over lately and know by little tricks I'm not talking about short girls know what I'm talking about are a couple of inner game hints that you can use to get better results in the field instantly and the first of these is what I like to call harnessing the power of if and what I mean by this is using the word if to evoke certain feelings and behaviors in yourself that you might otherwise have difficulty accessing so when you're choosing some bit of behavior in an interaction or you're trying to do something in an interaction leave the desired outcome or the feeling you're trying to evoke alone so what that means is you don't try to be cocky you don't try to be confident or playful or to form an emotional connection with the girl simply for its own sake because in reality in a natural social interaction all of these things that we're talking about are the result of something that has happened but prior to them okay so what you need to do is think as hard as you can about the thing that would typically evoke these feelings and as for the result it will produce itself so in other words the word if acts as the catalyst for producing that result it becomes a stand-in for the something that has gone before so let me give an example of what I'm talking about here one time several years ago I was gaming up a very hot girl what many would call a solid nine and it was going extremely well in fact much better than I could even have anticipated given my current skill level the girl is becoming very attracted in a very short period of time she was getting up in my grill she was getting in my personal space she was all starry-eyed and and frankly I was having a tough time dealing with it because up until this point you know I haven't had a lot of success gaming girls of that caliber quote unquote and so I was a little shook by it so I found myself backing up I was getting like nervous I was starting to ask myself a lame questions like you know is she drunk what the hell is this what's going on here is she a hooker right because honestly I didn't feel like I had enough value to warrant that sort of reaction from a girl of that caliber so quickly and frankly I thought she was cooler than me at that moment I didn't have the level of entitlement resulting from previous reference experiences that would have allowed me to remain icy and cool in that scenario but fortunately I was able to observe all of this happening to me to myself in my body and so what I did was I invoked the power of if I said to myself how would I act like hold up like how would I act if I was cooler than this girl how would I act if I was entitled to this this girl and almost instantaneously my entire demeanor began to change so the tension left my arms and shoulders I stopped backing up ash and got into my space my posture immediately approved you know a little little smirk came out of my lips right the challenging look came into my eyes and within minutes after this we were making out in the club so as you can see if is a very powerful word it arouses an inner and real activity and does this by natural means right your brain says okay you say you ask if and your brain must answer the challenge to action so in moments of doubt when your thoughts and feelings are silent and go cold on you just remember if so another trick a little trick I like to use is something that we call engaging with hyper focus all right so whenever you're talking to a girl you have to have a certain point on which you focus your attention so when you first roll up and so you open the group the point is going to be fairly large as I must encompass the entire group however as you focus in on the girl she becomes your point of attention and so this is why in bootcamp I so heavily stress to the students especially on the first day and the importance of squaring up to the girl getting in front of her okay I always keep saying that getting in front of her like dude and they they don't do it and I just keep drilling that like do you know what front means motherfucker you know I we do several exercises in fact that drill the idea of you know exercises specifically focusing on eye contact throughout the first night to hammer this home until it becomes second nature to the student the most important thing to remember here however is that you do not waver from your point of attention all right your attention was not drift to some point out of the set right so you don't pay attention to codes lingering off to the side like playing play an armchair quarterback and then talking shit about about your pickup okay you don't pay attention to people making little comments okay you don't pay attention to other weird shit going on over here all right you have to engage the girl you're speaking to with hyper focus and ignore all distractions and this means not being concerned with anything outside of that he's having a strong frame and a strong reality I've heard this described as solitude in public alright so say I'm on a date in fact this happened the other night I was uh on a date and we were at a bar and the bar was three-pack so I'm trying to get seats so I'm talking to the girl I see like some people about to pay their bill and leave so I'm like okay I can snag these seats and then sit down so I'm standing for like half an hour right so I'm trying to like game the girl but at the same time I find my attention slipping over and like I'm kind of losing I'm kind of like losing that bubble of love as Tim used to call it with the girl as like my attention is divided between one is scooped these seats and then to get you know to stay on the girl so of course what happened then dudes finally left I swooped out of the states and then BAM right back on okay so if your attention slips you must collect it again and redirect it as soon as possible to the girl however one caveat here that I'd like to that I think is very important and I've spoke spoken to this before is that at the same time you do need to maintain a sense of peripheral awareness okay and you need to be able to read the play of what's going on around you now get that's assuming you direct undue attention to it but if I do see people talking over here and I see it's the friends about to come in and cock block or say there's for example there's a fight about to break out over here it doesn't matter if I'm involved with it or not I mean it's just going to be a negative emotional experience it's going to you know Pring a halt to that cascade of positive emotions that you want to create between you and the girl so you do need to pay attention peripherally and react react to those things as they're happening and know when it's appropriate however at the same time you do need to also be engaged with hyper-focus so it's a delicate balance and you do get the hang of AC there's a certain knack to doing this right and you will get the hang of it with experience so another little thing to remember in the field and I can't stress this enough is the importance of relieving all physical tension so when you're in the field they can be quite a nerve-wracking experience at times especially if you're unfamiliar with it I'm familiar with it that you may start to kind of tense up in the club as a consequence but you have to do your best to eliminate all this tension from your body all right so remember to breathe constantly relax your muscles move to the beat of the music you know one thing we always best you know stressing rather is that when we're in the club we're there to relax that's the temple of relaxation for us we'll be like bopping our foot to the music bopping our head we're getting into the groove of the rhythm of the night the to the beat of the rhythm of the night dance until the morning light but why is it so important well try this little exercise go and lift up a piano and while you're trying to hold it up try to multiply 37 times 9 well you may not have a piano laying around so go find some other large piece of furniture like a couch or your bed or something lift that up off the ground and while you're holding it try to think of a funny story right you get the I'm not you can do that right now if you'd like and then pause the video and come back but you get the idea so this physical tension is is pretty much poison for your game it's evil it interferes with your inner emotional experience and as long as you have this tension you're not even going to be able to think about delicate shadings and nuances of the emotional interplay between yourself and the girl your emotional acuity is going to drop to a level where it becomes impossible to recognize the shifts in emotional energy and to respond dynamically quickly and appropriately to them so you know this physical tension it can be a bit of a hard nut to crack because it's quite tenacious right if you get rid of it in one place it might just spring up at another and you know you might have tight shoulders you get rid of them and then you're like leg starts like twitching or something right you know so it can be very very difficult to get rid of completely especially as a new new person so but what you can do is develop a sort of control all right an observer and so this observer must under all circumstances and at all times see that at no point should there be an extra amount of contraction in your muscles and this process of self observation and removal of unnecessary tension should be cultivated to the point where it becomes a subconscious and mechanical habit and until it does it will be necessary to give thought to this sort of thing and it can detract from your creativity and field as far as the game is concerned but later it'll just become a normal phenomenon all right so finally today I got one more little tidbit for you and it's something I like to call breaking the pickup into units and this is important because a lot of guys will just either roll up and focus on the lay and only the lay right like for example they're like open they think it's like open then lay like I go up I open strong with some cool opener and then the chicks like oh time to stalk dick right so what comes in between that just becomes this sort of muddled like a sort of vague nebulous area of talking so other guys make the opposite mistake and they break it down the pickup into micro units where every little thing that happens in the interaction takes on some ridiculously profound meaning all right like they'll be like oh she her word choice here indicates that my value is slipping you know that kind of stuff like over focusing on minutiae so I mean look don't break up a pickup any more than is necessary right don't use tiny little details to guide you but at the same time there should be some sort of breakdown with distinct waypoints and you have a path sort of outlined by large divisions which have been worked out beforehand you know how to pickup worse and and you know for examples of this of course you could watch the rst program foundations you could check out them for a more modern spin on it would be Brad Branson's program evolutions which is a very clear roadmap roadmap excuse me for how pick-up actually works from start to pulled to getting it on alright the mistake most guys make is they think about the result instead of the action that must prepare it so by avoiding action and any straight at the result you get a force production which can lead to nothing but cheesy and obviously in congruent behavior in your interactions one analogy that we always like to use is let's say that you go over your friend's house and your friends like hey do you want to watch the Dark Knight the Batman movie or you know whatever you want to Batman and you're like ok cool Batman great so he puts it on and you watch it for like you know five minutes and then your friend says you know what let's just skip to the ending right I just want to watch the ending and you're like what the fuck I want to see the whole movie right it feels like none of the ending you like fuck this I want to watch the whole movie so when you're when you're looking towards the end result it's like you're you're trying to just put on the end the end of the movie and the girl wants to see the whole movie so bottom line avoid straining after the result just act with truth fullness and integrity of purpose and with those words I'm going to sign off your so until next time stay I see [Music] confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion and face,rnHL77z5zJM
"and I will be proverbial boy and I will be probable more just to be the proverbial boy who falls a baby you're laughing at your door proverbial bud but there will be a pop proverbial the proverbial devotee I'm part Barbie oh boy pretty yellow polka Vera prepare for proverbial alright so here we go now that we've got a nice coterie of idiots here observing me I'd like to go ahead and I want to do a little bit a little bit of a thank you to my proverbial boys and girls I recently cracked 10,000 followers on insta which for a man who's not cheating and buying fucking fake followers which I'm not doing you know that's a pretty it's a pretty good landmark it's pretty good milestone and you know because you guys you know you aren't jerking off to me so for a woman obviously it's very simple to gain followers because people you know masturbate while looking at them but I sincerely doubt that any of you are masturbating while looking to me but if you are that's cool too um you know feel free I've done it myself I've masturbated while looking at myself and you know it's not something I would do again it was kind of like logistically difficult setting up a weird mirror and all this shit but you know whatever floats your boat but here's another thing I'm on what I'm calling no fun October and no fun October is officially begun we're ten days deep and for no fun October I'm assuming anything that's remotely fun so that means no alcohol that means no Oh eating out well no I can eat out I didn't eat girls out but I can't eat at restaurants all the food is made at home you know we're talking you know a half cup of brown rice and broccoli in chicken breast and shit like that and here's the reason why I was becoming fat as fuck and to be between you and me I'm currently the fattest that I've ever been in my entire life and which is funny even fatter than I was back in the day you know I put up some of these throwback Thursday pictures where I look like this you know chubby fucking cunt however even back then the thing is back then I I'm heavier now that I was back then but I'm carrying more muscle now so it doesn't look as bad like you really can't tell if you just look here you kind of can't tell but you know if you look at this it's just it's like here's fine and then it's like bullet which is what happens when you're fucking 41 year old man I guess I mean I guess that's what happens your metabolism changes and so forth and and you got to run faster to stay in the same place but you know what I'm totally cool with that because it's about emotional leverage you know it's like when the look the thing is and we've said this time and time again when you're a dude who knows game or whatever you get feedback from girls that like it's fine you know cuz you're getting sick you're still getting like success with girls so you're like well I guess I'm fine I guess I I guess it's totally fine but then it gets to the point you know everyone's got their own breaking point everyone's got their own point where they where they arrive at that place of emotional leverage and for me it's like when I you know I can't fit in the clothing doesn't fit properly any longer and which is compounded by the fact that Tyler and I now wear these like jeggings as if you know what jeggings is it's a what do you call it like leggings material like sweatpants material that looks like jeans I'm in fact I'm wearing them right now you can so you have a drawstring and like an elastic waistband so the shit it you'll still be able to fit into the fucking jeggings because they stretch  but so I don't know so anyway over 10 days deep sober October I rhymes what I'm calling a no-fun October cuz we're extending it to foods and things like that but you know it's kind of interesting because like like with anything you've got to be able to slog through the initial pain period where you don't see result your honor I mean like you just have to you know if you know right action you have to slog through that initial pain period where you don't see result and a lot of people aren't able to do that I mean the classic example is what New Year's resolution shows you know you go to the gym in January you're like who the fuck are all these people they're doing all this weird shit like the toe curls toe curls curls in the squat rack you know classic you know but come February the vast majority of those people are gone why because it they don't see result immediately it just fucking hurts it just fucking hurts or they go too hard it's kind of funny because I had a student this past weekend and this is a good-looking guy you know kind of normal it should been intense they'd have been an intense fellow but you know pretty normal as far as students go I guess you know his his hygiene was on point and shade he could talk normal but he kept that here was a thing about this guy he kept at like at the end of the boot camp he to be fair he had gotten a bit intoxicated off booze guitar and we had to take we had to take booze guitar away from him at the park and but anyway so at the end he's like man he's like how long's it gonna take how long is it gonna take he's like I'm a handsome guy I'm like dude it doesn't fucking matter like he's like what should I do how do I get better I'm like just do the shit that we went over on boot the bootcamps an orientation and a push right it's like you were doing this dumb shit here's what you should be doing here's the structure of a cold approach pickup broken down into its simplest component steps methodically here's how to get from each from this stepped into the next step here's what you're doing wrong and and not just what you're doing wrong here's what you should be doing instead here's the solution you know it's not just criticism it's also solution so just do that just go and fucking do that shit for like three months six months and you're going to see result like it's impossible not to provided you know you're intelligent about the growth so again you know look I go I do sober month a couple times a year usually this one is most likely gonna probably have to be about three months because you know I'm trying to get down to like a fighting weight again and again it's not it's not for the girls it's not for any of the shade it's just for like personal aesthetics like I can't I can't bear to fucking look at myself it's funny because like back a couple of years ago I was in the best shape of my life at age 39 and you know I have taken two months off alcohol now for a man when you stop if you stop booze you're drinking now you want to get in shape stop the goddamn booze well if that's the case what how come Tyler so fucking fat he doesn't drink how come Tyler so fucking fat well you know granted Tyler eats quinoa and drinks the kombucha but here's the thing about that you you can't eat all the quinoa right so you know the port it's the portions but but regardless for most guys who are like drinking if you just cut cut booze you're gonna see dramatic improvements like you're gonna lose massive amounts of weight if you can just quit for 30 days straight you know and then if you add on top of that a knowledge of nutrition at workout nutrition and diet nutrition it and you're able to like be obsessively anal about that and again you know for all intents and purposes you know I'm self-employed so I don't have to go to a in office or anything like that so and I actually have the next couple off of traveling for the most part and I des specifically to gear down and do a lot of reading to count I felt my material you know my material is good but like I want to branch out I want more I want to constantly be growing so I'm doing a lot of reading I'm hitting the gym super hard and all that and so um you know I have the ability to like literally micromanage every calorie that's put in my fucking body so what I did this back in 2015 I was kind of kind of chubby and I went bowling like just a fucking ripped ABS hero and like a period of like two months and my girlfriend she was like god dammit it's not fair for a man you know it's because it's not because like we can lose fat really quickly and get really fucking jacked if you just buckle down and you do that it's the same with pick up if you get that emotional leverage whatever it is whether it's your finances pick up your fucking emotional health what whatever the case may be and you're willing to do the fucking work I mean that is just basic physics dude do you know what I mean but with the what's the main point you ask the main point is this it's finding that place of emotional leverage you've got to hit that spot where you're like you know what I don't give a fuck like because what is emotional leverage so we talk I've talked about this almost every free tour at almost every event because it because it is in my opinion the crux of what it takes to get good at this shit you know pick up but it's the crux of what it takes to get good in any endeavor to learn any skill you know but with pick up what is it guys they want to get the girl but they also want to avoid rejection they also want to avoid embarrassment they want to avoid loss of validation they want to in void confrontation they just want to get it over with so they don't push it they don't try to take it to the romantic level right and so they keep the nice guy the little fucking hey I'm a boring little fucking chode this is the same dumb boring shit everyone else fucking says doesn't push it isn't fun isn't enjoying himself and and again doesn't step outside his little box his little prescribed box that he thinks he'll be safe in from the judgement of the group and you know what he doesn't get rejected what does he get again 5 to 10 minutes of polite conversation followed by well it was nice to meet you um I gotta go and meet my fucking friend bye-bye you know and what does it take for a guy to finally flip the switch and be like fuck this shit you know I'm these behaviors that he's telling me to do you know statements of intent squaring up look her in the eyes like give off a vibe kind of try to push it have fun with say some cocky should say some shit that might get you blown the fuck out but you think it's funny don't walk on eggshells trying to impress the girl hoping she's gonna like be like you know this guy's so cool he's so nice and cool let me suck it dick write that that's that's never gonna happen you're just gonna get that nice to meet you nice to meet you nice to meet you over and over again and finally look again you have you you want to avoid the rejection so what do you do you want to avoid these behaviors these tall poppy behaviors that might get you called out that might get you confrontation that might get you embarrassment might might cuz you're speculating right so you get enough of these fucking nice to meet using shit you're like you know what dude this shit isn't working this might not work but this definitely ain't maybe this will get a rejection but this definitely ain't working so you know what I don't give a fuck I just can't live like this anymore I cannot live like this anymore so you know what you try it out you start it you know engaging with those behaviors you start adopting a more masculine dominant polarity whatever you want to call it and lo and fucking behold it actually starts working not all the time but more than this that's for goddamn sure and then so you make you make the change so you know for me again there's no fun October as I'm calling it like the fatness was just too much and so I'm fucking gung-ho what is it day 10 and you know now I'm starting to starting to see the result lo and fucking behold you know I lost an inch and a half off my waist already I lost three pounds in a week right because I'm going like hard fucking core about it and god damn it is it it's a lot of goddamn bland  uh well c'est la vie c'est la vie c'est la vie oh all right what else we got here listen let's go through and let's ask you let's answer a couple of questions question a as well we got a lot I haven't even been looking at these Wow let's see you Jeffy you're so hot okay thank you that's very nice I like that I really like that what happened to toad who was toe what is toad what is toad what is toad it's like a Jeopardy question what do you think about lower-class workers giving you attitude honestly if I was a fucking lower-class worker I probably give you fucking attitude as well I mean honestly that kind of shit doesn't affect me it really is just like math it's like literally it's so below the kind of shit I even notice you know what I mean it's just like whatever dude it's like fine like what am I gonna do get the may I speak with the manager it's like dude speak with a fucking manager like literally my life is ticking away I feel it ticking the fuck away taking the fuck away like my neighborhood here I live in the mission in San Francisco California and you know just up the street from me they raised and they tore down this old building and they're building some more condos and they've been millions condos everywhere and like these streets used to be you know like you know one story buildings one story buildings and I was like boom these tall buildings coming up and you know I read I read in the blogs the local blogs the other day like one of them there was like a picture of a Mission Street like Mission Street in 1919 and there's like a horse fucking stable and like like a dirt road and then like a like oh the brand-new automobiles are out the Model T here's like the Model T store and you're like damn it looked so sparse and shit and it made me think you know like seeing these buildings go up like in a hundred years what's this gonna look like people are just look at pictures of this shit and be like wow it the the the city looked so quaint back then you know I mean it looked so sparse and quaint like a little village and come to think of it you know in the past I've lived in the city for 20 years 23 years now and I remember I just live out by Mission Bay and now there was nothing it was just open fucking space and now they built this whole campus there and all these fucking condos in in the space of 20 years if you think about it think how quickly 10 years passes and you think about like 1919 that was a hundred years ago that's ten of those that means that let's do it 100 years gonna pass this shit's gonna be dramatically different and I'll be fucking dead you know what I mean if you think about it 100 years ago was not that long who knows what the fuck's gonna happen I feel very fortunate that I was born in America in this in the late 70s I think it was kind of the last time you could be born and still have have it be cool because obviously the shit's gonna be destroyed very soon nuclear annihilation or something of that nature just fuckery in general just general fuckery where you know we're all enslaved by corporations and shit and and it you know dead we're all dead Walt Disney's dead Picasso is dead Steve Jobs is dead I'm dead so am I supposed to fucking bitch out subdued at the goddamn Starbucks cuz he didn't get my latte quick enough like come on dude I got bigger fish to fry you know what I mean I'm not a bit I'm not big on legacy and things of that nature partially because I don't have children you know if that changes in the future maybe I'll care a little bit more about legacy and the world I'm gonna leave those kids and things of that nature but it regardless even even though I'm not like super concerned with that I want to make the most of the time I have here right so rather than bitch about petty fucking bullshit it's like when are you gonna when are you gonna make use of the time that you have when are you gonna become the person that you were born to be when are you going to recover that fucking spark the dream that you had when you were a young kid and you thought I'm special I'm gonna do something that changes the world when is this gonna happen when you're on fucking vacation when the kids grow up and move out of the house when you get it when you finally get the big raise at work when when cuz tick tock tick tock death is coming you know and again there's something this is a theme that Tyler talks about quite a bit and harps on and you know it's of course as you get older it becomes more more apparent or they say youth is wasted on the young right but but again point is we're here River very short time so you got to take your fucking passion make it happen pictures come alive you can dance right through your life what a feeling and for those of you who don't know that reference that is from I believe the 1981 film Flashdance the title song what a feeling by Irene Cara if you don't know it it starts off like this first when there's nothing but a slow-growing dream and you fear seem too hard deep inside your mind all alone I have cried silent tears full of pride in a world made of steel metal though and it's like what a feeling of disbelief and pictures come  [Applause]  you should end the video like you should end the video right there I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that completely automates the process to get any dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do this is execute the program version 2.0 the ruthlessly efficient highly repeatable system for the modern day online gangster it's over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of Eden field footage broken-down case study and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you polar that night I covered the exact repeatable pattern takes to take a girl home nearly eighty five percent of the time she agrees to meet up with me this is my online masterpiece at bottom-line did just plain works now you have a choice to make keep using the Internet to beat off or use it to have someone else meet it off for you so decide how fast we wanna start getting laid and execute the program [Music]",rphADGVw8GE
you how would you recommend keeping away from being outcome dependent while still having high entitlement because sometimes the high entitlement I think might make somebody expect the higher outcome this sounds like you've you watched too much fucking videos and literally no I'm not even fucking around dude like okay I have a friend of mine and this guy just sits in his fucking room and watches videos all day he knows more theory he has an encyclopedic knowledge of this shit yet his results are abysmal why is that he's he wants it to be perfect he needs it to be perfect before he can succeed right he needs the theory to line up in his mind then we have like a troglodyte like my friend jimmy going out and getting laid do you think he gives a fuck about being outcome dependent do you think I got gives a fuck about being out of dependent I'll come to penny you wanna hear echo dependent I've seen this guy jump out of a moving vehicle to holler a bitches on the street like a dog like a fucking dog you know literally I think we were driving in the van he jumps out of the van and like it we're going like 20 miles an hour he like hits the ground does a roll you think it's a joke you think there's like some story it's real look don't worry about this shit out come to pet what does it even fucking mean what does it mean well I think it means going on and being okay with Bailey what does outcome dependent mean and how does that manifest negatively and your in your in your practical game what does that even fucking mean what does that mean how does the girl know you're needy what behaviors are you going to exhibit that are going to make her think this guy's outcome dependent I'm fucking off see this is the thing I have guys ashli it like that like I'm at boot camp and the guys like wrapped in theory so I remember one time we were out on Polk Street and it was the end of the night the guy had been talking this girl for a while it seemed to be going quite well however at the end of the night and kind of like the scuffle where the lights came up you know the what's going some other guy grabbed her and walked off down the street with her so I do go get her go get her he's like but but wolf that seem needy Oh oh well perhaps however let's weigh our options here option a you run after her and you try to get back from the dude maybe it works maybe it doesn't option B you stand here and look non meaty what do you think she's gonna do she's gonna be walking down the street so you'll be like oh my god so non-needy you know what I'm sorry dude I gotta go I gotta go back again I think that's I think worrying about looking needy is not necessarily something that you need to focus on because how long you been doing it going on practicing just this year so in any case if you that's something that you'll probably want to look at now how can you how can you tell like later on down the road right what do you what are your sticking points right now what would you consider you like County er like when you're talking to the girl where do you see it kind of going sideways I think when I start trying to heart so the other day okay another thing too if you look I wasn't always like this you know if you were to see me 30 years ago be a very different person I was a kind of person where I had friends a circle of friends that were quite alpha and if I quote unquote and if I would try to like pipe in in conversation they would just talk over me shit like that I had to cultivate that see cuz your identity it's a fluid thing but it's it's a very slow-moving fluid but it is fluid if you keep applying the pressure so again how old are you by the way yeah again so in 10 years 20 years you could be an entirely different character however um the thing is if if you're when you're first starting out it's it's not necessarily going to be as beneficial to monitor that stuff now one thing that I would highly recommend because what you're talking about medias you're talking about being because this he does have a pointer because a lot of times I see new guys or younger guys and when I see them in the club they look and they're going after these girls they look like a little puppy dog who has been like thrown his first bone and they're like scrambling across the tile floor to get at it frantically all right if you look at me like my demeanor what I'm interacting in the set it's kind of like this some kind of alien who does not need to eat sleep breathe or have sex and who finds it kind of gross and sort of funny that she does if that makes sense it's very aloof you know it's very men men and if you look at all the instructors Julianne max even even Tyler to me said although he's a bit more manic than the rest we all have this sort of err studied indifference about us you look at our faces like when you go to the hot seat you see the face yes it's like fun but it's like very kind of like it's like this cocky dick it's kind of like a cocky dick who's kind of like meh me right it's an East I guess it's like a nonchalance right and so again when I see you guys go up and they're like right like doing some kind of vaudeville act right again there was a you remember all good old little Alexander from Australia he what would he always say you are enough so again don't don't really like obsess over that right now but ask yourself like really because we want we want to move away from things to not do and look at things to do right like don't don't try to look at the negatives look at the solutions okay so by the way have you ever um recorded yourself okay so here's the thing guys if you record yourselves and just audio and you can get cheap-ass audio recording devices you will be shocked at how fucking lame you are a lot of the time you will like you I remember when I started recording I would watch it and you just hearing your voice somebody's like oh god or like you'll say something you're like and see that's where you'll see where you're needy right that will give you tangible proof where you're being needy I suppose it's kind of like nebulous idea of it right because you want to like look at again tangible actionable things so you'll hear oh I made this little inflection of the voice there that sounded kind of me or you know maybe I kind of pushed it push the too far there when she was responding to it or I stood a little too closely when I should have been standing about five inches back you'll see little nuance things like that so again you'll see the cringe shit and you'll be like this guy is not me like when I see myself in my mind I don't look like this guy and you'll see you'll also see yourself kicking ass and you'll be like yeah this guy's me so as those like you see these divergent behaviors on the video or you know the audio or whatever you move away from these and you move over to here and then you go out and do some more and then you'll move over a little more and you'll move over a little more until you start to adopt these behaviors naturally and you'll you'll again just kind of live live the game as opposed to doing the game okay yeah  oh um so like when to throw in the towel  this can be this could be a tough one because you know difficult of different personalities some girls will test you fucking hard especially if you're like kind of a very confident guy okay so you know I'll go in sometimes like I remember recently I don't know if is gonna execute the program I won on this date with this girl and as soon as I come in she's fucking giving me shit because I'm such a cocky asshole right so I'm like I'm like hey I did it I was like I think I asked her I was like so where do you live she's like oh I live up in Noe Valley I'm like no what's your address when are you home alone do you have like a gun or an alarm system or are there any bushes outside that I can perhaps conceal myself in with a rubber chicken and a ski mask the rubber chickens from my personal comfort but she's like and she's like why the fuck would you say something like that what the fuck is wrong with you why why would you say that Mike what's wrong with me I'm like not entirely certain however if I had to hazard a guess I'd say it's probably a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors like bringing is that what the fuck she's like why would you do that why would you say that why would you even do something hide in the bushes now something I why I'm like to stalk you and murder you because the thing is like again I could tell that she was like poking at me to see if this like facade that I had was real spoiler alert it is so when I saw that when I saw that I knew I had two options I could either back off and be like oh I'm sorry ma'am I'm I didn't mean to imply that I was a stalker in your home did it what would that probably have done yeah would it like egged her on more it's like when an animal smells fear it was it was like to just draw it like rip him to shreds right so I decided instead I'm just gonna like put my foot on the fucking gas and just break through the barrier and you know near the end of a she drags me into the fucking bathroom and blows me the fucking bathroom like I'm like Jesus Christ I was taken aback look you're asking when how do you know experience dude you're gonna have to fuck it up a lot you're gonna have to do it when you shouldn't have and you're gonna get fucking harsh harsh reactions it's really about cultivating what what they call an emotional acuity right well you'll be able to you'll kind of be able to tell sometimes you're gonna sometimes it'll be hazy though and you're gonna have to like flip the coin or just make a judgment call and sometimes it's gonna be wrong because again that's to me the beauty of the game there's never one right answer to any situation you know there's all kinds of ways to skin a cat and just looking at the different rst instructions you can see we have these wildly disparate personalities you know I got me this kind of like lunatic Julian or like more of an absurdist Julian's the lunatic I'd say Tyler's very like spastic beast mode like he really likes it hey hey grab grab grab you know I like to play it a little more chill I'd say like my burbles I like to go up and I do a self-amusing opener why do I do it self-amusing opener as opposed to like something I think the girl will find fun because again the cardinal rule of pickup is put yourself in the state you want the girl to be in don't try to micromanage their state or micromanage their perception of you you simply put yourself into the state you want them to be in and then generally they're gonna come along or they're gonna fuck off right you're gonna leave or they're gonna get drawn into that  you,sYp6oN67unY
[Applause]  yo yo yo what up it's Jesse I'm here in Scottsdale Arizona out in front of the high five Sunday Funday about to shoot back up to San Francisco but I want to do a quick little bee blog before I did that and the topic that I want to explore today I was talking to my friend the other day if you could go back in time if I could magically or scientifically even convert the van into a time machine van time machine and go back in time to 1996 until my 20 year old self things that I wish I had learned earlier what would I tell them what would I tell him what I tell that little punk-ass 110 pound while wet in Boots with a terrorist haircut in Marilyn Manson face paint covering his own blood from manic behavior what would I tell that kid if you would listen let's find out all right cool so we've now decamped out to Papago Park you can actually see Camelback Mountain out to the left there and going deeper now on the topic of things that I wish I have learned earlier if I go back in time and tell my 20 year old self some drop some fucking science fuck that beautiful bastard up with some truth what would I have told myself if I were to listen it's my cue stubborn to fucking listen but hypothetically what would I tell my younger self now on the topic of relationships I think I wish I had learned earlier back in the day I mean I was a serial monogamist and I would have told myself that no woman or romantic relationship can replace your lost family okay I know you know I had a real difficult time with my family growing up and there's some tragedy and and so on and so forth those have you read the book know about that and I you know I was really lost and I was looking for something to replace it and I thought I could find that lost love in like a romantic relationship now again if I go back in time and give myself some advice it'd be this you know don't be with someone because you need them or don't be with someone because you want to make them happy the real reason to be with somebody is when you love who you are when you're with them all right let me repeat that when you love the person that you are when you're with them all right now I'm kind of the game tip getting into the the game tip and the success with women tip I would've told myself this number one social skills are just that skills you are not naturally shy any more than you are naturally unable to drive a car you just haven't learned the skill yet so you're uncomfortable using that skill and had I realize this earlier I could have started improving my game skills earlier okay another thing there's no such thing as being cool all right stop trying to do things that you think will make other people like you alright do the things that you love and people will like you alright some people are going to look like you right I always say don't try to please everyone because you you try to please everybody you end up pleasing nobody because you become homogenized you become Starbucks right everyone will drink it but no one's wearing the fucking t-shirt okay I want to be the boutique coffee shop that some people swear by I'd have a fucking tattoo of and other people are like oh I just like this place too many hipsters on their MacBook Airs oh right people who dislike you because you're different than them are so caught up in their own insecurities that they'll never understand you anyway okay a big thing that I learned that I wish I'd learned earlier was this not everybody has to like you it's okay if some people don't like you so don't be afraid to make yourself look silly or dumb because people tend to like people who put themselves out there right we actually you know a lot of times students who are kind of stifled in the club will play a game called the clown and dance party we'll do a little exercise and what this is basically people are afraid to have fun in the club because they don't want to look stupid so with clown man dance party what we do is we look stupid on purpose we literally bum rush the dancefloor and do the most ridiculous dance that we can until we actually get out of our heads and we can bring that and we start having actual fun and that we could bring that energy to the interactions with the girls right it's much much better to put yourself out there it's much much better to take risks the more that you do the more that you live and the more that you risk the more interesting you become others alright another thing I want to told myself I am the one who chooses who I like and don't like alright so you shouldn't be wondering if people like you or not okay you should be wondering who you like or not now having said that I'd say you know be genuinely happy to see people when you meet them you know I'm always really happy to see people and I'm genuinely genuinely interested to speak to people especially people that I don't know okay you know and I know from a lot of my internet presence and stuff people kind of get the impression that I'm sort of like this kind of caustic fellow and I'm kind of sort of a dick but you know what when I actually meet people in real life I'm very I'm very welcoming to them typically unless I'm having like a super bad day or something I mean not the other day I was at the gym and some dude came up she was like huh like waving in my face and I'm like hey what's up what's up he's like you're Jeffy aren't you and he's kind of like cringing expecting me to like be a dick I'm like oh my god a dude nice to meet you how you gon like shake his hand he's like oh he's like sorry for kind of creeping on you I'm like dudes totally chill man you haven't seen you at this gym before you just move here or something like we got this awesome conversation and he left pick it you know maybe Jeff he's not that bad you know if I see that guy again you know I'd be cool with that dude so everyone is interesting to me all right even so-called shallow Club idiots you know a lot of times you see on like the forms of people complaining like I can't interact with these people at the club there's just too shallow and dumb for me you know I mean look the way I see it is this everyone is talented and intelligent in their own way and just because you're smart academically and intellectual it doesn't mean that you mean more than others okay and if you show them that you're interested and happy to speak to them well then they're going to show you their best side  another little thing that I try to tell myself that I wish I learned long ago was the more attention that you pay to others the less time you're going to have to play games with your own brain okay like in your head thinking are people liking you did I say the right thing am i embarrassing myself what should I say what if I do something awkward forget about yourself wonder about other people how do they feel are they ancient how can you make them feel better okay everybody wants friends and everyone wants to be loved just as much as you do everyone's going through their own problems okay other people are just as self-conscious anxious and worried as you are and everyone else has a voice inside of them too so you know get to know them ask them what do they think how do they feel what do they like make people laugh the second you leave your own head and you start thinking about other people you're going to lose anxiety you're going to become more connected more likable and sooner oftentimes you'll become part of the group that everyone wants to spend time with okay so I want to ask myself to stop crawling in my own head and concentrate on other people instead another thing popularity is not a give it it's a choice it takes work to maintain your relationships you can't just sit around in your ass at home and expect to be invited places you know or to keep up with old friends even for that matter you need to actively create hangout opportunities and keep in contact with people all right and you know kind of the biggest thing I'd probably tell my younger self would be this you know cuz back in the day I was really filled with a lot of rage and a lot of fucking anger about what happened like what happened to me what happened my family with these you know these people did to me and initially I think rage it was I was so fucking pissed man like it felt like I was on fire all the time and that's like a big reason why I wrote the book you know get later at trying 9-ball what have you is because I wanted other people who were going through a similar thing to see you can get through this right even though you're feeling totally insane you know like I said I felt like being on fire all the time you couldn't put it out it was omnipresent right and I felt this massive rage right but the thing is I persevered through but an odd side effect was that eventually I kind of started to think it was helping me like that was the reason I was able to persevere and furthermore it became like I thought it was kind of a part of my character now right and I was holding out of him like you need this you need this to protect you to protect yourself from other people that are trying to fuck with you right so you know if I go back in time and sit down with that kid I'd be like look dude you know that you're this rage your anger your righteous indignation these things are all useful in certain circumstances but they're certainly not as useful or integral to your personality as you think anger lies to you by making you feel strong but it actually makes you weak okay I mean yes there is the concept of the fury you know something you're out in the club and and you're like just fucking around you're fucking up and you just get mad you're like you're god damn it enough again but really that's kind of more you getting angry at yourself and and because you're not living up to certain standards or what-have-you and that could be perfect for you know getting you off your ass and just saying you know you're busted a ton tell us and making it happen right but anger and other people it's totally fucking worthless man I mean the thing is nobody gives a shit about your anger and furthermore they will actually avoid you and that's just going to make whatever's pissing you off more difficult to resolve you know I would have said myself look Jeff Jeff people don't like you because you're an angry person people like you because you're carrying your funny you know don't unload on your friends when they disappoint you they're not going to abandon you right don't unload on strangers either because you know they have no idea the minefield of of issues they've stepped into when they violate your personal boundaries you know there's old saying be nice to people you meet on the way up because you'll likely run into them again on the way down I'd say Jeff young Jeff you got to learn how to manage this because it will be one of the biggest recurring issues of your life all right and how were some ways that I cope with it you know I talk about it all the time in the blog meditation I would learn how to meditate a lot earlier I'm like really stuck without again just ten minutes a day hitting the gym a lot earlier I mean Jesus Christ I started working out when I was when I was thirty was serious I started working out seriously when I was thirty years old but you know if I learned to the squat bench overhead press and motherfucking deadlift a lot younger you know before my decrepit body began again gain week I probably a lot more jack that I went today and you know it's just health in general and nutrition I would learn about nutrition as well earlier and then of course the last thing I probably would've told myself would be there's gonna be a company called Google you want to buy stock in that shit so anyway ah this has been Jeffy I got to shoot to the airport right now I'm probably gonna be late for my flight if I don't get the fuck out of here literally right now so I'm out of here and I'll see you next time confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion and frequently checking patient and patient and patient and face,sc_WhhecuGI
what up Jeff I'm coming out today from ki hai Maui in the state of Hawaii I'm here actually attending my friend Nick aka Poppa attending his wedding and about to shoot up to that in a couple minutes here but before I did that I wanted to shoot a quick video blog discussing today's topic which is actually how success in some instances can be counterproductive to your overall development now I was reading a book that my friend Tyler Owen gave to me recently called Hannibal in me and this is a book where he authored spores you know the historic march of Hannibal to Rome and blah blah blah blah any discusses among other things this very topic and one in one chapter he discusses the author Amy Tan who famously wrote The Joy Luck Club and how that author discussed I have a success of that book actually kind of fucked her up in the sense that it paralyzed her and this is something that I can I can relate to myself having written you know my first book and I'm kind of like trying to trying to get together and then muster up the nerve to write the second book but uh you know I I find myself paralyzed we need the same things I mean you can mentioned with regard to her own her own first success and that was like you know she's she's trying to write the second book just like well you know is this as good as the last one is it gonna have the same elements that people like I need to write something different so I can show I have range but if I do that will people like it so that got me thinking about this idea of success as being stifling influence and so I looked into a bit more and it's interesting because one aspect of success you'll get these will get people praising you okay and as instructors with RSD this is something that we've had to deal with in the past that's actually ended up stifling our game in the short term for example like when I first came up in the game I wasn't I wasn't interested in like being cool or being like well respected by my friends I didn't want my friends to think I was cool or any other shit basically my only motivation was I was like this horny weird little dude and I just wanted to get laid as much as possible okay and so I had success learning learning the game because that was my only motivation however as I got deeper in the game and we formed our SD and I started getting more you know notoriety popularity what-have-you it was started to creep in how did Ito start to create but a lot of times you get guys like talking about stuff like well if I go to the club I'm scared I don't want people seeing me fail I want people see me they'll in the club and making fun of me well let's face it is that actually realistic no because ninety percent of the people in the club are too self-conscious about their old shit to be paying attention to yours okay they could think I give a fuck if they're are noticing anything it's like registering is a blip on the radar with a rare exception if you have like some hyper ass clown and like a peacock suit running around getting blown out left and right through poor social calibration or something of that nature but again the average person is not going to notice jack shit however once it became famous like my d-list celebrity Fame not even d-list fuckin Wireless celebrity Fame you now have people say like I can see it literally I can see it in the club alright people don't like there's Jeffy there's Jeffy oh shit and then like so I'm like what if I suck what if I fuck up in front of these people they're gonna write about it on the Internet that was something I struggle with for a long time now and now it is I you know I've kind of come to I've kind of come out the other side of that where now I you know I actually take it as like an amusing challenge I could give a fuck at this point because there's been so much crap said about me on the Internet again my favorite youtube comment of all unlike on one of my youtube videos was I hate this motherfucker he looks like a fucking bird right which I thought was incredibly amusing  but then you know you have also guys coming up you saying dude you changed my life this and that but really you know I'm reminded of the the Riddler Kipling poem if and and the famous line if you can you can meet triumphant disaster and treat those two Impostors both the same okay they're both imposters because if you take the crit you take the praise seriously you have to take the criticism seriously as well right so again my gauge for my own self-worth is how much I'm living up to my own values right how much of my I'm I'm all my purpose and engaging by the way let me take I can tell you kind of like a funny story about about one of those instances I mean I see it all the time like us like the other week I was out at the club and I'm talking to this girl and this pretty tall girl and we're standing at the bar and I see you know a couple layer guys off to the side and the whisper and piss brand and I see like a new leg I haven't seen before and they are like pointing the outside they're like oh that's that's Jeffy and you see the guy kind of like move right and he I can see a half and I can see him like he's decides to try to step up right to steal the girl from Jeffy so he comes over and he like opens some like I don't know situational combat like oh look at the can and the bottle like on the on the fucking bar or something like that right so he you know she turns and she starts speaking to him and like like trying to engage him I grab the girl's face liked her and literally grabbed her face and I turned inside I say I say I don't even look at the guy I do not speak to this man and she's like excuse me I go do not speak to this man it's like you don't tell me a motherfucking what you do like she gets kind of like pissed and we had to start having it's like faux little tena scuffle in the club that's you know like right right there the bar next you know bow grabbers make out the fucking dude is a nonentity he's done and I didn't again I never acknowledged him he looked at him but I did see out of the corner of my eye he was kind of like okay Jeffy really is that much of a dick in real life and you can kind of see that he was kind of kind of happy that you know his is what he imagined would be actually it was real so I was kind of cool it's like I'm fulfilling dreams but but anyway back to the side this idea of like successful for a potentially stifling thing a long term it's interesting because if you think about it you know your life is pretty long and you're gonna have these like cyclically ups and downs and I've seen it you know I've seen it's very easy to allow a form of success to get you locked into a mode where you know you're you also gonna be he'll survive me I've seen this happen to some of my friends as they get older I've in that same book Hannibal on me talks about how Albert Einstein in fact was kind of plagued by this in 1905 he publishes the papers that made him famous and revolutionize the world of physics however later wouldn't like the quantum boys came out you know Niels Bohr and they started explored these ideas further and really get down to quantum you know quantum mechanics and your Heisenberg and uncertainty principles and stuff like that Einstein could not he couldn't deal with it he couldn't accept it even though the evidence was like right there from you know like arguments with these guys and he simply refused to accept that these ideas could be could be valid and you know the AP famously said God does not play dice but interestingly enough you know Einstein in his youth was like this kind of iconoclastic figure who didn't do well in school hated have had problems with authority and he had a quote later in life where he reflected upon this whole phenomena where he had kind of become closed off to new ideas and and the quote I believe was to punish my contempt for authority success has made me in authority myself and you know it's interesting because I can almost feel that way sometimes it's it it's a stark reminder to me personally that even at this advanced a stage of game where I can basically you know get laid effortlessly it will it I'm always wanted to like channel myself not closing myself off to new ideas like the young you know the young guns that come up in our SD and and elsewhere you know I've always you know reminding myself to stay open to like other ideas that might even seem counterintuitive to to my you know established principle is that I have no pain statement he's ten years sussing out with me and my peer group so always remaining of open right open to new ideas I'm open to the idea that it's not over okay until you're dead and the second you stop growing as a second you've started fucking dying another interesting example would be that Winston Churchill you know I and I didn't know what I didn't know this you know Winston Churchill is famous the famous British prime minister who you know led the country in in time of war to stand up to Hitler and so on and so forth and that's what we all know him as but what I didn't know is that you know the prior to that in like nineteen twenty and before he added a very stellar career in British politics and then in the early twenties he was cast aside right his enemy is discredited him he was flushed out of Parliament like he has flushed out of the government and everyone thought his career was over and he was up he was 55 at that time and he's been the next 10 years when the pontiff in the wilderness years basically this pariah is outcast he was a loser of failure but then when the time of crisis came he came back and Tammuz greatest achievement ever at age 65 so again that's fine to me to always look at that big picture I mean even think about it you want to talk about being the motherfucking boss look the average age of a president on the United States is 55 you don't get to be the fucking boss the fucking president until you're in your 50s you know I'm 36 gonna be 37 next month and you know that reminds me you know for use a lot of people that view RC nation they're very young guys a lot of people to watch our stuff you know it's 18 to 35 more skewed towards the 18 I would I would guess you know and so they think wow shit you know 30 that's super old but really you got your whole life ahead of you earlier you get into this the better you know with straight training I idea that I like adopted more recently is like I don't want to be strong next week I want to be strong when I'm 60 so that always kind of like looking at that big picture of me I don't want to belabor the point too much here it's pretty simple concept I always thinking of the big picture and you know what Tony Robbins calls can i that that constant and never-ending improvement bearing that in mind looking at that big patience striving to be the best you can be every single day and challenging stuff mentally challenges have physically challenged yourself emotionally a very powerful message and I think one it's relevant to us all so anyway I'm gonna have to next wedding right now I'm gonna suit up got this sick white linen suit and until next time Chevy for Maui,snWr2U_OLDo
when I put up its your proverbial boy Jeffy I'm here today on a rainy San Francisco afternoon Taco Tuesday as usual and what I'm about to do is hop on Instagram live and answer some of your questions bringing you the real unvarnished truth with regard to social interaction as always like I said I've been doing this stuff for 16 years this January 16 years in the game 16 years teaching this professionally so I've seen every conceivable situation come up countless times this is again the real talk it's not of this hi I'm like a little dude sitting here in a studio that's making stuff up with like quaff care this is the real deal Holyfield okay so if you like that kind of stuff be sure to LIKE and subscribe right down below hit the bell so you get notifications and with that let's jump right into it Alley London 82 says I kissed a fat girl in a bar just because she was easier than the hot blonde girls should I be ashamed yes you should be ashamed and but not for the reasons you might think the reason that you should be ashamed is because you were operating under the assumption that the fat girl would be easier to kiss than the hot blonde girl okay so this is something that I'm constantly railing against no pun intended and it's this idea of speculation speculation is inadmissible in this game so what are some examples of speculation that will cause a problem for you when you're out classic example you see a woman there and she's got a couple guys with her what's the immediate assumption it's the boyfriend well it could be any number of things it could be her co-worker it could be her cousin from out of town it could be her roommate it could be her random individual that's just standing near them and of course many people they default to this boyfriend thing and let's examine the the deeper mechanism at play here like what why is this the default assumption for so many people well because as rst is always talking about most people are in a very reactive state where they have what we call a muddied intent now what does that mean to have a muddy intent well let's look at the opposite what's a what's a clear intent classic thing would be again congruence in your thoughts words in action so those are three separate things the things you're thinking things are saying and the actions that you're taking so many people learning pick up they'll go out and their their initial intention they have two intentions that are at cross-purposes so intention number one is an expansive intention where they want to go out they want to meet people they want to socially interact they want to talk to the woman they want the woman to stop and talk to them they want her to like what they're throwing down they want her to reciprocate when they try to kiss her they want to get her phone number they want to go on a date with her they want to engage in you know intercourse with her that's intention number one but then there's a cross purpose intention is the intention to protect to protect yourself from embarrassment to protect yourself from a loss of validation for protect yourself from possible confrontation to just get it over with and due to the undue influence of social pressure and social conditioning and as I've always said there are many many I'd say most of social conditioning is good what are some examples of social conditioning that's good don't kill people don't take your dick out at the bus stop you know don't you know don't don't drive on the wrong side of the road the vast majority of social conditioning is good and absolutely necessary for the functioning of healthy but then of course there's that undue influence of social conditioning has where it wants you to just stay in the box it wants you to stay within the strict confines and parameters of behavior that you have been indoctrinated to think will protect you from the judgment of the group right so where does this come from again not to sound like a broken record we all know where it comes from it comes from the educational system that comes from your peer group it comes from your parents it comes from a religion it comes from corporate culture it comes from the media many different facets to social conditioning but generally you know there's a saying in Australia the tall poppy gets cut you know you stick your head out you try to express yourself a little too much there could be negative consequences so therefore you get people going out and they won't approach they want to step to the girl they want to be this charming individual that sweeps her off her feet however they have an inability to execute and then men often go into this paralysis due to the fact that they also have again these decades often times of negative social conditioning tell them to stay in their fucking box so they start to create these negative mental movies of how poorly it's going to go when they step so classic thing they see the girl there with a guy oh it's the boyfriend I want the boyfriend and he's gonna become hostile if I speak to his his girlfriend right so the thing is again this is speculation you don't know who it is now in the in the case of the original question here I kissed a fat girl at a bar because she was easier well how many times does this happen if you're going out answer me this you see two sets of girls you see you know a couple girls there that you consider very average you know sort of mousy girls again maybe a little little chubby or whatever whatever you want to call it in your mind you're like oh I'll go approach them that will be an easy set that will be an easy approach and then you go up to them you know thinking that they'll be of course they'll be so happy that someone like me is even speaking to them and then you go up and they're like get fuck away yeah and they're just they're completely unreceptive to it and actually like actively hostile your life but that was supposed to be the easy one I thought that was gonna be the easy one and then conversely you know you see this extremely attractive girl standing there at the bar with like a very like what kind of a bitchy face on and she's surrounded by three guys who are all these like big good-looking guys and you're like oh man this is gonna be hard but then for some reasonable you know you manage to screw up the courage to go and speak to her and then you open and she's a sight oh hey how are you and it turns out she was like resting bitchface right that's just what her face looks like and she's like super super friendly and then all her friends are like gay guys who are like oh we love you oh honey you have to fuck him right and they're like you're your allies and it's like that didn't go how I was thought it was going to go either so the point is this is all speculation on your part and speculation is inadmissible rather than thinking oh this one's going to be easier this one's gonna be a it's like just just go up find out don't speculate go find out and deal with it after the fact right the hot girl oh the hot girl is going to be easier easier easier if you're acting as though this is some sort of gamble where you're you're using some sort of currency that has meaning to you what are you losing from going up to the so called difficult hot blonde girl you're losing time that's it you're you're literally losing a chunk of time out of your life that is it it's not as though you're losing money it's not as though you're losing some sort of you know internal karma points or something that is gonna have some sort of quantifiable effect on your life it's it's not if you go speak to someone and they are uninterested in what you're saying to them and they turn they turn away and leave which is what ninety percent of so-called bad approaches look like it again it has zero effect on your actual life just because some person that you did not even know two minutes ago isn't absolutely enamored with you it means nothing so again it's like you have nothing to lose by finding out so for me I think that's one of the biggest lessons and I want to impart to any client is that there's nothing to lose and you don't know how anything is gonna turn out until you actually approach until you actually find out for yourself and calibrate after the fact and for example you know with the the guy there let's say it is the boyfriend the vast majority of the time unless you're going up and you're being like extremely uncalibrated or you know just emotionally dense or extremely aggressive versa or something like that just like very sloppy um there's gonna be like oh it's my girl forever together at which point you know I'm not I'm not there to cause some sort of Sue's me some sort of social error or some social social problem in the venue what I'll likely do is you know I'll probably like give them a little shitbag oh yeah so why you guys here this is for single people lord knows you gotta go to the farmers market tomorrow and they got some seasonal vegetables for your little Top Chef themed dinner party play some Settlers of Catan after perhaps maybe some cards against humanity' yeah awesome so so so you know at first when I started giving him shit they're kind of like but then as it becomes increasingly ridiculous they realize I'm just fucking with him like I'm just fucking he yes so hey what's up bla bla bla bla bla oh yeah you're from there oh cool interesting chat them for a couple minutes you know maybe even a minute tops I mean all right hey see you around have a great night guys boom out so now I built social proof with these people I build a rapport with these people so if I you know with another person another girl later in the night and they walk by like oh look it's that dude hey what's up man you know or shit maybe their turns out they're really cool maybe it turns out the dude can give you a business opportunity you don't know so in terms of this whole like speculating that the hot girl is more difficult what are you basing this speculation on experience or is it just because that's how it's supposed to be right the more I travel through life the more I realize I don't know shit about anything and I'm certainly not a clairvoyant and I can't predict how anything's gonna go I can't predict how one nights gonna go I can't predict how an individual approach is gonna go so he's got a he's got to put yourself out there roll with the punches go for what you want if you're eating again you should be ashamed because you didn't go out for what you wanted not because you know you you went for the subpar girl that your friends wouldn't think is cool so anyway on that note I'm gonna go ahead and sign off here as well if you're interested in seeing these concepts live you can ask your questions to me and have me answer them live be sure to check out the live events I have upcoming in here in San Francisco I'm going to Seattle at the end of this month and then I'll also be in Miami for the rsd World Summit from February 17th to the 23rd where all the RFC instructors come together from all over the world it's a phenomenal event a great battery recharge to reconnect with your passions for the game I'm beyond that I'm going to Austin Chicago and I will be in Europe this summer you want to take a bootcamp with me to be a great time to do it before I actually retire from this stuff not sure when that's gonna be but it's not going to be doing this forever so at least I don't think so anyway thanks for watching and I'll see you next time [Music],tAwb-NYNo7w
um say it's like towards the end of the night it's towards the end tonight okay so you're the cloth insurance runs me like that the last part of my whatever um so the question is when do you I do have a process you go about when you decide if you're gonna commit to a girl yeah okay got it here to me number one thing is logistics number one thing and this is what fuck's up intermedia guys okay guys who are good they can approach they have no problems they yes glad to get kissed doesn't enough the thing that fucks these guys up is logistics always they spend too much time with a girl with shit logistics the shit sticks just shit I don't know something like that but that wouldn't really didn't work out so uh yeah so they spend too much time with a girl with poor logistics guys going out tonight I would say you want to find that shit out as quickly as possible you guys did you find out logistics from every girl you interacted with that actually hooked no see you should be finding that shit out as soon as you get like a hook where they're talking you and it seems like it's going on I want you to drop that shit that is the shit that is one of the things that is gonna make make a guy crack that intermediate plateau right the intermediate purgatory you've all heard of that right what's intermediate purgatory it's where you're pretty good you know you can go up you get a traction pretty easily and get make outs phone numbers hell you even pull sometimes but you're just not getting laid as much as you would like or as much as you think you should be given your skill set so what is gonna like often has to be the thing that cracks that well one is becoming a master of logistics two is becoming a guy who's willing to make a bold move right because a lot of times sounds like it's going good if I make this bold move it might fuck it up just like in the beginning when you were afraid to do an approach because you might look stupid in the intermediate do I'll crack that you've got to be willing to make the bold move and pull the girl oh I feel someone's presence I have to gain after you pick up go up to this girl say something I just feel so much pressure I can't even speak my life well the funny thing about that is that that shit will go away because like it's eventually it's gonna become old hat you know much like I remember fuck I remember when I was first learning how to drive a car it was terrifying you know I could kill someone in this what the fuck to say in a video game like okay there's the car the thing the cloud and all the moving parts dude now you just hop into that shit you're like on the phone and you're fucking do I mean I have a hands-free device it can wait okay texting don't text while driving that's that's the second thing you get out of this fucking thing no text while driving it will become more and more familiar to you like I remember when I dude when I first started out I would literally go up to not even like a good club like a shit club like at my in my in San Francisco I go there and I hear the music that he's good I'd be like oh just the music Mike I'll fuck I got to do this I can't believe this shit oh my god you know now now I roll into like like for example when I go into like excess in Vegas I walk up those stairs and I walk on the thing I'm like yeah it's literally like I'm walking you're Space Mountain at Disneyland or something I'm like this is where I live this is like my place right so again as you get older and you you will cost you acclimate yourself to these environments more and more I mean dude if you really think about it the club is like one of the worst places for human beings to even be in it's like a fucking war zone or something it was like like flashing lights your face give you a fucking epileptic seizure there's like now they're playing fucking locomotive horns okay what is this shit what the fuck is this new development okay I remember I went to Miami last year and they're playing like a sound effect of a train I was like now they've installed an actual locomotive Horlick  for like 30 seconds straight in a mix in a closed space as the hoes bring out the little sparkler I'm like what in God's name is this shit you know next year I fully expect them to have installed like a Boeing 747 jet engine I'll fire up the jet engine someone ordered a bottle like what do they think it's like it's like like they're like they're like we've got a great new idea to be the most obnoxious hearing damage place in the world like I mean it's funny I have like I might I couldn't believe it I was like dude clubbing in 2015 farid strippers in an anthropomorphic animal costume a train launch we got the story you saw this fucking pink panther strippers the other night what the fuck is this shit maybe I was getting old dude I don't know man you fucking kids you fucking Millennials with your train horns millenials with your train horns but yeah but like you'll grow accustomed to it and the thing is the older you get - you want to look this is a big thing okay younger for younger guys out there you want to cultivate you wanna you want to cultivate depth okay what is depth it means you have a wide variety of it's interest you have a wide variety of hobbies you have a wide variety of life experiences a lot of guys can get good at like you know rudimentary game or you know even like they can get good at pulling girls from clubs but they can't keep the girl right maybe they don't want to this endless string of one-night stands it sounds terrible doesn't it a fate worse than death but like no like maybe you want to at some point keep the girl so you won't be able to do that because they're like oh it's just this veneer of fucking game right so what do you do cultivate a wide range of experiences why the life experience is travel a lot traveling is great for that in and of itself I knew this guy and I tell the story of loss you may have heard it before but like I had the student who was like 60 years old anything you could say to him he would have some fucking story about it you know like you could be like you know Zimbabwe he'd be like oh yes Zimbabwe in 1978 I took an expedition as in Bob with my good friend Mufasa where we encountered the indigenous but tumbu tribe and did it and I'd be like oh shit like I'll have some fuckers to worry about it right because he's so fucking old so that's the thing go accumulate life-experience accumulate fucking depth and then the thing is as and then really set your mind free to beat just fucking blurt I know I'm on Brad's bootcamp here he says like the first night is like verbal vomiting verbal vomiting no filter right of course guys often have difficulty reconciling to ideas what are these two ideas the idea they say you know just say whatever man but then on the other hand instructors say don't say stupid shit right right so how do you how do you reconcile those two ideas anyone anyone No  well here's the thing there's like look there's there are certain social rules like for example if I go up and I say are you on your period ho that sounds fucked up right that sounds like something that would get you blown out and it would the vast majority it would get you blown out the reason doesn't get me blown out just because when I say it it's obvious I know I'm breaking the social rule okay if you're saying stupid shit and you don't know you're breaking the social well if it's like you're saying it like do you think it's cool and like the girls like she can sense that you're just an idiot that's the blow out however if I say this idiotic thing but I'm like tongue-in-cheek about it I'm like yeah I know I'm breaking the social rule that makes it okay okay so again that you know that's how you kind of reconcile that idea of saying doing whatever you want and the thing is do even if you you understand some girls are not gonna like shit that you say you can't you can't get every fucking girl we don't see a rejection I was talking again to Derrick about this the other day we get we get rejected quote-unquote quite a bit because we're you know strong personalities we have strong personalities and not every girl's gonna like that you know but if I have to talk to twenty girls in order to find the one girl that like clicks with me I'm willing to talk to twenty fucking girls I can talk to twenty girls in the night okay but it's not always gonna be that sometimes it might be two girls sometimes I might be forty girls right but usually it's more like three but you know but but again the better you yeah like the more likely it's gonna be a lower number but still I know for some not for others Jeffie is for some not for others okay so the whole point that is this though I have to be the only way to that worse is if you're doing what you're supposed to be doing mechanically right if you're executing game if you're actually any proper fundamentals of game then you can say I'm not gonna reject it if you're doing if you're running shit game then you know you're not escalating you're not looking her in the eye you're not fucking you know you're trying to impress you're coming from like a cellar frame as opposed to a buyer frame all those things yeah you need to work on that stuff first but once you get that shit dialed if the girls not down with it I don't really give a shit it's like no harm no foul it's like okay have a good night you didn't click I'm willing to go through and find the girl that is down with my sense of humor okay cuz I say all kinds of stupid shit oh did I say that right so oh well you know I had some girl and girls will fucking doors will dis you for even the dumbest reasons man or no reason at all man you know any dumb fucking reason you look like some guy that she hates or anything of that nature so you can't take this shit personal you just have to have that mentality if I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing there is no rejection there's just lack of chemistry okay so that too will also help you I mean dude I had a girl reject me the other night I was in Texas and I said to her I voted for Obama because I thought it would be cool I saw on 24 they had a black president and he was real good and president Palmer I don't if you guys remember 24 president Palmer was the shit rest in peace but but and I thought it would be cool and she and I was like joking right although I actually kind of did vote for him because of that but that's actually I got effect is called the Palmer affected look it up on Wikipedia but anyway she's like what the fuck she's not you know what's wrong with this country you're a what's wrong with this country and like up until then it had been going perfect but oh well oh well she didn't like I voted for Obama because it started me cool I guess what it is cool so fucking,tFK7HA4m5U4
hi it's Jeff remember me I'm a professional kick up instructor and all-around douche fan and today I'm coming at you with the fourth installment of the execute the program 2.0 video series so in this one I'm going to talk about the phone game and I'm going to clear up exactly what is meant when you hear people talking about sending her so-called value giving texts so check it out so what the fuck is a value giving text essentially a value getting text it's the equivalent of something that a person would post on Facebook okay by providing information about your life and not asking for anything in return that is a response from the girl and one big confusion that I see is guys don't understand that value giving text should not be like random memes okay like I see that a lot guys are like sending random cat pictures don't be doing this you're not Deadpool okay lol chimichangas alright you want it you don't want to send this shit unless it's somehow relevant so for example sending this out of the blue is just odd if there's no context for it like some cat going pew pew pew I mean maybe if there were some kind of context for it like if you were talking about shooting someone or something like that it it it would make sense but here it does if it's out of the blue it's just bizarre this on the other hand even if you haven't been talking about dogs or anything like that it it makes sense because the context is that we are in a romantic relationship now I understand the line can get a bit fuzzy here but ultimately you always want to be thinking about what you are trying to communicate and further what your messages are saying about you as a person aka what are they sub communicating so what should a value giving text be well it could be something related to what we're talking about or something that takes something that you were talking about earlier in a new direction and that's a big part of what's called being witty okay so here's an example I was um telling this chick before that I needed to make a haircut like appointment right but I was like shit I'm afraid to call because I'm too high and I think if I call I'll sound fucking stupid like I'll be like do your total butt cut look and they'll know I'm high like right I was all paranoid I couldn't make and we were talking about that earlier and so here I reference that in a text out of the blue right and so in this case it's a funny callback humor so in a similar from there I'd probably you know if she responds to that then I'd be like let's meet up tonight right so in a similar vein I could send any anecdote about my day you know like I was at the DMV today I saw a guy that looked exactly like ol Dirty Bastard screaming he kept saying I'm disabled I'm disabled and so a woman said to him if you're disabled sir you need to be in this line to which he responded I'm not able I was like I got a little laugh out of that huh like so that would be like a value giving text another one would be like this I saw this at the store dinner right and I didn't actually see it so I solved my friend sent this to me lives in France and they have like Mexican burrito kit like oh I'm sure that's fuckin delicious the Mexican burrito kit from the French supermarket laughs so but again it's it's funny it makes you laugh and it doesn't ask anything of the girl that's kind of the the main criteria I'd say try and use stuff that you actually did that day or the day before even and just program eyes it so to speak like maybe you went to the dentist you could say I'm at the dentist I want to be totally fucking fresh for a romantic date or whatever or I just finished a grueling two hour workday and I'm finally ready to arrange the romance and then you go for the kill so in this example here this would be a good example of what I'm talking about so the guy he's like a medical student and he had to draw a picture like of a heart right so he's like drew some science shit and thought of you so that's again something he was doing that day sends it to her and bam yes she responds it all to this what does it tell you a lot of sushis interested no it does not tell you she's interested it tells you she's looking at her fucking phone that's it okay so that means the phones in her hand she's looking at it so now you go for the kill let's meet up later you know tonight let's meet up later night done on the other hand I would say that there is a time in a place for randomness okay to send random shit it's kind of complicated like it's a bit fuzzy but generally I would say I save randomness for girls that I already fucked okay so what would be a good example of that would be this a gif of Nicolas Cage flying through the cosmos with flowing hair while take on me plays in the background okay I mean it's pretty random but it's okay why because it's fucking awesome right so if it can be random is okay if it's fucking awesome so you might be asking yourself at this point like okay how do i define something as being value giving how is how is this an example of value giving again it means not asking anything to the girl not making her think or even feel obligated to respond but there is more to it than that like if you just texted a girl the sky is blue that's not asking for a response but I doubt that she would consider that value giving right think of it like this if you could post it on Twitter and lots of people would find it like a fun addition to their day it's value giving text right and look if you can't understand why a video of Nick Cage with long flowing hair transforming into outer space dust will take on me plays in the background is value giving I don't think there's any way I could explain it to you right it's just setting over a good emotion without expecting anything in return that's it if you find it lol funny that's generally a good guideline I mean if she disagrees well consider that part of the screening process because you're my you

"what up what up this is your proverbial boy Jeffy and I'm here today at pier 14 in San Francisco California to talk about the hyperbolic time chamber yes this is of course the magical training facility from Dragon Ball Z wherein you enter train for several years but on the outside only a fraction of that time is passed and what the fuck am I talking about you ask well I'm talking about the phenomenon wherein when you're deep in interaction with a girl that you're trying to interact with on a romantic level time seems to just pass like Einstein I believe famously said the best example of relativity is when you're sitting with a pretty girl hours seem to pass like bonus and this of course related to the phenomenon will be a million dollar mouthpiece the legendary skill from pimps of your to simply speak speak speak speak speak on an endless stream of I guess you call it bullshit and have to be compelling and have it be relevant I suppose to what you're discussing now I want to bring in my good friend mr. Owens cook let's do this the idea to talk about this came up the other day when we had a free tour here on Thursday epic turnouts pretty good and we had a massive storm on Thursday so your flight was delayed and he got in several hours late text me like yo I got this delayed flight situation I need you go up there and just fucking handle it to like get there like what time you got to come in there's a couple probably like 11 like the ship starts at 7:00 so what am I going to do well I was like you know alright I know I could do this shit I've been doing this shit for 15,000 years I'm going to be able to get up there and crank it so long story short I get up there and I start riffing right and you know me it's like he always says this to me it's like let's go up and go up on stage for a little bit and like now don't want to but once I get up there I I don't want to come off he doesn't like state changes so he's not up there that he doesn't want to change a state then he's up there he doesn't want to change things so it's like an inertia you know it's like I'm not scared to get out of bed in the morning it's just so comfortable you know it's like a dare to get up there I'm just like oh god I don't want to think that problem - money and so on and so forth right so but then I get up there and I'm like okay yeah he's gonna be here a while I'm gonna be up for a while I look up and he just walks in and it seems like 40 minutes of tasks and I look down and it's been like 3 and a half hours and me and Luke have just been up there riffing and like having a ball and a hell of a time up there and we start we kind of got to talking about it and a similar phenomenon seems to happen when you're talking to a girl at the club or you know the day game whatever you're picking up a girl it's just like time flies when you're fucking having fun and I tell students all the time because one of the biggest problems I see with students is they come in and they just try to go for the kiss so quickly and I'll be like how long do you think it should take you to get to the kiss on average I mean of course it's never wise to indulge in generalizations but you know as a rule of thumb how long do you think and they're like two minutes like well that can certainly happen and sometimes you get a lightning strike and that's a special skill in and of itself is being able to recognize when you make that eye contact and it's you know the ability to just go for that is to make up there but as a rule of thumb generally I find it's going to take like 10 15 even 20 minutes maybe even 30 minutes that's how solid you want exactly gives their advanced what kind of game you want to play you know but let's still like if you're playing like a relatively safe game not super safe but you're just trying to kind of somewhere in the middle I take like 20 minutes now gosh Wow seems like a long time like that's not a long time at all and insofar as like a same night poll is concerned ie from meet to leave the club together on average that seems to take in my experience at least about 45 to 90 minutes and they're like wow that seems like a long time like if you're in there with the girl and you've got like a nice bubble going on it's going to pass like that and I can't clap the earth snap because I have gloves on but you know it's going to pass like nothing so I don't know what's your experience on this or thoughts on this phenomenon and why this happens how it happens how we can take advantage of in my experience a major major skill in game is being very associated to what you're doing and the reason why is you're going up to random people you never met and you're trying to get them to stop what they're doing and to come into what you're doing so they have their own agenda their own their own desires and it probably doesn't involve fucking pasty midgets hahahaha you know so we got to do a little voodoo here to get it going so that being the case you know we want to be very associated to what we're doing and so it's like we're creating this kind of like alternate reality I've actually heard you describe it like that is like you're creating this like alternate world I mean used to describe that you're old hyah yeah it's like it's like a cereal dream like alternate plane of reality that you're like inviting them to join you in yeah and the rules don't count there because in because you know to be seductive you're trying to get them to go outside of what they're used to doing right like even to be a great salesperson for example you know you're going to sell to people who might not be keen on spending money and to be good at sales you've got to get people to be open to spending money so you've got to get them into a state where they want to buy well in the same way with a girl in the same way with a girl that girl might not want to have sex with a pasty midget who she just met in a van she might not want a bald old man who looks like he's becoming Andrew Weil the health guru 20 years ago to have sex with her but what we do is we want to create a very associative timeless zone where you're so associate to what you're doing so as we're gaming it's like we're joking and each joke that's the thing that we're doing like that's the joke now it's all about now and you don't like like eat like we're going to go here very immediate yeah yeah yeah the immediate sounds like an immediacy because I mean when you go down sex it's like this is what we're doing now so it's so everything's like we're gonna go eat here we're gonna go do this this is so funny ha ha ha ha ha look at that ha ha ha ha oh my god oh look at this oh dude it no no way ha ha ha wait come on wait it's like the first joke to ever have been told in human history every joke you tell you know it's like this is I just invented jokes that's a great analogy yeah look like like now we're gonna do it like like like come here yes food I just invented kissing I got an idea let me put my face on your friend and see what happens this is job you know yeah it's like this immediacy and enthusiasm so what he's saying is like you know we both notice when we're doing public speaking that you don't even have to have anything prepared and hours can go by now in a proper event we have a structured curriculum that we talk for yours but in events where we're doing meeting grades like free tours which is go for hours and the cool thing about it is that we're fully associated to what we're doing everything's like the greatest thing ever in this moment the energy is going up and up and up and that really happens from getting present because when you're kind of in the moment your energy does go up and up so it's kind of a natural thing that have happened and from there that's just a very seductive quality that you can pull people in your world now that the cool side of this and I think to me this is the best part is that when you live your life like this guess what like some more foot anyway so you know you're thinking oh why do I have to do that for sex but in reality life is more fun when you're doing that anyway and what is what is sex itself it's like oh I'm touch here I'm kissing her I'm coming that that is a prelude to sex is the associative sex is the ultimate Association well you can even train gross a couple they want to come is you got to get them associated orgasm so associative this as the timeless bubble as Jeff said powerful powerful skill set to gain rather than trying to wear leather get the kiss now because I don't feel happy now I don't feel comfortable now I've got to get to the next thing in the future okay use your a card you can say get to the future gotta get to the future it'll be better in the future better there it'll be so much better and finally kiss you but the present is now so associate enjoy we amidgett get laid wake up good print yep resume wait do you miss yeah that's Joe yeah  see you see you later like/subscribe smack that fucking like button motherfucker smash that like button I wanna get 10,000 life in this I'll cut my dick off and feed it to my dog",teFtj0Ad45c
what up what up this is your proverbial boy Jeffy didn't real social dynamics and welcome to the third installment of the execute the program 2.0 video series so we took a look at your profile yesterday and now it's time to move on to the next step and that is of course the messages that you send out to girls and the ensuing conversation all the way through to the phone game in a similar vein to the profile however most guys seem to have their heads buried far far up their own ass when it comes to what to say once they've got a girl interested now the original ETP went a long way towards correctness and removing said heads from said rectums however there were still a lot of gray areas that people weren't able to wrap their heads around completely or so it would seem so in execute the program - we up the fucking ante with a whole bonanza of new explanations information and tips including the investment ratio ok and this one is huge awareness of how much investment the girls given you is pretty much the single most important thing in determining what your next step should be whenever possible you want to be less invested than the girl is however there are also many situations they are going to be put in where you will need to invest slightly more than her in order to continue the conversation or escalate things forward and the key here is to do it in a controlled fashion and in execute the program - I explained exactly how to do this in full detail you'll also learn how to take my own lines from the original program and spin them into your own unique funnel based on your personality that will never ever get you called out for being canned or even worse get you exposed on the date itself for not being congruent with what you message her ok we'll also talk about tonality and in other words how precisely how to be cooler than the girl and how to really convey that sort of weaning above it all attitude via text ok you're going to learn how to weave statements of intent into your funnel so they're almost subliminal and that the girl tacitly accepts them without it actually messing up your investment ratio you'll get a breakdown of exactly how to construct a unique message funnel step-by-step what exactly each step should consist of and when exactly to deploy each step to move things forward in the most efficient way I'm gonna teach you what really counts in an opener when it comes to results okay aka actually getting meetups and sex and I'll revealed the four important characteristics that your opener absolutely must have okay you'll also learn the biggest trap that guys fall into when they're trying to use kind of cheeky lines that ends up completely neutering them and in fact makes you look worse than before so I'll teach you how to avoid this so you can express yourself like a badass congruently furthermore I'll teach you when it's appropriate to shrug off for tests and plow and when it's more appropriate to actually go genuine and connect so understanding this distinction can be the difference between getting blocked by err and actually meeting up with her I'll also show you how to convey a sort of dreamlike ethereal presence that ends up creating a low-pressure situation for her to go on the date and actually fuck you with no social pressure furthermore you're gonna hear about dozens of case studies and examples of real-life interactions that were not represented in the original program okay so now I want you to check out this clip from UTP too and in this I'm going to explain how to avoid flatlining okay and that's of course when you have a seemingly good back-and-forth going with the girl and then it just fizzles out for no apparent reason and this is super annoying I mean I know it happens to all of us but after this you'll know how to ensure that it doesn't happen again let's talk about another issue that guys we're concerned with which was that they say you know I'd start messing with the girls and then it flat lies it just kind of fizzles out so in order to avoid flatlining I'd say number one you want to keep responses to anything that's said on her side brief and illogical second you want to package these responses with a ramp message that's taking things up to the next level and then third ask questions as little as possible again only ask the basic DTF screening questions if you're on tinder and I would ask no questions on OkCupid because again screen you can already see on her profile so again like like one message of questions maximum ultimately it's about moving things forward while achieving the right tone and this is sort of a nebulous idea but we've nailed on a lot of practical things since ETP one that can help you achieve that correct tone you want to come across as sort of above it all if that makes sense for example on the group some guys suggested sending a girl the the message you have the chubbiest lowell it's bunny cheeks ever I could squeeze them all day personally I don't like to talk about touching them in any way or making any objectifying comments about their person again I'm pretty above it all if that makes sense like I'm just casually fucking around on the side but I'm open to meeting someone if they're cool right IATA the same infield I'd say my attitude when I'm in field and on the site is I'm almost like this alien who does not need to eat breathe sleep or have sex and finds it funny and sort of gross that she does now it in a similar vein it's the same shit with like watching visitors to your profile and shit like that don't pay attention right you don't pay attention so now let's go deeper on these tone issues so before I sign off here I do want to take a moment to encourage you to sign up to the VIP interest list below VIP members get a special bonus package for me chock full of amazing goodness and first off you're of course gonna get everything from the original ETP bonus pack

it's your proverbial boy uncle Joey I mean Jeffy and I'm here today to ask you a very important question whatever happened to predictability the fucking milkman the paper boy and online game the actual topic today is gonna be this online game does it help or does it hurt your real life Cole approach [Applause] [Music]  this is a sentiment I see a lot on the inner circle groups and it's guys saying like don't do this gender bullshit it actually depletes your ability to do approach in real life so today that's the question I want to address and put this thing to bed once and for all okay so we're gonna attempt to do that now now full disclosure before we get into this I got to say that I am in fact biased when it comes to this issue and you know really there's nothing wrong with having two asses but what I mean by being biased is not that I have two asses but rather that I'm predisposed to say that online game can actually help your old approach games with some caveats now why am i biased well obviously I created a program called X and get the program a few years ago which I I really wanted to I didn't do an online game for many many years ever since the days of MySpace I was getting laid off myspace off Yelp calm if you can believe that but I've been doing it for many years so I decided I wanted to make a very comprehensive encyclopedic guide a system if you will a soup to nuts everything including the kitchen sink system that would help guys kill it in on my game as well as I do and so I immerse myself and obviously fell off the face of the planet for three years Tyler's like where the hell is this guy and but I was going on thousands and thousands of dates I slept with hundreds of girls off online and I created execute the program so obviously I am a pretty big proponent of that but you know if I'm gonna be completely objective I see that there is a point to a lot of what these guys are saying so yeah it could help but it could also hurt but it can also help it can help but it could hurt okay so let's explore right now how it could hurt your game there's a lot to unpack here but at the end of the day what hurts your real-life game is not doing real life game so online it's not going to do anything directly to have a negative effect but it can affect it indirectly if you're using it as a rationalization to not actually go out and do cold and you'll hear that a lot to guys who are either too lazy to go out or guys who are scared to go out and do a cold approach they will use online - as a way to avoid that well I can just you know you know swipe on my phone and I can say to myself I'm taking action right it's going good so but let's face it those guys they weren't gonna go out anyway right the guys who were too lazy or scared to go out real life they weren't gonna go out anyway they'll often see the opposite as well which is guys who are a pretty decent real-life game talking trash about the online game because it's a different modality and they're not having success with it so they've got this ego wrapped up in the fact that they can go out and actually pick up in real life and then they try their hand at tinder or whatever and they don't get success so then they get kind of like a sour grapes thing going on where they're like well you know it's just too much competition there's no way to cut through the noise you know the girls are just on there for validation etcetera etcetera it sucks so again that's another reason why you might often hear guys talking trash - in fact you'll actually see a lot of guys on the execute the program Facebook group who fall into this mode or fall into this category rather who were actually good at IRL game and then when they joined the ETP group they struggled with it a lot and it took a lot of critique on their profiles and they were doing a lot of really dumb things that really don't work online but once they wrap their head around it they started having massive success as well and they expressed that sentiment as well like yeah that's why I had that kind of sour grapes element to it but once I wrap my head around it I understand it now and it just becomes another well to draw water from right so again that's how you should think of it not like one's better or worse than the other but that it's again just draw water from all sources but even those guys once they got it down they started absolutely killing it as well and then a lot of those guys expressed the sentiment that well now that I'm killing it equally in either arena it's I don't really have as much motivation to go out because why would I when I could just sit at home and basically order it to my house as opposed to having to like go out park the car go into the club drop around for a couple hours so again there is that convenience factor when you get good at it especially that that can actually give you a lot more reluctance to go out and I've I've struggle with that as well I don't know if it's a struggle necessarily but I've experienced that as well for sure where it's like well you know this is working out pretty damn well for me as it is so why would I alter in you know bother going out so again in that respect I can see how it might have an effect it might have like an actual quantifiable effect if that's something that you've been experiencing as well now if that's the case and you actually find yourself actually going out in real life and doing real life called approach less because you just don't see as much of a need to do so because you're having success online then I could see it having some effect and but what is the effect like let's get down to brass tacks er what is the actual effect that it's gonna have the detrimental effect I mean really thinking about it the most it's gonna do it's going to probably cause your initial approach game and your open game to suffer right that's literally the only areas that you're gonna see an actual effect in you might you know because you're not you'll be a little bit rusty maybe you have been going out as much so when you do go out maybe your approach game is not as hard not as OnPoint maybe you have a little bit of that old approach anxiety flaring up again that you didn't they have an experience in years because you haven't been out in a while maybe your open game when you actually the initial step because let's face it when you're actually stepping to the girl and you're you know opening a stranger in real life you're there's a lot of different dynamics and a lot of different variables that come into account including like your tonality that include again facial expressions little micro emotional nuances that come into play that again maybe since you haven't had to open IRL in a while that's gonna suffer and you're gonna have a little bit of rust but aside from that I don't see anything after that being affected right now by the way I advocate doing both right I know and again I'm guilty this I've been slaying it I mean if I'm slaying it online why should I go out and I've said this before if if for some reason like clubs disappeared from the earth I could still get laid pretty much every single day for the rest of my life just doing it online like I would never have to go to a club ever again if I didn't want to now I like it and I again I advocate for both but they're different things like right IRL game the cold approach game that's actually kind of like a full-contact sport right it's visceral its immediate it's exhilarating oftentimes and again you can actually I'd say another benefit is there's gonna be you just know right off the bat whether there's chemistry or not you know with online a lot of the time you might go on like a date and then the chick sucks and it's kind of like almost like it feels like a wasted night but you know often times are going on these dates in like Monday night so it's like what the hell was good anyway right but but still that's a consideration but at the end of the day the girls are often Potter you know you know there's no trying to suss out the pictures and whether or not they're accurate and so on and so forth so again I advocate for both there's pros and cons to each you got the convenience tractor with online you've got all the things I just mentioned for IRL like I said I rose at like the full contact sport whereas the online it's kind of more like a chess match or playing several different hands of Poker at once it's a little more strategic there's a little more thought that goes into the funnel and so forth but again I advocate for both I enjoy both and like I said draw water from all sources if you get good at online then yeah your approach might suffer but the rest of the the rest of the funnel the rest of the structure the rest of the game say is the same in fact and here's the flipside getting good online can actually help you and you might be saying well how how can it actually have an effect on your cold approach IRL game well here's what I'm talking about let's say that you have a full newbie like a like a guy who has starting from scratch like basically not even a white belt okay he's never set foot in the door he's never set foot in a club he goes to the club he's terrified he's barely even knows how to touch a girl for this guy it can help him to actually build a sense of abundance right I've seen this happen again and again and again on the ex-new at the program Facebook group you get a guy with very little experience and yet he fumbles and stumbles and sucks but he's able to actually start to go on dates with girls he's able to actually start interacting with girls and then sooner or later you know he's gonna get good at it and then next thing you know he's had sex with some girls and he's had sex with ten girls he's had sex with 20 girls that's with 30 girls and now he can actually go to the club and what is the actual effect of this well it's putting in his mind the fact that this guy he's like I am sex worthy right kid like for a guy who has no experience for just to throw him into the club game often times he can't even fathom that they would like him to begin with you know he's bombarded with a variety of conditioning that tells him what you know like they're here to hook up with shad or whatever you know some stay only like the six-foot 3 squared Ron looks money status guy well now this guy has very visceral proof that girls actually want to fuck him because 30 of these girls have actually fucked him in the past so now he can step into the club and realize girls like me I've seen it here's the proof what's the proof I've gotten with 30 of them now so it can kind of be helpful for for guys who were just starting out to get the ball rolling if you will and bit start to build that sense of sex worthiness start to build that sense of abundance so then they can actually even begin to tackle the IRL game so for newbies it can be helpful for them to build that abundance and get over that hump and just build a rotation so they start to see themselves as worthy and it really is like training wheels just like one date at a time one step at a time just follow that execute the program system until they get that validation if you will that proof that they're worthy and look I know that they'll just do it approach to just go out as max always says that's a great approach as well and you know for a lot that actually it's a lot more expedient if we're being honest here but for some guys the baby steps approach works just fine now another thing to note about online is that there is sort of like as I mentioned earlier there's a bit of a quality drop to real life like let's face it you're not gonna get this like deluge of nines off of online game you know as I've always said it's like an all-you-can-eat buffet of 7s the occasional eight and maybe once a year if you're grinding it out hard you'll get like a very very attractive girl out of that and you know again there is no comparison I'm the first to admit that the quality from girls that you're gonna get when you go out in real life as much much hotter but here's the thing that can also serve that inverse relationship that can also serve as a motivation for guys to start going out in real life again they get good at the online game they're like okay that's great you know I've had a ton of 7s if you will but I want to hit that next etholon so now I to do that I got to go out so that can kind of be the impetus to kind of give them that little push to actually start going out and actually start doing real-life cold approach the thing is to once you start going out it really helps to kind of you know be and not give a Fox Vil if you will because you you just think if I don't pull tonight I just have that rotation I can just call up one of my online girls and I can you know still get laid that night so it kind of helps to cultivate that and another thing to note I had one guy say because I asked guys this question on the ETP group and one guy he said you know it really helped me to be able to hold a set for a longer time like more than an hour and I noticed this a lot I see new guys on boot camp and when they go out that you see these guys just trying to like run through sets like super quick like they're in there for like a minute at a time three minutes at a time they go for they're going for like numbers after three minutes cuz they think that's how it works look a wise man once said the patient man wins the game most sets from open to leave the club together are gonna take like 45 to 90 minutes so you need to be able to like know what it's like to hang in there so going on those dates that can kind of help to give you an idea of what that is that can help you to be able to stick in a set for an hour and still know what to say right and here's the thing the the game the game after that approach and open which we said again earlier if you're not going out and you're just doing IRL that can suffer but still after that that that initial phase of the game it is identical it's essentially identical people a lot of guys will say well shit you know this are this online shed it's not real game like in what sense in what sense is it not real game because look even if you get the girl on tinder once you go on the date you still got a pimper on the date you still gotta know how to fucking pimp it on the date itself it's not like you just like swipe swipe on tinder the girl agrees to go out with you and they're just like sucks your dick within 5 minutes like you still have to actually know what you're doing and know how to escalate with the girl know how to converse with her and know how to build comfort and know how to do the poll etc etc etc so like I said it's identical after that and one guy also noted that you know he said Jeff when I went to your hot seat I was really astounded at how much like overlap you know the Venn diagram if you will like how much of your game is identical what I saw in the hot seat of you doing cold approach to what I saw in execute the program of you going on these actual dates it's pretty much identical I pretty much say and do the exact same things on an online date that I'm doing after the open in a real-life cold approach so again there's a ton of overlap so for a lot of guys doing an online game it can really help them to sort of hammer that stuff that you do after the social hook point right without having to spend a lot of time trying to get to that point right so you go straight on the date and basically it's like skipping the opening the approach and spending a lot of time in that space after the social hook point without having to run around to Club and try to find a girl that'll actually hook so again like I said past that point online is pretty much the same with accept without friend logistics and Club logistics you know a lot of guys say again like I said they're like well it's not real game right it's like what is real game dude real game is game that gets you results period you understand you know going out with a lot of new guys and seeing a lot of the newer guys and allow even a lot of the inner circle guys out you know cuz I can always spot an inner circle crowd from a quarter mile away you'll note there's like this obsession with just doing like a lot of flashy or ridiculous things that don't necessarily get results right they're doing all this wacky weird shit almost who impress their friends it's almost become some kind of like weird religion at this point you know it's like not real game it's like look I'm fine with getting my proverbial dick sucked and not having to you know do the spin handshake 50 times in the club or whatever right so ultimately real game is what gets you results like I said before there's a ton of guys out there who are really good at doing the cold approach game but then you look at their online profile and it's just absolute garbage so it's like no wonder these guys bash online game so just to recap online game could theoretically hurt if you're using it as an excuse to not go out but even then it's only going to really get you rusty on that open and approach game but online game could also help you by getting you again a new guy to build up abundance and a sense of self-worth sex worthiness also to help you learn what it's like to run a set after the initial hook and to learn how to do that repeatedly in a very short period of time and like I said you can have success with both if but they're different modalities and you're gonna have to accept that right but after you've accepted that and after you've learned each modality draw water from all sources because why the fuck would this have been Jeffie and I'll see you next time I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating i perfected a program that completely automates the process to get any dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do it's over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of aim filled footage broken down case studies and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you pull her that night I covered the exact repeatable pattern takes to take a girl home nearly eighty five percent of the time she agrees to meet up with me at bottom line to just plain works decide off as we wanna start getting laid and execute the program [Music],us9DVZsVCTw
yo what up Jeffy here today I wanted to address a phenomenon that I've been seeing around the internet sort of a cultural zeitgeist if you will and I'm hearing a lot of chatter let's see a lot of comments about how in 2016 it kind of seems like there's this huge culture war taking place right you know this or this battle of the sexes almost and it's you know it's not just feminism versus pickup it seems like the conversation on any big is a big visceral issue is becoming just a lot more shrill and it's just ratcheting it up to like insane insanely antagonistic levels whether that's you know get feminism versus pick up whether that's race issues whether that's religious issues what-have-you political issues where people seem to be afraid of even interacting with each other in public anymore but what you need to understand and what I've come to understand over the past couple years as a person who has been a target of various activists and ideologues and and the like is that the way you are perceiving the battle lines is fundamentally flawed and the battle here it's not between the red pill MRA /pu A's and feminists it's not it's not PUA vs. feminism in reality what you're witnessing is a war between the hardcore ideologues on both sides and reasonable people all right so it's it's it's again it's between a hardcore ideologues and reasonable people and let me explain that a little further so on both sides of any issue you've got the hardcore ideologues whose lives seem to be absolutely consumed by this shit and to be fair a lot of the most vocal people are actually professional activists that is it is their job regardless of whatever altruistic elements there may be to what they do ultimately at the end of the day they're they're trying to get a paycheck and these are the people on both sides that you will often most most often see making these sweeping generalizations based on a person's gender religion or whatever and who seem to have a variety of issues that fuel this irrational anger and if you listen to these people you definitely get a sense that they're looking for payback for some perceived injustice that they feel was inflicted upon them by women or men you know on the other side of this issue so you so you've got those people and then you've got everybody else now most reasonable people want to live in a world that's fair to everyone and our open to ideas that might help us all get there all right most people like you and I do not dismiss people simply for their gender or make sweeping generalizations about groups of people or think of people as members of a group first and as individual humans second if at all okay again most reasonable people don't do that but the thing is nobody actually thinks of themselves as an unreasonable demagogue especially unreasonable demagogues so what they end up doing is they'll simply appropriate the label that has the most relevance to their interests for example men's rights activists or feminists and these people also tend to yell the loudest both in real life and on the Internet whereas most reasonable people have shit to do right they have other stuff to do you know then write these endless screeds on the internet about how the world view is awesome and how everyone else is fucking Satan so what ends up happening is in light of this all of the same people can very easily get the impression that these are in fact the true battle lines and it's at that point that any sort of constructive dialogue and potential resolution are simply drowned out by inflammatory inflammatory excuse me accusations against the so called bad people now in a way if you really look at it the extremists on both sides of an issue are actually some symbiotic in a way and they actually help each other proliferate in fact there have risen up entire industries okay and case in point would be the new media and the practice of so-called iterative journalism and narrative over story journalism for most among them that actually encouraged they encouraged extremist bickering for profit so again you've got these extremists on both sides with a symbiotic relationship many of them professional thriving off this sort of warring this this bickering and then you've got the media encouraging both of them because it makes good click made right and it's very important to note that in the last decade or so our primary news sources became for-profit entities whereas news used to be something that networks did without concern for profit and it's very interesting how this kind of happened without anybody noticing or even seeming to care and I think that it was in large part because we were distracted by other stuff such as the various wars that if America was embroiled in you know terror and to maybe a lesser degree the global financial crisis of 2008 you know the housing bubble thing but the bottom line is we what we get now we now get whatever sells the most advertising which is if it bleeds it leads right if you ever seen the movie Nightcrawler it's a good pretty scathing condemnation of this right so we get the juicy scandal stories but never the outcome of the investigation which disproves the allegations all right news channels have the legal right to lie and many have been caught doing so with zero ramifications or Consequences and the end results we've become a country and there's an America of near illiterates that cannot discern truth from fiction or fact from opinion in other words if it's on the TV it must be true it's on TV you know you know also it's kind of a side note I think that a lot of the criticism towards pick up is rooted in the belief that casual sex is inherently wrong right I mean yeah I know on the one hand it might seem like a guy who hooks up with a lot of girls is celebrated in our culture but I think that ultimately there is a deeply puritanical streak running through today's society which believe it or not is still firmly in the grip of religious conservatism and if you don't believe me you know let's put it this way nobody's getting elected say god is dead so you know society at large will see someone who pursues a lot of casual sex and they'll be like oh there's there's something wrong with this guy you know I suspect a lot of it is basic jealousy by people who are incapable of going out and attracting someone easily you know of course they'd never admit this and they have a variety a whole slew of other rationalizations for their stance towards you know so-called pickup artists you know it's somehow manipulative it's disrespectful players have emotional problems and can't form bonds with other people there's something wrong with them they get STDs etc etc these are the kind of the common the common call outs you'll see towards players quote unquote now I mean in rebuttal to those accusations or whatever I'd say as fall as far as morality is concerned well in my opinion that's rooted in honesty and your own ethics and relationships I mean as long as nobody's being deceived well adults can choose to be around whomever they want you know research in fact shows that non-monogamous people are no more or less dysfunctional neurotic psycho or generally fucked up than people in monogamous relationships however because being good at pickup requires well-developed people skills as well as self-actualization we tend to be more self-aware better communicators and have a better sense of self you know so I'd argue in many ways we're more well-adjusted you know as far as the they have trouble with commitment and emotional problems accusation the assumption here is that intimacy can only be achieved in monogamy and having more than one relationship somehow dilutes the intimacy right it basically you're saying love is a quantifiable thing if you have a hundred pounds of love you can give a hundred to your partner but if you have more than one partner you've got to split it right so you got to ask what is intimacy in my opinion intimacy is being open honest and vulnerable with a partner bonding on a deep level and monogamy does not automatically guarantee this any more than you know seeing multiple people correlates with lack of it the loss say oh there's just promiscuity right what is your just being promiscuous it's true we we might fuck a ton a ton of girls but it's not all about sex I have many relationships with that aren't you know super some super pair-bonded the bf/gf fucking monogamous scenario and I get a lot of things from them I get friendship camaraderie support you know but having said that banging a ton of girls isn't a bad thing either you know the clap people say well you just haven't found the right person it's like actually I found several as far as like you get STDs all this fuckers got STDs it's like look having multiple partners not put you at a higher risk for STDs going raw dog does okay there's no evidence that non-monogamous people have higher levels of STDs than monogamous people so you know just get tested always use a condom with girls you're not pair bonded to but anyway going back to the main point in this environment it's quite easy to believe that the world today is embroiled in this like epic culture war with these strictly delineated sides but in reality it's just that the assholes are yelling the loudest and further as I said there are a multitude of for-profit enterprises that actually thrive on feeding this perception so having said that what can a regular person do in the face of all this first off you have to be willing to object to the extremist assholes who appropriate your own desire to change the world and say you know hey buddy not not in my name bro so in other words you know start close to clean up your own house first so if you're involved in any movement you know whether it's feminism or say you're uh you're involved in learning how you know success with women make a pickup artistry if you're on forums or your facebook feed or whatever and you see idiots on there promoting counterproductive violent simplistic regressive ideas you call their shit out right fix your own house first furthermore it's very important that you check your own eagerness to be a part of a special group and align yourself with a particular ideology and look at people on a case-by-case basis that's what I do I don't look at people as like all women or all Republicans or all Muslims you know Muslims or whatever every single person you meet has a unique background as well as strengths weaknesses etc and by acknowledging this on an ongoing basis you yourself avoid falling into those same old traps of stereotypes and misunderstandings and you move towards a place of genuine connection and genuine solutions so the bottom line is don't let the assholes frame the conversation keep a positive attitude be kind and compassionate to people and just keep on moving forward as best you can so again this has been Jeffie and i'll see you next time please like and subscribe for more if you enjoy this and I'll see you see you next Tuesday for more here on my wonderful camp god bless,vDoCWUMxhhU
good day it is I your proverbial boy Jeffy coming at you today from my studio where I'm working on getting some infield together I wanted to put this out this week featuring some salacious footage that I recorded a couple weeks ago in Miami as you can see it's a bit on the untoward side uh-huh but it looks like the edits a little more complicated than I thought so it's gonna have to wait till next week however I did want to crack out a quick bit of value for you here and as I looked up above my workstation here there's a framed poster that I've put there specifically to give me inspiration when I'm feeling a little frustrated or overwhelmed with my workload and you know this is kind of my my work ethic in tablet form if you will so I thought I'd share that with you today and I'm gonna pan up here and I'll read it out to you out loud believe in your fucking self stay up all fucking night work outside of your fucking habits know when to fucking speak up fucking collaborate don't fucking procrastinate get over your fucking self keep fucking learning form follows fucking function a computer is a lite brite for bad fucking ideas find fucking inspiration everywhere fucking networked educate your fucking client trust your fucking gut ask for fucking help make it fucking sustainable question fucking everything have a fucking concept learn to take some fucking criticism make me fucking care use fucking spellcheck do your fucking research sketch more fucking ideas the problem contains the fucking solution think about all the fucking possibilities  so like I said I just keep that shit above my workstation I can glance up at it and I find if you live by those rules no matter what you do I mean this actually got a good fucking design advice if you've got a good fucking design device cons again get a print for yourself but I find that living by this work ethic is it's pretty on point  see you next week  you,vdLvn3arStQ

yo yo what up it's your proverbial boy weasel-faced McGee and I'm here today in San Francisco to talk to you about why you should always ask for more more what more everything more money more sex more more MORE [Music] I've a friend who's a designer he was very uncomfortable with asking for more money I got another friend and this guy is absolutely shameless no matter what product he's he's selling he is just utterly ruthless and shameless even if I asked this guy to help me do some production work he he's like I'll give you the bro rate dude and it's like fifty bucks off like even his friends he's always asking for more money because at the end of the day you got to understand if you're selling a product and that product is worth something you deserve something in return you've got to know your own worth with game I see a lot of guys who are great at selling the product right they're really great at doing the hey hey here's here's what I'm offering today what's dick great dick here's the features Digita and maybe even the girl is kind of like yeah I like it I'm down with this I want to I want I want to buy where do I sign on the dotted line but then they never closed the deal they never go for the sale now I was also massively guilty of this back in the day until a close friend of mine this kid named Christophe he actually told me he's like Jeff you know I notice he's French so he said Jeff I noticed you know you spend a lot of time in the comforts building but you you never go for escalation right and I realized that he was correct I would talk to the girl and it was going well and she was into me and she was excited to be talking to me and you know continuing to speak to me which would lead one to believe that if I were to try to take it to a romantic level she would be inclined and open to that idea however I never took to that level why because I was too comfortable in that zone and I was afraid to close the deal and once this was pointed out to me I started to be a lot more conscious of actually taking it to the next level purposefully if you aren't willing to let go of the opportunity you're not going to be able to close confidently right you you need to be able to walk away from it you need be coming at it from a place of abundance another thing and where I was coming from initially was this idea like well it's going well so I don't want to ruin it so the big mental ship that helped me was the realization that if you go for the clothes you go for the sale if you will and it doesn't work out it's not like oh I ruined it it's more a case of I found out that's the that's the biggest mental shift I think newbies need to make you're not ruining in it you're finding out that this person had no intention of hooking up with you to begin with right so that was a huge mental shift for me now of course this is contingent upon you actually closing it smoothly right because a lot of guys I get it I totally understand when you're first starting out you may not be doing it very smoothly maybe you're doing it awkwardly you know you're afraid to actually go for the goal so it's gonna seem stilted and awkward and it's gonna cause a poor reaction or conversely maybe you you arrive at the point where well I can't be a pussy you know I need you I guess that didn't work so now I need to go hard and then you go to aggressive and I'm totally on the same page with most people who are starting out who might be watching this video I came from there from that place so I understand asking can feel very awkward like going for the clothes can seem very awkward but it's only going to get better if you practice it that's the only real way I mean there is no shortcut you've just got to do it until you get better at it now another key to is not being like I'm not trying to logically fight with them if they say you know that's a huge thing I see you guys doing they're like we'll why not do the why not they go logical big mistake another one is getting like pouty and like the whole emotional vibe changes and the girls like what does it tell her this guy's a butthurt pussy and there is perhaps no more unattractive quality than neediness but the key here is what not becoming like angry like will why not and logically trying to convince not becoming a pouty little you know whiny little baby who start gonna beggar but rather just kind of laughing it off as though nothing unusual just happened they want you to succeed because what you have to consider is that you know this girl is if you were talking about a nightclub environment if she's talking to you for any length of I'm she's making she's made a decision to continue speaking to you for that long and you might say well whoop Dee fucking do-right but what you need to consider is likely in that nightclub environment she's blown off several codes if you will who have come up to her with some lackadaisical approach half stepper or some creeper shit where they like coming up and saying hey you're beautiful and put her hand in her lower back so she's made that decision to continue speaking with you this long she wants you to succeed if she's out there on a date with you it's even more she's make she's chosen to set aside this time to meet you out with the express intent of pursuing a romantic encounter right so she wants you to succeed on that level right and furthermore on a certain love she's probably also like does he like me you know you got to understand girls are not these like social monsters who are like perfectly versed in every nuance of social dynamics you know they have their own insecurities too and she's probably like again if she's not just like I hope he doesn't screw it up right she's probably like does he like me so again she's given you that chance so you got to understand that and take that on board as well the answer is always no until you ask for the sale and I see this all the time on bootcamp I see a student there and my assistants can attest to this it's quite frustrating when we're out there and you see this guy he's doing super well the girls laughing super into him touching them the friends like him etcetera it's like all systems go and then he just he fumbles the inches from the end zone if you will he just doesn't he doesn't close why well the answer is very simple he was afraid of rejection right it's going well if I try to escalate it might stop going well guys understand this on a logical level but it's not until you understand on a deep intrinsic level that you're gonna make the change but number one rejection does not harm you it does not harm you in any meaningful way right in any quantifiable way that's going to have a quantifiable effect on your day-to-day existence outside of that environment you know what I'm saying so you know it might wound your ego and I get it again you can know this on a logical level but you have often decades of social conditioning that is paralyzing you from taking that action but again you've got to practice this until it becomes second nature you've got to get to a point where you have that emotional leverage and I've talked about this many many times in different videos it's like a guy cannot get that emotional leverage to actually start taking the action and start going for clothes consistently until he's seen those those polls and those opportunities slip through his fingers like so many sands through the hourglass again and again and again and again where it doesn't it goes from being this theoretical pain of maybe I'll get rejected to this very real pain of seeing these girls that he that he had such a great connection with just leave time and time again because he didn't take the proper action a big thing to understand is this the girl isn't rejecting you she's rejecting the approach right and that's something I'm always telling the clients I'm always telling the students they're not rejecting you per se they're rejecting your approach and this is a good thing because it means that you can change it it's something that's within the locus of your control right it's within the realm of things you can control now granted look I get it sometimes a girl is gonna price you out for whatever whatever reason bad logistics maybe you're just like the complete opposite of her type there's like so many elements of randomness that can't be accounted for but those things are under your control what isn't order your control is the approach and once you understand you can start to look at hmm what might I have done differently to garner a different outcome and again that's very heartening to me because that's how I learned that's when you begin to learn and you start to refine so you can really maximize the odds in your favor people they they buy if you will when they feel that they're in control of the decision how do you do that well number one you literally ask for permission and also you give them choices as opposed to like a hard yes/no these are very basic sales tactics I'll often say let's do this like we're doing it together so you've got to be very decisive about it you've got to be very confident about it as well I've actually made it very explicit when I pull again there's ways to do it to finesse it obviously and these are the ways you're gonna have to find out your languaging different language patterns come into play I mean I'm not gonna say like hey do you want to go back to my house to fuck right I'm also going to baby steps the pole giving him choices do you want to do a X or Y and then making it very explicit that again this is the pulse so she when she says yes she knows what she's getting into another thing too if you've tried it four times and she's still kind of like on the fence you can even throw down an ultimatum but here's the thing don't play with an ultimatum unless again you're really willing to walk member four times rule I had many many cases where the girl just wasn't ready to go yet so I want to end this video with the idea that I really think gets to the bottom the heart the crux of this issue and that's this if you believe in your heart and it's a good idea for the girl to hook up with you then you are obligated to ask for the sale you are obligated to try to take it to the next level you're obligated to go for the close right it's literally the honorable thing to do to give her that opportunity to hop on it and enhance her life if you're going to be able to ask for the clothes strongly you need to believe that you're actually worthy of the clothes if you think your product is garbage they're gonna be able to sense that and they're gonna be way less likely to actually pull the trigger and go for it people can sense if you're not confident about the product and in this case the product is you so you got to get to a place where you feel you're actually worthy of the girl and if that means working on yourself but that means following your path that means being the man that you know that you were meant to be whatever that is figuring out that means living up to your values so that's really the key beyond all the little tricks and the little tactics you got to get right with yourself and believe that you're worthy of that clothes before you can actually start to close more and more consistently and once you get to that point though that's when you're gonna start to have a lot more success and ultimately asking for the sale it's the honorable thing to do because that's when you take that risk and you acknowledge that at the end of the day it is the girls decision whether or not to hook up with you anyway hope this been a helpful video for you it's been Jeffy and I'll see you next time we're very free how we can jump from topic to topic I'm topic to topic hey hey because obviously you're out of your goddamn mind we don't really put a lot of pressure on ourselves yeah this is not the the new method right in fact the less sense it makes the better lalala lalala lalala hey doom boys anybody here want to suck [Music],vsdu1OlYTCI
"I'd like to share something very special with you that happened two nights ago I was out on a romantic date and I met the woman we went back to my home and as I was preparing her a cocktail we she began to peruse my bookshelves as you know people often do when they're entering in your home for the first time and she pulls out a book and she says what the fuck is this and she finds this it's called full house Michelle how to be cool and I was like oh I remember this uh I purchased this one afternoon probably in like the late 90s or early 2000s while I was in the supermarket checkout line it's one of those like you know they have it up there with the tabloids and I was probably high and so I and I also want to be cool so I purchased it now so she began to kind of flip through it and she noticed that I have taken extensive highlighting to the book and this was probably done you know well before I got into this whole like game pickup what have you and so I thought it'd be interesting to kind of review it here with you today and go through my annotations and see what important lessons can be gleaned from this piece of Americana so um here it clearly says Jeff's book so you know it's mine so here's it starts off with a note from Michelle hi I'm Michelle tanner I'm nine years old and you won't believe what the kids at school wrote about me and their slam book they all think I'm boring but wait it gets worse I found out my whole family thinks I'm boring too there's my dad my two older sisters deej and Stephanie my mom died when I was little so Uncle Jesse moved in to help so did Joey he's my dad's friend from college and I have to show them all that I'm not boring and I'm going to prove that I know how to be cool so the book opens up we're going to do like a short I mean it's only fucking eighty pages in like 22.5 but you know what is kind of slam through it so first she goes to school she reads the slam book and it indicates her classmates find her boring and this disturbs her because you know who wants to be boring except Todd right so I that's his USP that's his Hugh Niq selling point okay so this value proposition is you don't have to be some kind of fucking lunatic to be good at getting girls so she's boring as hell and then she goes home Stephanie gives her a magazine called young sass and she looks at it and it says here yes the models were so cool-looking they made Michelle want to look just like them now to me this really speaks to the phenomenon of social conditioning and you know upholding unrealistic standards of what it means to be attractive now I think you know every day how many guys here read the forum there's a lot of butthurt whinging on there right about about what I'm Asian I'm Indian I'm short I'm old I'm bald I'm this I'm that so on and so forth eat a dick okay in fact eat a bag of dicks have the whole bag but again it's difficult to blame these people the reason I dislike it so much is because it's just endlessly cuz you know with the pickup community I think you have about a six month to a year turnover of fresh people coming in you know come on dude this shit's like basically it should spur session proof everyone wants to get pussy right so new people are constant coming in so a lot of these people haven't familiarized themselves with a lot of the concepts yet and the idea being that you know look yes no one's trying to disavow that women like a hot dude okay but if there's nothing you could do about it shut the fuck up and take action right I believe Tyler has an acronym about this you guys know what Tyler's Ackerman WI ns you know what that is max you know what that is wins and what is the acronym Stanford what's it work out take care of your image your basic Bachelor grooming nutrition and shut the fuck up workout image nutrition then shut the fuck up but again you know growing up we're we're given these images and it's it's it's hard for that's one of the first Hills I think that people have to overcome when they're getting into this is saying you know what I'm going to forge my own path I'm going to fucking do it my way and I'm going to make this shit fucking happen now of course what tends to happen is when you do try to elevate yourself up the Australians have a term for this the tall poppy gets cut you ever heard of that crabs in a bucket mentality etc etc etc so a lot of times when you actually take pains to I mean if you guys know what beta shaming is you ever seen the Tyler video on that basically there's this one video where he goes out and he's with a student and he has the student go up to the girl and say something to the effect it's kind of crass whatever he says I forget exactly little was it's like damn girl your ass or something absurd but like and the girls like how dare you fucking say that shit to me ridiculous you don't go talking like that that's absurd you need to change your approach yada yada yada yada yada Tyler goes up in in the next clip and he says basically the essentially the exact same thing to another the same girl in fact actually and she starts laughing and thinks he's awesome because again Tyler's internalized the belief systems and the so-called inner game that's going to allow him to pull something off like that and and get away with it quote-unquote although I feel that's pretty pretty terrible mentality I have like going to stop getting away with things but what's the reason because she can tell this other guy isn't quite there yet he's not actually a confident person he is emulating the behaviors of someone who would actually be confident so they get slapped down right so again Michelle's encountering this at a very young age as she looks through young sass Chapter three begins with her father cried Michelle's mother died Michelle's mother died says it twice she it's getting dark up in full house real dark now again a lot of times people are not everyone is coming from a place of sweetness and light in their upbringing I know I certainly wasn't and for many guys getting into this I know Tyler wasn't I was a bit of a fucking nutcase we were fucking psychos back then you know we weren't well-adjusted people I'd say these days people come into her a lot more well-adjusted like I only see one person with blue hair in here tonight whereas like 12 years ago you know we'd have like I decided like snakeskin pants on or some shit a mesh shirt the pink suit you know I put on the pink suit the other night actually after I fucked the girl who found this book so she wanted to see it but anyway so so tries on some fucking wack clothing and deej says it doesn't seem to be you and Michelle says that's great I don't want to be me how many people in here I've ever felt like they don't want to be themselves I certainly did why because what I was doing wasn't fucking working to achieve my life goals it's okay to adopt a different persona a lot of the time when you're first getting into this it can actually help you I mean how many guys in here have a jolly pirate nickname that they use on the internet forums I know you like half these motherfuckers do right here this is like the most disturbing crew in like San Francisco right here these guys yes they are single-handedly terrorizing the downtown Powell BART station it's going to be the next the next Eaton square  right so so anyway she goes to school and some ho looks at her clothes and says I like them Mandy said they're pretty weird but sort of cool now the lesson here is weird can be cool and in fact you may even want to embrace the weirdness in order to arrive at a place of coolness now look I remember back in the day like I we have saying in our SD it's called feature what you can't fix right so basically comes back down to his authenticity if you can't if you look a certain way if you're into certain things that might be considered dorky play them up moving right along the next highlighter highlighted area here since I'm writing about penguins I love the way they walk that's that was it I don't know what I thought about that but um  Michelle studied her new hair in the bathroom mirrors at school it turned out great she thought and she did she dyes her hair blue but her stomach gave a little flip-flop what if I'm wrong what if everyone hates what I did to my hair she thought what if everyone laughs no young SAS said it was cool Michelle reminded herself so it was cool well whatever it takes for Michelle to convince herself that her fucking hair is cool god bless her okay so then she goes to her old friend one of her like boring friends who says you don't even look like yourself just I know isn't it great so the transformation has begun and she's begun to alienate her old friends now this is an important lesson as well because a lot of times you know when you get involved in this people who knew you before will notice you trying to adopt new unfamiliar behavior patterns right maybe trying to step up more maybe interjecting into conversations more maybe speaking louder maybe just changing the tone al your voice may be taking charge during the conversation in the direction you want it to go and again if they're accustomed to you behaving a different way a lot of times they're gonna they're gonna react violently to this like probably not physically violently get new friends but like emotionally violently they will not respond well to it now the thing about this it's like look I I maintain it's it's important to have a peer group of like-minded individuals we're going to be support your goals right and this is why things like RSD and being here in this room can help if you haven't met people in the community this is like a good place to start you know the inner circle I know here is getting it's ramping up to do a lot of they go out quite a bit there's some very very dedicated and you know involved in that but you know I remember shit you just got to take it in stride man I used to go out and I would go out with like my chode roommates cuz no one else would go out with me and they would just go out and I you know we'd sit and drink in the corner and then I go off and do approaches cold approach and they kind of just chuckle and laugh to be like oh ho there he goes with this little his little pickup hahaha I get blown out or whatever I could come back to them you know it's like look don't take yourself too fucking seriously but the thing is if if they're not going to like the reason what is the reason that the friends are not typically going to respond so well to that it's not even jealousy a lot of people assume it's a jealousy thing I dare say that they're afraid that they're going to lose you right that you're going to move on and you're going to leave them to the dust this is something that Tyler talks about quite a bit as he gets older and he grows more accomplished he simply can't hang out with people who are on a lower wavelength anymore right you have to be very selective about who you spend your time with because again it whether it's your girlfriend someone you're in relationship with whether it's your family members whether it's your friends if they're trying to poison drip you as Tyler likes to call it which means that they're constantly feeding you a stream of poison attempting you to dissuade you from achieving your goals you can't permit that right you know like the classic example would be like if you have your girlfriend and you know you want to go out and you got to go you got to go somewhere you've got an important business deal let's say make a million dollar deal and she's like no just stay and why didn't you stand I got this it's my day off to do today if you Renea and like stay home and then you don't make the fucking million dollar deal she's gonna leave your fucking ass she wants you to be in this instance I'm not saying everyone's like this but in that particular instance she wants you to remain a fat fucking loser don't go to the gym don't make don't do work to increase your business don't trim your fucking nose hairs have them dangling out of your nose like fucking Tarzan okay but there's a friend of ours this really cool dude he has literally nose hairs dangling out of his fucking nose they look like dreadlocks coming out his fucking nose and I'm like yo what's going on dude like you got to get rid of this shit I told his wife she's like no I like the nose here like the fucking nose hair okay so when it would be careful of that now a couple of 5th grade girls walked by they didn't say anything to Michelle and they didn't stare but Michelle could tell they noticed her as soon as they pass by I shared one of them whisper awesome they know what cool is Michelle thought now when you are out peacocking and by the way I know peacock is a bit of a corny old term okay it's kind of corny it's kind of stupid a lot of the shit we used to do was like really off the fucking wall but again I would say experiment around with that shit for yourself okay the sash what is that the sash is peacocking what makes the sash work is there some inherent magical power in the sash well perhaps so since I wanted an honorable combat only the worthy may put it on by the way much like Thor's hammer Joel nur only the worthy made on the sash if you try to put that shit on and you're not down it's a negative five all right because what makes peacocking work the attention in and of itself is not what makes the phenomenon work it's your response to the attention that is put upon you I remember back in the day if I wore that fucking pink suit if I went out and I was like in a good mood like I was in state whatever you want to call it as having a good night people would be like damn son look at that suit looking sharp dude what's up man I got a picture with it like etc etc they be loving it on the other hand if I went on it was kind of like in a more of a down state you know is it anxious self-conscious not doing well complete opposite effect look at this fucking idiot haha nice - dude like even throwing shit like it's a complete 180 so again it's how you are able to handle the social pressure that's being put upon you right so bear that in mind I'd say go out where some fucking wack hat in fact you know this is for a lot of students just that I love that sash so I can roll in my pocket Sperry space-efficient and I can unfurl it and throw it on the dude and I had this like Indian engineer a few weeks ago and he just couldn't handle it after about ten minutes he's like so may I please remove the sash may please remove the sash sir may I please remove the sash sir I was like yeah okay all right take it off take it off you know shit man it's like we didn't give him the booze guitar it felt so good to be cool I mean that's pretty self-explanatory anyone who's cool knows that um Michelle could feel bees crawling through her hair she could feel their little legs on her scalp get them off me she screeched bees bees bees in my hair she spun around Laureen and her friends were standing in the bleachers and they were laughing now this is very interesting because Michelle here she's now locked in an egoic sense of self that is contingent upon validation from others it's a sad state of affairs things will happen out there that you may not like maybe someone will call you a mean name they call you a mean name maybe we get kicked out of the fucking club maybe you see your ex-girlfriend maybe you come out of the restroom and the girl you were talking to is making out with some fucking backwards hat wearing bro dog and precedes to leave with him to his marina home then  you know caught it costs more to live in the mission than the fucking marina now what's going on anyway so you know any number of things could happen you get a text the cats sick and barf blah blah blah whatever so you really have to have the ability in that case to just kind of take a deep breath return to Center and move forward in a positive direction because it's so easy to just get into a headspace where something happens and now you're circling the drain of despair you're in a shame spiral into the night all right one of the things I feel that distinguishes guys who actually learn this stuff actively from guys so called naturals who didn't have to learn these these social skills is oftentimes if the natural is out and he has like I got a lot of natural friends a lot of times if they're out and something bad happens they really kind of just get into a funk and they can't get out of it you know they're like I'm gonna take my ball and go home screw you guys I'm going home right and they fuck off but learning this you really cultivate the ability you're just kind of like hmm great to just rev it the fuck back up and get yourself out of that so for me I mean I've had times where I you know again seen all kinds of horrible shit like you know ex-girlfriend with the new guy etc etc or just you know some really intense scenario and I oh she will go sit in the van I'll go sit in the van and cry for five minutes smoke a joint go back to the club and then it's all good again then I pulled because that's the great thing about this game to me in these you never know which one is going to pull have you heard Tyler say play it to the bitter fucking end all right what does that mean means on any given night if you're going out with the intention to get laid to hook up with someone you don't know who the person that you're going to pull is going to be it might be the girl that you talk to you at nine fucking thirty right I'd like some happy hour holdover or it could be the girl that you talk to on the street at 2:45 a.m. you really you literally never know I remember one time I was I was here it was New Year's Eve and I was out with my friend evil Jimmy and we were at the sea of Dreams thing you guys know what that is the big New Year's thing at the the concourse there took about 10,000 people there's like all these uh you know EDM groups there and stuff and the thing is everyone's so we're going around and in that situation everyone's on drugs right so it's basically like it's like a multiple hour Twilight Zone and literally all we're doing in Twilight Zone my approaches are very straightforward I'll basically do a hand of God I was feel like you you are amazing I love you who are you right like that smirk calm calm energy by the way I see a lot of guys going out they see the shit like these Julian videos what have you Tyler videos and Tyler's quite gangster you ever heard of beast mode that motherfuckers the real beast mode because he goes up and he's very very physical off the bat I'm not that physical right off the bat hardly at all it's not my personal style late at night it's kind of a run at gun scenario and for those of you who do have a more physically assertive upfront style like that this is when those guys tend to shine you know I had this one assistant his name was Gary and this dude he had probably some of the worst empathy I've ever seen in anyone except for maybe Diamond dog and yeah just like oblivious and he but the thing is he had balls fucking steel so this guy he would just go up you boom you boom and the only way that cuz he have no depth that was all he had not he had balls but that's it ball big balls no brain no heart so balls of steel so he would just do this fucking gorilla game you know like you c'mere bro and at the twilight zone he would find a girl you know from time to time with you know relative frequency who would be like yeah okay you know so he would you just pull these do these Twilight Zone poles and I told him as I look Gary you know I think I feel it's important that you cultivate more depth so I'm hereby forbidding you from doing a same night pull from the club until you get a number from a girl call her up go on an actual date with her and have sex with her from the date well he didn't get laid for like 7:00 after this so I probably shouldn't tell that but I think ultimately you know it did for some - to look at least look at that area because again look I find the guys come into this game with two different issues either they don't have enough balls or they have too much balls right and it's difficult to teach balls balls must be cultivated right it's hard to teach balls it you could teach something to dial it back a little a little easier in some cases but then you have to teach them empathy - that is many cases people the overlooked key to the whole fucking deal right I don't care what people think about me but I'm keenly concerned about how I am making them feel on a moment-to-moment basis I'm not just standing there blithely saying shit thinking I'm awesome ok even though it may seem that way I do have a demonstrable attunement to their subjective emotional experience as I like to say I'm not just looking at her as a meat sock to jack off into right and in fact I'll actually say this I'll actually say that whole thing like see because again I kind of can come off like very arrogant and kind of like full of myself right so I'll temper this with self deprecation to show that it's tongue-in-cheek I don't actually believe this about myself although maybe I do I don't know I become such a caricature myself that I can no longer tell the difference between what's real and what's not and moreover I feel that this distinction is no longer meaningful in any real way so you know there's that but but the fact the matter is this so that like I said in the twilight zone I just go you I do hand of God I've written in so I'm at this this New Year's Eve thing and I'm doing it and like literally there's a lot of under like you know teenagers there a lot of like drug addicts and like so I grab them and I go basically go for a media makeout and you know some do it and like others are gross get away run away whatever whatever one girl she even starts making out with me and this girl's like covered in sweat or water or something I don't know Todd like yeah damn this is awesome and then she kinda just goes like this she's like making out fully and then she goes like this she's like and just like I'm a gay what the fuck come here she's like they're her serve like herping and derping about and so this goes on for like hours hours I missing 40 50 approaches usually I go out dude motherfucker I've been doing this shit for 12 years I can go out there and sit on Instagram for two hours and then be like okay I guess I want to go live now hey hey how's it going good evening did it have a reasonable chance of getting laid that night you know I don't do 40 sets of fucking die I do like five you know five sets a night maybe maybe more if I'm going crazy but that's about it so this night I did like 40 and I'm like dude I turn to evil evil Jimmy I'm like dude I don't know what the fuck's going on here dude I mean to say it I mean I'm getting a little discouraged here and evil Jimmy he looks he's like man what's that shit you always say open the present but what she doesn't know any of the shitty like he must a humor talking about be present I'm like oh be present oh okay I said yeah man that do that act like a black guy that's evil Jimmy his sage advice act like a black guy open the present so I'm like okay okay so I do it again and now by this time it's like 4:20 in the morning 4:20 it's like 420 4:30 in the morning I see this girl walk when she's dressed like an angel literally like an angel and I'm like you you're amazing I love you boom and it's just like beam on pull done it only took five fucking hours and fifty fucking approaches so again the lesson there is don't just throw in the towel call it a night at the first sign the first setback the first hint of it not going perfectly that's another big thing I see two guys get into this game and they you know they have what we call premature ejaculation all right I just student last week and do in the shit he'd go in and literally the second that it's not going completely perfectly he just bounces right I'll stick in there I'll try different angles I'll try different tacks I'll change up my my style I'll like change them I'll flush with my speech patterns I'll do all kinds of different shit self deprecated bit see what works see if something's going to stick Julian you've seen Julian's latest video not the most recent one but the one before that where he's talking about the pro versus the amateur the pro goes out and he literally thinks what it what am I doing here what the fuck am I doing here what am I trying to work on tonight you know because the game has a lot of different parallel focuses and you have to except you're not going to be able to focus on all of them at once right you might be trying to escalate physically in a smooth way that doesn't make people uncomfortable you might be trying to push your humor to be a little more cocky and as you do these things obviously you're going to fuck up but if you're just trying to go out and like do this mass fucking shotgun approach and like get it all better at once right like the full body workout the full body game workout well you might as well just be doing full body fucking curls in the squat rack motherfucker insofar as games concerned so I see a lot of guys and they're going on they're just mindlessly doing things but look one of the big things and I think that this one makes boot camp effective this is what makes the immersion program at Vegas that we have running so effective makes it even this is something like summit so effective end of the night everybody is thinking about what they did and they're discussing it these debriefs are very very important because again it lets you see the movie twice I think a lot of times people just go out they don't think about what their night was like but always be asking yourself the end of a night what did I do well what could I have done differently in X Y situation I used to write field reports right because I was a writer that's why I wrote the fucking field reports this is an outlet for my writing but within a day or two of going out every single night I would write a detailed story about what happened and this forced me to think and recollect what had happened and I think I you know I in large part what it should be might a lot of my success to that now that's a bit of a lost art I know right because you know who has time for that shit unless you like compelled to do so but I know that when these dudes go out the inner circle here you know they're breaking down each other's stuff they're breaking down each other's night because a lot of times even if you have the best of intentions to put yourself on the cross and be honest about where you're fucking shit up you're going to have blind spots okay you're going to have blind spots that your friends are going to be able to look at so trust your friends when they're telling you shit about your game don't just be like dead na yeah yeah yeah I know better and Blom off yeah you're trying to elevate your game dry spells and you try to work on your game yourselves me is it better to I mean that sounds like a really personal decision you might want to consult your clergyman I don't know what faith you are but uh I mean the thing about these so-called dry spells I'd say it look fuck who you want to fuck man you know if you get your dick hard fucker who gives a shit I think it's important a lot of times just it's just to build reference experiences to furthermore when you're talking about these dry spells you got understand I know when you're like on the path itself and you get like a two-month dry spell it seems catastrophic it seems as though your world is crashing down around you and it's quite horrific right but you really got a look at the big picture you don't want to be like focused in myopic looking at the peaks and valleys up close really you want to like take a long view of it and so it really even though like up close you see those peaks and valleys from far away it looks more like just a kind of a steady incremental improvement but again you have to be intelligent about your growth that's a big thing when I'm out I'm like I'm not like out there just like there's some Terminator looking for pussy okay I'm not like you're done - done - dun dun dun dun dun da dun dun donut pussy right like I'm out there to be a social person I genuinely enjoy I'm like usually genuinely happy to meet people talk to them find out about them again it's part of the process I think of just putting out a vibe of a naturally attractive cool social person",w2G7Cp-dgag
yo yo yo what's up its your proverbial boy Jeffy bat once more with yet another edition of Jeffy reacts and today we're going to a gold mine we're going back to the well of expert village and today's clip is how to pick up a girl in a bar how to flirt with a girl let's dive right into it shall we  it's kind of weird hi this is Alex MacRae I'm a social dynamics instructor okay let's make an important distinction here he is a social dynamics instructor but not a real social dynamics instructor and on behalf of expertvillage.com today i'm talking about picking up women in bars and clubs flirting what is it the basics of flirting is to convey through certain ideas and emotions that you like someone else and hopefully that the other person likes you back now who are the best florists in the world they're actually little kids now why is that well for one thing they have the best imaginations if they're playing in the sandbox and they're talking about some fantastic place that they can go in the world they're using their minds to put themselves in a place that's just the two of them in their own special world using their imagination also little kids are fearless they realize at such a young age that they have nothing to lose they're comfortable with themselves they're willing to take things to the extreme and be comfortable using their own imagination ok so children are the best flirts at first glance might seem like alex is on some kind of to catch a predator shit here you know Chris Hansen's going to come in and be like please have a seat over there why are you here were you attempting to fuck this young boy etc etc but he does have a point I think what the point is trying to make is that when you're going out to pick up girls you know at the club wherever the case may be you almost do want to revert to kind of like a childlike state in many ways and what do I mean by that well most people that you see out of the club are trying out there for what they're there to party they're there to have a good time they're trying to unwind from their stressful workweek and that's the vast majority of people then you have the subset of people who are in there and they're very anxious they're very in their head they're very logical and these people are people trying to pick up or people trying to learn pick up because rather than free flowing being in the moment enjoying themselves they're thinking about what the next move is or thinking about you know they're thinking about where's my value relative to hers how am I to go in what's the angle of approach what's my opener I hope she likes me all of this all this stuff and the number one rule of pickup what everything always comes back to you in my opinion and there's a lot of number one rules but in my opinion this is kind of the fundamental one is whatever you feel they feel so you know that law of emotional contagion and mirror neuron effect so you want to leverage this phenomena in your favor so again people are they're trying to have a good time if you go up nervous awkward anxious what's going to happen they're going to start to feel that way and there's going to be like get the fuck away from me so if you see myself out if you see Tyler out it looks like we're just like little little kids derping around like yeah oh yeah like having a fantastic time like saying ridiculous things like last week in Vegas during the World Summit I was telling women well it was like a two we had a two-man team doing this my buddy you would go up and he would talk to the girl he be like yeah I'm here with my friend he's actually a female-to-male transgender and this is his first weekend out you know presenting as a man he's kind of nervous about it you know so in fact that's him over there you know here I'll call him over don't say anything though right and so you Jeff and he calls me over and the girls like kind of looking at me weird like hello and then he's looking all like nervous and I'm like you told her didn't you he's like yeah like oh it's two and I talked this deep voice like oh it's totally cool yeah I've been off a bit of a hormones about 18 months you know I had the surgery and you know turned out pretty well like this is my first weekend now and almost nervous about how people would react and everyone's just been so welcoming and you know I feel really good about you know my beer came in really good and the girls are just like uh yeah because they don't know if I'm faking like well you really look like a man like you look like a natural man I'm like yeah you know even when I was a little girl I was a really fucking fugly little girl I just knew I just knew I was supposed to be a man and did they're like are you messing with me I'm like yes so anyway it ended early you know so again look at that you think that would be a good way to go about picking up a woman well in and of itself it's not it's but it's fucking ridiculous and borderline offensive but um but but again we're just playing around and that's that's the thing what most people as alex says you're when you're a little kid you have no problem adopting these ridiculous scenarios and saying things that might be potentially embarrassing order or ridiculous or just stupid but what happens is once you get into the public educational system you get to kindergarten then you start to get bought you saddled bombarded with what social pressure social conditioning from again your teachers your peer group your parents the media etc etc etc until you get to be an adult and now you no longer have that freedom to go up and say whatever you want and who cares if people think I'm an idiot it just spread the fun and not be so concerned about do people think I'm cool right that what we call that little me right so again tell them I say the the endgame the outcome of social conditioning it when you're an adult from all these years of conditioning is that again you go out and you can't just be expansive you can't be an expansive fun energy because there's a part of you that's like everyone's looking at me like you you you you you if you come to the transformational hot seat you know we do a variety of exercises that simulate that social pressure to give you an idea of what it feels like when it's happening so you could recognize that and you can shake that off right so again if you're constantly concerned about do they like me do they like me this protective intent you're going to do what you're going to have steps to the girl right a half step means what you're not going to fully commit because on a certain level you're afraid of getting blown out and oddly enough paradoxically even this has a tendency to increase the likelihood of you being blown out because the girl is fucking confused you're stepping but you're stepping weaksauce you know and that's when the girls went by you make these little confusion hey hey and the girls kind of looks at you like a fly buzzing it just continues on so to get into that expansive energy you kind of almost do want to revert to a childlike mentality so you know I guess again Alex buddy you know you kind of got the gist of the idea about the way you presented it made you seem real fucking creepy we're not flirting with kids here okay so what else you got one of the keys to flirting is actually let the other person know through your voice and through smile that you are flirting because a lot of the things that adults say that are flirting can be taken the wrong way if you don't convey them with energy and fun in other words if I see a girl with blue eyes I might say wow your your eyes are like blueberries wait can I actually actually I'm kind of hungry can I I have what the fuck what the fuck your eyes look like a berry I want to eat your fucking eyes so now I don't say a pedophile is a fucking serial killer as well dude what the fuck bro no no no no okay I think he's missing the point of flirty now flirting is not just saying ridiculous fucking shit and teases that is not what flirting is the core of flirting is like he said it himself he's like to convey that you like her okay now me saying your eyes look like bloopers want to you that means I like you as a food item that I'm going to murder and consume like fucking Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs okay no even though it's like he's making it light-hearted with this vocal tone that's all flirting is flirting is very specifically telling her that you are interested in her romance tickly right you're telling the person you're interested in them romantically as opposed to platonically this is not a buddy-buddy friend relationship this is a potentially romantic relationship that I'm pursuing with you so to that and basically flirting is in saying anything that brings up the idea of you two being together as a fucking couple right it's anything that brings up the idea of you two being together even suggesting that it's not a good idea right what's the classic push-pull you and I wouldn't get along we just argue all the time and then we have like freaky makeup sex and I don't think I'm ready for one of those volatile relationships right now or maybe I am what are you doing Annie you're so confused so right it's something dumb like that but again like like I said when I flirt with a girl I'll start off very innocuous and I'll ramp it up from there so I'll say you know can I ask you a question we always hot or we you would like a nerd than you became hot really like the ugly duckling that transform into the glorious wand it's not what's fucking going on here Sarah huh anyway like it was a BAM and so the key too is I drop these flirtatious comments in and it's like my vibing the something I'm saying or the north the contra the normal critical conversation I'm having with her is like a river and then I drop in these little statements of intent these flirtatious comments and they go blink and they just get carried off so I'm like yeah blah blah blah just got Obamacare it's fucking the shit anyway what's your profession being hot no I'm a student what do you study being hot sorry so anyway like I was saying though so now my physician blah blah blah blah you know whatever so she's like you can't just fucking say I was hot so it's almost again like a subliminal hit again the last thing I want to do with flirtation is throw it out there like you're hot what do you think of that like looking for reaction again puts too much pressure on the girl so with flirtatious comments I want to start off innocently and that escalate I'm actually becomes more accustomed to them so then by the end I'm like I want to Eskimo kiss your pussy I want to finger you with my penis what you know whatever nonsense whatever nonsensical like explicit should I get into but again that's down the line start off innocent throw him in subliminally plow mud or move on right so again the big component of the flirtation that is missing here is the actual sexual attraction component don't get it twisted just making goofy comments the girl is not in and of itself flirting that's one thing that you could go into that is fun and will get a girl giggling within moments but now notice what happens if I don't smile if I bring my energy level lower and if I'm if my voice tone is flat hey I really like your eyes they're blue like blueberry's can I touch them can I have them I'm hungry it's just strange so remember to let people know that you're flirting have the big smile high energy and make sure you're having a good time if you're having a good time it's likely that you'll put other people around you in a good mood so how do you flirt one way to do it is through roleplay for example I might imagine that me and the girl I just met are actually husband and wife and we're negotiating a divorce so I can say babe you know I'm sorry I had to do this sorry I have to break this theory here but it's over you know you know ten years I had some good times but you know you can keep custody the kids um you can keep the house I'll keep the dog because you know buddy I trained buddy myself and you know he's a good dog so by now have a good life I'm sorry this whole divorce thing worked out this way see that's one thing that you can go into that's a little strange fun and it puts you in a situation that would take you years to get into in real life and you just met this girl so remember you can roleplay situations that are fun and unusual okay yeah that's not terrible I mean but the whole I mean it's a little corny that I mean but then again some of the best flirtatious shit is corny I mean I'll often do the prom dance you know I'll be like if I asked you to the prom would you go with me if I wear a tuxedo will I appear handsome it's time dance do a little dance with her I'm gonna be like yeah at the dancehall after the dance I'll attempt to fuck you in my dad's car and I'll pretty maturely ejaculate because I'm a fucking chode it'll be the most magical night ever right so anyway bow and then plow again but here the thing he's talking about it's like very boring it's not sexual yeah it's a married couple getting divorced I mean I guess it's good because it brought the idea of them being married in the first place but note how mine it takes it a little more edgy it's a little more sexual it's a little more up front now again your style may not be you may not be that comfortable saying I want to fuck you in my dad's car but again you could be like if I ask you the problem do you go with me and then do the dancer and then you're adding in a physical component as well right like a very natural playful and dynamic physical component to the escalation if you will as opposed to what like what most guys do they give the hand of the fucking arm that just sits there so with all my physicality it's again there's kind of a plotline to it and it has the same characteristics of starting out relatively innocent you know like a little finger grab or something like that and then ramping up to where it's getting a little bit more real right yeah like a little more heated as it progresses because again introducing it incrementally gives her time to either adjust to the idea so she doesn't like freak the fuck out when you try to grab her now read it some girls if you have a good vibe right off the bat it may be appropriate to just go in for the kiss right away right sometimes you lock eyes with the girl and you just know it's on and you know it's kind of like a lightning strike however it you know it no its importance to I guess be aware and cognizant of when that's happening so you can take advantage of it but as a rule of thumb again generally I want to start up relatively slow and then Ratchet it up incremental II giving her not only time to acclimate to it but if I do want to do that by doo-doo-doo-doo one of those things great sense of humor Jeff if I do one of those things and she doesn't really kind of like she's not feeling it then I can kind of back off drop a little statement empathy and then move on again right so if I do like a really hard physical escalation and she doesn't like it I might be blowing the fuck out but if I do it incrementally she doesn't like it I'd back off again drop that statement of empathy it might even help because she saw that I had the presence of mind and I'm paying attention to her enough as a human being to pick up when she's giving those sort of like not quite yet signals that yellow light signals back off and you know I'm not just in my head like thinking I'm fucking awesome plowing ahead doing shit because again I think one of the biggest missing pieces to a lot of guys game is that empathetic that empathetic side of the game right back where they connect with the girl line right there there's throwing out taxes they're throwing out physicality throwing out lines etc etc and they're just hoping something's going to stick without paying attention to that critical element of the emotional connection where again that our emotional acuity rather where you can see how she's reacting and respond accordingly balancing on it almost like a wave all the way to shore and by sure I mean pussy another way to do things is take things to the extreme yes to the extreme rock the mic like a vandal light up the stage and wax a chump like a candle if I mention blueberry eyes I might just say that off the cuff but I'll take that to the stream of water fries actually were blueberry what if I was a chef what if I wanted to make a blueberry cake what if the blueberry cake won the World's Fair of being the best blueberry cake in the world it was all because of her eyes but now she has a medical condition because she doesn't have any eyes anymore because the blueberries and you can see how all these things can just build and build and build into funny situations that are quirky because they start from something so simple so remember have fun roleplay and remember the kid in you who's the great flirt thanks for watching yeah dude again I think and this was made this video in like 2007 so honestly a pickup had evolved to the point where there's really no excuse it's really no excuse Alex from expert village so the thing is I mean he's got some good points be free you know don't stifle yours don't allow that social condition you know so stifle you to the extent where you're in a protective intent and you can go out have an expansive energy share hype the party up but at the same time if you're just going out saying ridiculous shit you're going to look like what like an ass clown dancing monkey etc at all so again while it's very important to have that free flowing again expansive energy on the other hand you need to direct it you got to have that rudder and you got to direct it where you want to go which means what it means knowing what the waypoints are in an interaction and knowing how to lead them down that path where you are where you need to go and what are the steps to go that way so again you've got you've got that in turtle mindset dial but you also know the external strategies so if you're interested in learning more about this stuff check out my Jeffie hotseat transformational experience which I'm relaunching in two weeks from now and with you know I know when when Tyler came out with the transformational experience last year I saw what he was doing and I was like I saw a lot of these exercises and I was like okay uh we're officially a cult now because I saw like these diet guys like jumping around acting insane and I really wasn't on board until I attended a couple of myself and I saw what he was doing with that shit and I finally understood what the point of it was and the point of it is this because we're very good we are see has been around for 13 years and we're very good at teaching technique and strategy but what I noticed is even with all of that a guy can understand intellectually every single technique that we've put out he can even recite the things that we say verbatim but a lot of times these guys still aren't getting the results that we get in fact on bootcamp a lot of the time the students will comment like it even look like you're doing anything because I can go up and say hey how's it going where do you live where are you from you know boring interview style questions and make it work and the reason for that is because we're hitting what's called the sweet spot of the techniques right a guy like I said he can't emulate a technique that he sees myself for Tyler due to the letter but in unless he understands the nuances involved and the principle behind that particular tactic that makes it work quote unquote he's never going to be able to make it work properly because hitting that sweet spot means you know exactly how much to open up the throttle know when to back off and again like I said that only comes from understanding the principles and so the exercises in the transformational experience are designed specifically to ingrain those principles into you and another thing and this is more important a lot of times even if the guys understand those principles they're not able to execute why like for example I'll tell a guy on bootcamp a pillow he'll come back and he'll do something and I'll see it was incorrect you know whatever it is and I'll say okay man so next time that was pretty good but you did this wrong next time go and do this instead and he'll go I might do you understand he's like yes I understand and then he goes in just the same dumb shit and I'm like this guy's not stupid why isn't he able to execute this and the reason it's quite simple he's got emotional blocks that are preventing him from executing so the thing is yeah rst were great at teaching the techniques were great at teaching the strategies but unless we're able to remove those emotional blocks and internalize those principles it's not going to matter you can know every technique in the world and you're still not going to have success because there's going to be stat that repression is just going to be stacked on top of it so with these new exercises in the Jeffie transformational experience these are designed to help strip away that social conditioning now obviously in a period of several hours that's not going to happen we're talking about a lifetime of conditioning here but we can definitely plant the seeds so you can leave that program you can execute that night what you can in over the next couple weeks go into an upward spiral where you start to shake off that social conditioning a social pressure that's putting you box so you're able to execute okay additionally I've got some very special exercises that are unique to the GMT transformational experience and these you know people always ask me Jeff how you know you're a pretty witty guy you're very funny guy how can i cultivate verbal wit and humor so i've developed specifically for my hot seat some very very cool exercises that are signed to help you build up that verbal witticism and help you build up here in how to be humorous and so you're going to be able to go out there and come up with your own jokes and come up your own stuff on the fly in real time as you interact with girls out in the field cool so anyway more about that a couple weeks when we relaunch and the rebranded Jeffie transformational hot seat experience so check it out and I'll see you next time I'm chef Irie axe,wYWU9zhCbI8
over time you learn to be more assertive you learn how to fucking flow freely if this isn't a process of adding it's a process of letting go you have to let go of needing it to work you have to let go of hoping it's cool you need to let go let go let go and by the way with this whole idea of vibing what's vibing vibing is a non goal oriented conversation that's designed to what pump your and her emotional scene that's it contribute to that cascade of positive emotions right that's it with vibing there's a couple things you want to bear in mind I see there are five belief systems you want to instill in yourself number one what I have to see is valuable because it comes from me right you ever watch our YouTube channels at all right you ever seen this shit where of me and evil Stifler just like Santa Claus Santa Conn mm-hmm so instead of the SantaCon whatever so we're out of this thing and the last thing of the of the video this girl walks by about she's about 20 feet away and I go my opener I go I go doll that's the opener Derr Derr there's not even a word it's like a a guttural noise I go oh and the girl was like that she goes she's walking by she goes and just walks 20 feet over I make out with her immediately [Music]  y'all come here tail woman I've seen you earlier on the street I said if wonder where that girl now is it because ders so awesome is it is dirty new awesome shit is that a dirt yeah dude is is that the new awesome shit does that impress you does he think I hope no obviously not what is it exactly number one I believe its value because it comes from me number two I have faith that people are gonna find it interesting because of curiosity 3 I lower the bar for how good it has to be that's huge lower the bar for how good it has to be you know just don't need to be louis c.k this don't need to be fucking Chris Rock this doesn't even fucking Noam Chomsky or some shit like whatever for stay it be in the moment don't think ahead stay in the moment because otherwise you're not gonna be able to focus on what she's giving you emotionally and five perhaps most importantly it's not what you say it's the energy behind it this is why I can tell some fucking story about taking the fucking trash out and have it be compelling I mean this literally happened to me last night I came home from the club and I saw all the neighbors had their trash out and our trash wasn't out I guess what bitch I was in fucking lost in the previous week and the fucking idiotic fucking roommates didn't take the fucking trash out and you know what happens you don't take the trash out maggots you know happens to give maggots belies disgusting these fucking morons I was like enough of this fucking shit time to take matters into my own hands bitch I ain't happening again I can't even go and do my laundry without putting a fucking thing over my face it smells like ass so I open the fucking garage door I pulled out the black bin I pulled out the recycling bin and I live in San Francisco California which you're required by law to compost so I have to pull out a green bin too after I do all of this I look at it  close the garage door and that is how I took out the motherfucking trash y'all stupid story oddly compelling by virtue of the enthusiasm which atone so again with that ho at the fucking bar there I wasn't saying jack shit I was like teach we had to speak Boston pasty pasty me lay like just seen nonces gibberish I don't give a fuck the thing is again you you're a lot you're you're you're you're believing that it has to be awesome just shake that magic 8-ball just shake it up whatever comes to the surface you throw out trust in your faculties okay why is the girl gonna be interested in it why is the girl gonna be interested in why does she want to be part of it what is it what does that mean and what does that ultimately mean she wants you to place your penis inside of her pussy  every girl I talk to I have the belief that she wants to fuck me is it delusional perhaps but guess what until I discover otherwise I'm operating under that assumption again you're like please like me enough to let me fuck you will you let me fuck you will you let me fuck you this can't be adversarial it's got to be win-win completely win-win it's got to be a win-win it's not you versus her it's us together you know say so but you know you're getting you're good you're good I just you know I'm just giving you shit obviously because this is the this is the whole purpose of this purpose,wdipRFDlzOk
all right all right welcome to the wonderful 2017 rst Winter summit I'm Jeff and I'll be your first motherfucker today probably a lot of you have attended rst programs before how many guys like going to boot camp before some other kind of artistic programs period yeah and I think that the value of the sum is it's in you know coming together with like-minded people who view this area of study this endeavor if you will as something that's you know worthwhile something that's actually beneficial to your life and when you come off a boot camp or something like that you usually like very gung-ho you know you're fucking fired up you're like shit man I'm gonna grab this shit by the balls I'm gonna you know go and you know just do it you get back home and maybe you have like you know boot camp I for a couple weeks we were like raging to go but then of course what happens you've got old disempowering anchors like the assholes from your work and your fucking family members being a dickhead and your friends trying to bring you down and telling you this and that and so on and so forth and it's just it just kind of like it sort of Peters out right you know so coming to these it can be like very cool to just kind of recharge your batteries so you're good for the next six months and say you know what I mean so you go back you hit the ground running back home you're charged up to like do this shit even more let's just open it up and I kind of wanted likes here what's on your mind what do you guys like yeah you know what are some of your goals for this week in fact let's just do that because I always what I like to do for winter summit and you know the Vegas summit what I like to do is I take these as times to take stock of what my goals we're not just in pickup but also like Fitness finances life etc so and then at each summit I can meet with the guys you know the instructor team and we sort of go over that stuff and see where we're at so who has any like crazy goals for this week they want to accomplish in the course this week threesome you want to have a yeah [Music]  where where was that where did you pull the threesome in that room just be cool dude why can't you just be fucking cool like me so you've never had one before god bless god bless you well this this is interesting because um you know I say this I say this a lot and if you never have one before you probably now your eyes are open to a new level of existence beyond that which you ever imagined possible and you know a lot of people say you know threesomes pretty good but but you know they I they all right none that these people are incorrect it's actually fucking awesome what I say like driving to sports cars at the same time if you can somehow likes like straddle them and shit right what was the how did it go yeah like what was your technique we did it just kind of like you see it organically heck yeah  they went responding gregarious initially just meet people girl all the hospital that work there she was off-duty you whatever she wasn't working so we're hanging out I met these other girls these French girls I'm with end up going with them to go get burgers and stuff got back in the hospital at 5:00 awesome Peters at the liquor store I like Cher here's everybody and then there's music playing we're in the middle of beer garden and like I'm just dancing with this when it's girl and she she's fucking hot dancing and this other girl just walks up to her oh my god this is like in the club right well you know honestly like I wouldn't give yourself a little credit you know what I'm saying because a lot of guys that put that position they would like freak out or they would ball could not know what to do freeze up a little bit like uh but but again I think that story right there it really kind of illustrates the whole vibe of this this place right South Beach at least when I come here it just seems like most of the people are here in a similar vein to how things are in Vegas kind of it's just like party time many people are here on vacation and you just again all you really got to do is orchestrate it in a smooth way the best most succinct description of game I heard recently was this from an ex-student of mine he said this this what he said about game he's like look everybody's fucking bored give him something different to talk about and then make it easy for them to suck your dick and not feel guilty about it right I'll say it again everyone's fucking bored give them something different to talk about and then make it easy for them to suck your dick and not feel guilty about it right so when I say everyone's bored what do I mean by that everyone's coming up saying the same dumb shit and what does every guy going up and saying what's up what's your name what's up I'm bill your beautiful touch on the arm touched on the arm touched on the lower back right in fact it's kind of funny because my buddy uh sergeant sergeant Kyle here we were out in Boston a few weeks ago in earth a few months ago now and we're like you know what do you look tonight let's just try something different let try to do like chode game like straight road game and you know sometimes we'll dabble around and we'll do like old-school game night where we go up and we run the cube and we fucking you know peacock and all that shit but we want to do full show games so literally we go up to these girls we're just like hey so uh do you live here what's your name what do you do for work do you like it cool like with this like very flat effect and it was our thing is when we started doing this it was fucking working it was what it was working they're like you're fucking hilarious do this or making out with us and shit like what the fuck is going on here so why is that why is this working why do you think that was actually working right so they can again most guys when they're doing that the reason that they're doing it is because they don't know what the fuck else to do so they default to the interview style questions right so when they're asking these interview song questions they're asked they're like desperately fucking treading water hoping the interview questions don't run out like I hope the questions don't run out I hope the fucking questions don't run out why do you live what do you do oh right there's lip in the fuck out but with us when we're doing that again we don't have to do that so we can chill back and if we're doing that it's a proactive decision but the thing that I would say continuing on what I was saying there it's a note how when the opportunity presented itself what did he do he moved it moved it ahead see that's the thing you have to do you have to be able to orchestrate it especially here my people are down to fucking party but you got to have the wherewithal the balls the nerve to step up and make it fucking happen and sometimes be a little obnoxious about it what's like the shittiest Club here welcome to mangos we're all gonna end up of fuckin mangoes at one point this week at one point what everyone's gonna go through fucking mangoes one of you is gonna make out with a tranny mangoes and you're gonna pretend you didn't know but you knew you always know I never buy that I never bought that shit I didn't know you fucking knew no one cares don't give fuck shit just say it dude the adam2 the five o'clock shadow how were you able to tell the dick the giant dick but yeah you're all gonna member if I could know it wasn't mangoes at the other one Clevelander when telephones in Cleveland her and I saw there's these like these hot chicks there there's like ten hot chicks and they're sitting on like one of those little I know some little thing and they're crying I'm like what the fuck is this I roll up in like what's going on are you okay what's happening why are you crying shit and she's like it's my bachelorette party and we didn't get tickets anywhere so we had to go to Cleveland and they're crying because they had to go to Cleveland I mean I get it I sympathize I I feel the same but that's like a big thing I see with guys is that they're just not they're not willing to accept the fact that pickup communication is generally not logical right because people are accustomed to speaking in professional concise manner right so it's very important to kind of learn to detach from that logical headspace where things need to make fucking sense generally the less sense things make the better and this all contributes this sort of error of kind of like an ethereal dream it's a fucking dream it doesn't count things don't think bills mortgages fucking work these things don't exist be obnoxious be bold when you go for the pole do it decisively don't hem in hah that's a big thing guys well hem and a ha about the fucking Paul like so do you wanna maybe did the the did the like they're just fucking hem and haw ask you all these questions just fucking yank just fucking yank if it doesn't work stop laugh it off try again until they're gone or they go with you it's that simple right it's really that simple so the thing is though a lot of guys newer guys especially they they hope or dream I guess that the girl is going to orchestrate the pole for them the girl will never work a straight the pole for you almost never I mean and yes sometimes they will especially you know the older you know kind of over it like yeah fine let's go motherfucker let's do this right and they'll pull you but again it's certainly nothing you'd want to like rely on but many guys will whine and bitch about how you know unfair it is you know it's not fair that the onus is on us too fucking bad you know too fucking bad it's like you to ball pass the butter that's that ship will never it's not going to help you I'm gonna give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy/paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that completely automates the process to get me dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do this is execute the program version 2.0 the ruthlessly efficient highly repeatable system for the modern day online gangster it's over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of Eden filled footage broken-down case study and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you pull her that night I covered the exact repeatable pattern takes to take a girl home nearly 85 percent of the time she agrees to meet up with me this is my online masterpiece at bottom line - just plain works now you have a choice to make keep using the Internet to beat off or use it to have someone else beat it off for you so decide Oh fasten wanna start getting laid and execute the program [Music],wx_IsVkOrDI
I hope I don't say something untoward in this video because you know these days you know with the culture wars and so forth we could be at the center of yet another whirling gyre of atrocity and Shane it's ok I er I like that a gyre yeah that I believe the first time I encountered that word was in the works of Lewis Carroll or no fuck that my old steam the poem about the whirling gyre ok and the center being lost that's what's happening out it here's the deal it's me your proverbial boy once again here in Miami South Beach with my good friends the Australian max down a day from giannetta and Luke the notorious L I be I don't know what but it's notorious so yeah regardless he's notorious and what we want to talk to you about this evening as it were would be something that's kind of been near and dear to my heart something I see in a lot of my friends that's quite concerning and you know if you've tuned in in the past you know that I am a firm believer in self-reflection so whenever I see something that I notice my friends kind of kind of screwin up or kind of fucking up it doesn't make me judge them well it does but it also makes me think where am i doing that in my own life and specifically today what we're focusing on is people who consistently seem to get in bad relationships and what kind of fuels that you know what are the base reasons that you see these patterns emerging and so forth and you know what are the pitfalls you might want to avoid and just kind of telling some stories about some of the worst relationships we've ever seen and how you know in our opinions our esteemed I you know I guess educated opinions on these issues so you wants to go first got a story about some shit relationship what's like the worst relationship you've ever seen a cubby one you were in it could be one that you've seen your friends be in the the interests thing about it right is that for me that's for me and people that I see it's the longer that you're in a relationship the harder it is to get out so the ones that I see are the ones that are just like the biggest suck you suck you bus succubus is not like non-stop so yeah it's too much investment you always think I'm intertwine - yeah exactly but something that's the pair bonding thing right and it's just it's really fascinating to see guys who I mean by guys I mean myself a long time ago and guys that I see recently and it's it's really fascinating because everybody thinks that oh they can get out of it at any time and you're think you know I could stop whenever I want right and it's oftentimes like oh this behavior that the the woman did isn't so bad I need I was talking to somebody earlier today and they said they need a silver bullet meaning they don't want to end it unless something so severe that it's that like they can come back and write this girl is so it started out with this girl basically just warning him for money so that's always a great start and so then he started Eber eats seen her food like throughout the day when he was never with her I have a very simple rule which is when I'm basically the simple rule starts with this the red ships don't get better if the first 90 days of a relationship is struggle and strife and difficult it's not gonna all of a sudden eight months later just come this amazing thing obvious thing right the first part of the relationship the first couple of weeks that should be the most exciting and fun period and this woman is just basically not really having sex with him and then that brings up another rule if your stuff if yours if your I'm like you guys I guess we can't even fathom that manye thing like that they've the first time she's like like without like a reason like you know she's like I'm really sick but I have a fever 104 I can't have sex and I'm like oh shit maybe we should get you to the hospital you're done it's not even set or like a bad thing it's just because I mean at the end of the day I don't need an activity partner like like like this guy basically has this this friend that he pays for shit and then it's just this this weird dude who has another dude friend right imagine he's it's not a hop girl he's paying for just imagine it's his dude friend like hey James who's still not putting out yeah here's your food you know like how weird would that be I've seen that happen actually yeah it's just weird so then like the guy has value to other people so people work again but it's all it shouldn't be this like value exchange yeah like I'm gonna paint your uber e and you're gonna suck my balls yeah yeah again if I'm gonna pay the rates is because I want to genuinely and not like I'm this transactional experience yeah or at least if it's somewhat transactional then get the other part of the transaction I don't mind trans actually I actually don't mind trans actual experiences as long as cuz like anything is kind of value exchange right I'm like like as the guy yes you are the as Maxon earlier you're the warrior she isn't like I don't necessarily need the girls that I'm dating to like provide food or any sort of like those kinds of resources so that's why it becomes this weird transactional thing because what other resources they provide to the thing at a certain point like I have this one rule right I'm a very very simple rule it's fellating conversation exactly right provoking girls can come and get nice things but you can't give girls nice things you can't just give up you can't Boober eats her food or like go pay for a dinner for a girl and her friends when you're not at that dinner it's weird enough if you're just paying for everybody's thing when you were there but then to just kind of like send her out into the wild and right so he this is great yesterday he Eber eats her food and it was enough food for three people I mean the funniest part is it's like it's it's not exactly high-end food but it's enough quantity of food that I'm like yo bro she's clearly eating with somebody else it's like it's this type of food I'm just like she's like she's not reading this many chicken with fucking me with me motherfucker like here's it there's kind of a side note but I a side tangent if you will but it's gonna be brief I'll make it brief I wanted the weirdest date I've ever been on in a long time maybe ever like a weirdest tinder date well let's just put it like that so I met the girl went out had a good rapport with her but like in but it was more friendly but regardless I executed the program like you let's go back to my place I'll make you a drink just out of habit because you never know once you get back and like something happens Oh your mind chant you see her in a different light or something like that if she sees you know you the chemistry's there but no we got back and was just like super friendly which is cool so we're just like getting high and like oh yeah blah blah chitchat like I want Taco Bell my bitch there ain't no fucking Taco Bell it's like 1:00 in the morning so like there's the one on Bay Shore I'm like I'm not driving a bitch then post mates I'm like if you know what post mates is it's a special service basically essentially like slaves in San Francisco which is the bastion of white privilege fantasy land where you get anything - literally anything delivered to your door in like 20 minutes should you not so well fucking is not slaves well you know I mean it's an inequality of income inequality in San Francisco it's been a growing problem over the last two decades I've been there and witnessed or personally the like that's but that's not the topic of this fucking video that's not my my purview it's not my fucking can it's not my fucking forte okay right I stick to the goddamn pickup shit these days I dip my toe to like some political crap once and people fucking said you're a fucking they both said you're a fascist and you're you're a Lib tard cocks oh yeah at the same time so I'm not going there no more we're sticking to the pickup shit without that I do best okay but regardless so we get the Taco Bell I'm like what do you want like I want this that in this so you actually dry hose you postmates it like that what this way he's mid post me I paid for the pay posed me so it's not really germane to what this discussion is but it's too good I had to share it so so I'm like what do you watch like this isn't this I'm like that's like 1349 he's like it's not enough we're getting more and I like go down I'm like whatever it caught my interest I'm like nachos Bell Grande chick star I don't even know what the fuck that is we're like it sounds awesome I get that all this fuckin shit and I order 52 dollars of Taco Bell to the home the Taco Bell comes we consume it we eat it all then I'm like I'm like damn dude this shit's fucked I'm probably in the morning gonna feel like equally bad as if I had done like drugs and she says oh you want to do drugs yeah cuz we're all drunk and like yeah she's like I have ketamine I'm like oh my I don't do that ketamine shit unless that's like the veterinary kind that you do like intramuscular injections fucking leg okay I fuck with this like in handling SH a like no it's good it's really really good and I'm not sure look what does it do she's like makes you feel like you're in space am i cool so I like take a like a fat like motley crue chopper of it and and and she goes and she says welcome to the cables she's like yeah chatting and then like 30 minutes in I'm like whoa this isn't like some sedative thing like I'm tripping ball and I'm like in a puddle at one point I farted and it was like my talk will go far it was like a Goya painting you know the one where the guys are at the the firing squad like yeah it looked like a fucking go panting this blending of the reality and that was the note from the the experience and then so that finishes up didn't have sex or like kind of we made out a little bit it was like uninspired and bizarre because we're having a hallucinogenic experience like basically it's like an alien alien like so I'm supposed to do what like put myself inside of you like you know cool so let me ask you a question why do you bring ketamine on a first date just like I just always have it great time she leaves us to lead her number immediately but anyway sorry to hijack no I mean that is definitely an awkward bad relationship that's great I took but again it was yeah I mean it was an awkward bad there's a microcosmic relationship okay so why don't we I don't know listen because the thing is we could just sit here and bitch about like how much these guys suck and everything lol look at this fucking fag etc but that's not the point like with RSD we like to give solutions to your problems okay like constructive things and so how would you I don't know what do you think you're like the fundamental reasons that somebody gets into a relationship that's kind of like very transactional and even when they're not getting what they they bargained for they still stay in it like why what doesn't tality that causes someone to gravitate towards that and not only that stay in it you think I mean I mean people just want attention they just want to they wanted to do the least amount of effort and have the most amount of reward but the problems they don't know what that reward is so a lot of times these guys are our gaming or at least I found myself in the past - just being in the situations that I didn't really have a desired objective outcome people want to look at these relationships as what how it feels so often times they'll get into relationships that aren't good for them to kind of sit back and relax when in reality that's that's the one that's gonna be destined to fail  Matt and massive lack of strategic thought to the point where you haven't know about to agree that like a lot of times like people think these relationships are they're supposed to happen organically like that's a big part of the beef with the pickup industry is that like well it's not organic like it should just happen like in that one video where like Owen with the guy outside the bar in Seattle yeah hey man you should just smile at the girl like they literally believe that that's how the right relationship happened so yeah again do you think some of that is contributed to this I think it's definitely contributed I mean I think I think that's also the most asinine ludicrous thing ever to think that something's supposed to happen that organically you'll just happen to have you just happen to have everything in common this book - yeah and then it's always like it's being fed into us she's like a Romanian led from her war ridden country like and it's Refuge it's being like every love story is like some showed showed who's not good with girls but he really respects women and he really he really enjoys women not only for sex and he's just having a nice little virgin life and then the hot ten that has that is fed up with the douchebags that always fuck her she comes across him and she's like this guy is super hot he's gonna be my boyfriend and he has obviously no idea how to pass the simple shit just cuz he's never had a fucking girl and then and then that it's the perfect relationship skill exactly there's no skill involved Society Buford deserve Jesus as being Mac evil and manipulative of course exactly because they don't understand it's like the thing is like she said this is gonna be the most your significant other is going to that one of the most if not the most important relationship in your life especially if you're one of those people who you know is thinking towards family and long-term like relationships and things like that again if you know a how to comport yourself outside of relationship so you're not afraid of leaving it yeah you know aside from maybe the monetary hate you take from a divorce but but no that's a whole nother issue but but still like you're not staying with her out of scarcity that's gonna make you more present more more at a parity in terms of value in the relationship right better for relationship because you're more and more Center you're there because the power shift is different this is what I this is what I say law to do clients that are in relationships like the power shift is always the girl always has naturally more power because she's in her prime usually if she's a pretty girl and she has more options right now by you being fucking aware of what the fuck you're doing by you having game and actually coming with a certain structure you just you're not like manipulative patriarchy no you getting on the same fucking power lever now you're equal a girl always enters a relationship with more power because she has more abundance that's the thing - like your whole-- do you know 27 you're 27 I'm 42 I'm dating an extremely gorgeous 25 year old grows and medical school like like it's ridiculous for me to like again on so many levels under that those circumstances like she's at this college now granted it's like a graduate medical program so most of the people there are fucking dorks there's got to be a couple of chad's there but I'm not like oh shit these like 25 year old guys were all jacked and shit giving her cocaine well first of all she would never do this she did it in a dream once and it made her sick I mean and again like you say you're deluding yourself Jeff she's doing you know she's not fucking doing she's a fucking dork but again think about like that that not only she hot but like a fucking dork like this fucking angel why do you think I selected that person so not only are you gonna be like when you know game hopefully theoretically aren't you gonna be better in the relationship because of those like lack of scarcity / abundance reasons but also you've pre-selected that girl in such a way that you again you've had strategic foresight and forethought into the kind of girl that you want look dude I've always maintained you don't sleep with like a hundred hundreds of girls so you can just like fuck its shit ten a hot bitch is actually that's big reason but but there's like okay you know sort of an ancillary benefit which is that you know what you don't want you know what I mean so it behooves you to really start to think strategically about again if I'm gonna call a girl like my girlfriend like this is my fucking girlfriend and let me tell you the hierarchy here there's the girlfriend and like her she's a fucking princess she's awesome she's my best friend she's everything to me oh shit suddenly life has new meaning to me right that whole shit but then there's like FB s like friends with benefits but honestly at the end of the day they can be like I'm fucking walking chef I'll be like I'll miss ya you like straight up completely and then there's like the third tier like the you know the third tier of hell or what have you like I've Inferno where it's just like the fucking tinder realm in the fuck and the club poles like which again candies can always maybe like jump up a an energy level an electron level like hey but still you know that's what it is so if she's gonna be like that girl you better fucking bet your ass I'm gonna be very selective like look if you look at my last like and I said this to this buddy of mine it like if you look at my last like three or four girlfriends there's only one that was kind of nutty you know there was only one that was kind of nutty and even she had a good job she had a car like she's not fucking asked me for fucking money you know what I mean so you know what I mean I might pay for a lot of shit just something like a I'm a fun guy and like a generous fellow but you know just with my friends too you know because I believe like you know share the wealth like everyone should be able to enjoy it although it does kind of suck when you have really young friends that aren't successful it's like Louie CK is like like I have an 11 year old and a 4 year old it sucks we have to everything at the four year olds level and she can do nothing you know I mean one day you're gonna be get my ass back when I'm holding the crap in you know it's funny but like Jeff you want to have kids I was like now they're like what are you gonna do when you get old who's gonna take care of you I'm like yo dude number one I think one of your kids to fuckin take care of you and your oldest pathetic if anything I'm Mike grant like my fuckin grandfather's 96 years old he still flies a fucking airplane drives Anchorage Alaska this fucking beauty could probably beat someone up like a weak person like a woman or a child but so you know he's fucking nice he's a fucking bad you know like his like I'm taking care of all you motherfuckers so there's that but then I'm like this isn't my Hemi last year actually when this happened so just so we're having this conversation these two 16 year olds like roll up I'm sorry oh my god Jeffy Madison oh my god I read your book love but like we couldn't come to summit we're too young it's 18 plus we can't get into the clubs but we love you shit been washing for years I'm like hey great to meet you guys he's good those are my kids like again and they're like rich or doing well in like you know 20 25 years and I'm like Jeff he's living on the streets smoking crack in a gutter with cancer like we contribute to my GoFundMe that I got I remember this guy he said hello to me on in Miami let's send him a hundred dollars or what-have-you no but anyway so yeah blah blah blah obviously I talk a lot but you know we're me entering to the we're always getting back to the point so I want to hear your again worse relationship that you've seen or experienced I mean there's there's just so many and that's also like it's it's it's like so many facepalm moments where just like just just just go out more before like it's like it's really I wouldn't even want a pinpoint it down it's just like me scrolling through the rsd inner circle and it's our groups on Facebook and there's literally guys who like so my girlfriend is a virgin and she's said this thing and I really don't know how to handle it what do I do and like we've been together for like four months and I'm like where to start first of all and then it's always like she said like some some like classic classic shit tests like some shit that you learn in the first week of pick-up you know she said she said that um that I'm a nerd what do I reply I'm like first of all if you don't know that don't get in a relationship sick of all don't get relationship with a virgin like sure have sex first god dammit where do you want it like you're screening so little you literally the first chick you said that earlier when we talked about the first chick that laughs at your joke you want a girlfriend or up the first chick that doesn't run away is now your fucking girlfriend is that a position of power you're coming from when you get in a relationship with a girl like is that a healthy start of the relationship she laughed at my dumb jokes she didn't run away so obviously that I'm talking yeah I'm talking about a minority here but obviously like what I would say oh is this a big point that you should do before you can relationship is create an MVP can MVP is from the startup scene where it's called minimal Viable Product so you create something where like these are the requirements this is the prototype of an ideal girlfriend of mine and then every girl that steps into your life beat through cold approach pick up be it through you know friends of friends or circle or whatever it is yeah for example these are too fat this this is in my VAT Minimum Viable Product it's you know can't be fat it can't be fat not be I mean it's it's it's like now imagine I love how she's smiling every object culture she's a head Hey Baby wanna have some fun no I just talked about how you're too fast because she's wearing black that's shit girl tricks I know that radar is very good it's very fine too anyways but there's many there's very many tricks so the minimum vibra line there's the medieval prior Minimum Viable Product is you got to know okay this these are the go tools that I like it girl these are the know goes and it was some some ho steps over that line she gets degraded and it really is like that it's an ideal way to get a relationship is you say okay you have seven fuck buddies so you meet one new chick every week you have the ability to pull one two five new chicks a week just from Cole approach and then you just they have it's like it sounds very objective varies over very dickish now but it's like a rating system like oh Lisa just told me that she's in the star so she gets from rank five to rank for Oh fuckin Jenny she said this weird thing about her friends so she's going from number two to number three so you want to rank them you want to be aware of what's going on and how close is each girl to the tune minimal Viable Product that in essence keeps you from getting in a bad relationship in the first place and I mean and even in the relationship that can change you know it can change to where it's no longer meeting that minimum viability or whatever exactly and and the thing is to like you got to be aware of your own story this is the grade book it's called love is a story I think it's written by some professor it's really really interesting and he says which is very true is that each and every one of us has a certain story and idea of what a romantic relationship is supposed to look like for example my story is the story of teacher-student and also the story of the aesthetics which means for me it's always very important that my girlfriend physically attracts me that she's keeping herself fit that she's taking care of her skin and all the shit that she doesn't let herself go and also I don't do that if I'm in a relationship I actually train harder at the gym because I just want to look good that's just my story yeah a lot somebody else doesn't catch been in the best shape was when I was like in that relationship and like we would go like go to the gym be like and kind of support each other in that endeavor he's not getting a lot of time with that person so if you're with someone who's found a healthy who's a fucking psycho who's like doing all these unhealthy behaviors again federal maximum you're the fucking average of the five people you hang out I don't think it's gonna fucking affect you want a day-to-day basis I keep coming back those who that you have to decide at a time cuz there's so many times that like I just remember that like whether it's working out right when when we did that video I remember I used to work out every single day all the time and I just remember that it's very easy to like you give an inch they take a mile it's very simple that if you don't decide those things ahead of time you know that about yourself ahead of time all of a sudden it can just get they can wreak havoc what is your story and it's totally okay what your story is but it's important that the story fits together if her story is oh I just want to relax and eat fucking ice cream and watch movie after movie with you and you're like baby let's go to the gym there's a gigantic discrepancy and now the thing is in the first couple months when you're in there in there what's it call in that honeymoon phase you're like oh it's fine I don't need go to the gym I like hanging out with her eating vengers you let yourself go but the longer you spend time in that discrepancy between your stories the more and more Energy's gonna take from you and then you find yourself in a situation like you guys earlier said well you've been in the relationship for too long it's kind of hard to break out of it and you just you just accept it a certain status quo that doesn't align with your story for too long and now you spend a whole year eating Ben and Jerry's you've recover your fucking life and here exactly oh shit what happened my relationship was supposed to be really good but it's not anymore and because you've never had a minimal Viable Product you've never were aware of your story and her story in the first place and now you're in this weird shit where none of your stories aligns and you're just kind of there I had one where like that where she smoked like she smoked tobacco like in spliffs and I would smoke these fucking split and I was like he was like chain smoking spliffs and you know what's gonna be the player was like losing my voice all the time and it was like dude this is like losing my voice like of a stripper loser tits like fucking money you know and so I'm like this is terrifying and eventually I started to move away from those people and you see her the same with the friends too like fans who are involved in you know maybe criminal activity or just low vibrators on with a low vibrational shit like lack of motivation lack of foresight just you start to feel like more and more alienated from those people if you're on your path and you're moving forward you know and you've got to be very you've got a curate that that circle very carefully now I have a friend who that the worst relationship I've ever seen it's kind of a series of them this one super close friend of mine he you know he always seems to gravitate towards these women who were like sick like very sick like mentally or mentally ill which then leads to physical illnesses like his you know the original like loved his life who he was with for many many years was just a straight alcoholic who drank herself to death you know and I witnessed this happen over a period of 20 years and UK yeah you can't drink yourself it takes a long time you know and it gets really fucked up at the end but but again you know and I was like why because we all knew she was a problem like she was always causing all these promise you be out of the bar she's like slap a dude just so she'd have to he'd have to fight her her head he'd have to fight him you know just because she just loved seeing as a people's asses and it was kind of this punk rock's it Nancy almost kind of vibe and then you know they mellowed out they got older and so on and so forth well it's an extent but you know as much as age will mellow somebody whose predilection towards violence and and you know those kind of people but she was like very culture and shit like that and then but she was a problem she had to go she was always causing these issues right and I'm like dude when are you gonna leave her and he's like well now she got sick so he's like well now I I gotta wait till she's better again it was like that reason I gotta wait till she's better then I'll leave her like once she gets better then then I can go right like right and then you know like later another reason to be released like shit if I can you know recipes she passed away and and I'm like okay well shit I know it's gonna be a super hard time for him and it was for you know a couple years and you know but all all his friends and family were there for him and shit like that but then the next relationship baguettes into it's a very similar pattern of this like sick person who is you know become so intoxicated that they they get violent they cause these issues you know the cops are being called got rid of her and then now he's on another but that's like even worse and is literally like doesn't have a job moved into his home he lets her live there rent-free and she gained like eighty pounds you know and then like literally I I can't even fathom him them having a romantic you know relationships that way any minute relationships anymore and but now she just like fucking lives there she got him sent to jail because she attacked him and when the cops came they're like he choked me you know again it's that one of those situations and he likes sibenik and then and I'm like for sure he's gonna leave her now nope she's back in in in like a fucking couple months I'm like holy fucking shit and his breaks my heart to see this very very close friend of mine you know continue to like be engaged in his relationships you know I have another close friend who who has a similar thing you know and this is an extremely intelligent individual okay it's like he's a berry hey guys he's very smart you know but like he just seems to like get into these relationships with these you know outrageous women who are extremely physically attractive but you know tend to be involved with you know behaviors that are low vibrational energy if you will and again it's not to say that these guys don't have culpability in these relationships I'm sure they're doing dumb shit too but by the same token it makes one wonder in the first case why does this guy keep repeating this pattern you know what I mean he even asked me the other day a heartfelt moment he's like is it me like that's the only common denominator here like wow you're becoming self-aware maybe you're listening to shit I've been literally saying you every fucking day for the last like ten years like and you say this shit to these guys and what do they say they go yes I understand and there's a shit they just keep doing the same shit in the second case I mentioned this is someone I respect a great deal I find that you know that they have an intellect an amazing analytical mind and it's very curious why someone like that who again and this guy's like a master of pickup as well and like he should know better you know what I mean yet you present him with a girl who's like hi like I paid my own way and for the dinner and I have like a job and I have like a 401k he's like I'm not attracted you know what I mean it's just like dude what are you doing right but again what this should make you think it's not like these guys are losers even though they fucking are but you that's why we have to recanvass we can edit this shit out but that but but it makes me want to focus the light internally and say like where am I what are the patterns that lie my blind spots again like that I'm engaging in in my relationships because look I always I'm taking this as a point of pride at age 42 the every relationship I've gotten out of when I get out of it I say okay what's my culpability in this breakup I take it to heart I let it go but I learn and I'm saying you know what I'm never gonna do that shit in the future again in the next relationship like I'm not gonna throw an ultimatum sore I'm not gonna let go right to that well or I'm not gonna like say certain things like in anger or whatever the fuck I've done in the past I'm not gonna involve her too much in like the business or what have you so but here's the thing going forward you got to realize there's an infinite number of ways to be a fucking idiot so you'll always learn new ways to be a fucking idiot but the point is you're learning right anyway yeah I mean it's it's it's you you brought up that the point of self-awareness and that thing and I think that's where relationships and game really go together because so many people think oh like relationships that are completely different than the pickup thing like why or three picked up all here talking in a video about relationships they don't have any right to do that they have never experienced in that but it's exactly that like what does pick up teach you at the very first lesson self-awareness like how is my approach how do i wad like approach exactly how do I come across to people students do they're not rejecting you the rejecting your approach that sucks exactly so you developed a certain way of looking at yourself and see your whining is thing then they can reject you later  you realize you're for some not for others and you don't take it to heart yeah and then you can just kind of feel you you develop this way of looking at yourself and understanding okay these are the things that I'm doing these are the things I'm coming across but also these are the things that are like these are the things that I respond to now let me go even deeper and say why do I respond to this because I have for example I always thought I like the my perfect girlfriend it's gotta be the social outgoing girlfriend that is just motivating and uplifting like that's the girl I want turns out that through continuously going out for years and fucking these girls and trying to get relation with them these are not the girls I actually want I thought I wanted them but I didn't I thought I wanted them because I I felt like I need to where it is I need to have them as this object to show off like look how social my girlfriend is but it was not what something I responded to I now know better that I like the quiet girl rack and relax like the tired warrior coming home and just relax with these kind of girls while I'm out there fucking these other girls which it needs me to be energetic and all that but when I'm with my girl I want to relax I want to be with her so it's it that's where pickup in a real relationship exactly one real relationship and that's where we pick up in game go together I would have never known that if I would have just said I'm a relationship type of person I do not want to go out with them sort of purposes like exactly and your serve a role we'd sort of fucking roll and we're out there sometimes a girl just wants to have fun you know what I mean and they don't want some guy calling her back and shit like that and that's when we step up yeah this is out writing a service in the world and it's the thing and you need to nurture that you need to nurture that role in order to understand your own relationships and that's where game relationships go together like the best relationships I've been in war relationships that I entered out of full-on pimp mode where I was at the top of my game where I was epic so I was able to attract that hot 10 because at the at the very beginning the girl will respond to alpha male behavior you can't just go in with your boyfriend game like I love you for the way you are she's like no you're weird do you creepy so that's the thing that guys don't understand when they first get into this I've never Amanda like Rand jesters yeah doesn't work in the beginning you know it's great for once you're in the relationship again like something you put my girlfriend like in mind my texts on blast would be like the most like more embarrassing than any like fucking expose of like my fucking rape fan antics or what-have-you whatever it's like look look look at their little nicknames for each other okay so basically all I want to say here is picking up on that gay thing is like because I would say like RSD is the only community where having a girlfriend is gay you know oh he has a girlfriend that's good what about pimping but again like if anything if I want to communicate any idea in this video is that girlfriend game and pickup game or in essence the same they complete each other they're helping out each other you can learn both from each other you can get a really good game if you get in the right kind of relationship and you can get a hardcore epic relationship if you're really good at game do not see there's two two different polar opposites I'm more like two sides of one and the same coin a lot of guys they they have trouble transitioning into that you know because it's like an act like a professional athlete who their life kind of becomes defined by that like I've become excellent at this at this sport and now after I'm retired and they retire relatively early right so they're like aimless what the fuck do I do like you know like just define me what now so it can be difficult to like like you said there is a direct application of the skills you learn in cold approach makeup to relationship game but Elaine ice have difficulty making that leap and then furthermore they don't know that just as you're in relationship doesn't mean you're not going to be out of it in the fucking future so the game will always be a home for you and then again maybe you have like alternate types of relationships where you're still going out and meeting girls and your girl's cool with that etc whatever you know and it's kind of like a hybrid of the two so you know again the skills ultimately that we're talking about game quote-unquote are social skills you know and so it's knowing how to relate knowing how to be assertive knowing how to move things forward in a smooth way knowing how to just communicate and so I think that that's again like like you're saying I think it's extremely applicable to also to relationship game I mean girlfriends is natural experiences guys guys tend to be so they either want to rush into the girlfriend thing or they just stay so far away from it you really just have this I haven't written out in my phone I have it very explicitly my mind and it changes all the time but I know exactly what I'm looking for out of my guy friends out of business partners out of FEMA out of a girl female friends out of girls that I'm dating the girl that you end up in ed like you said as your girlfriend it should almost be like a SEAL Team six mission where like she just goes through all the these all the paces that you set up and at the end of it for her reward her prize is you for having to sort of put up with all these other things it's not the paces like like you say it kind of it kind of makes it sound like you're holding up these hoops for her to jump through that's like you're taking that gift the impression you take you too much of an active role in it like don't like like gesture it's I'd say it like you sit you've set up a maze sure and if she can navigate that maze it happens organically if she gets to know it's a maze of integrity amazing fun but it goes both ways like she's got her own like the two mazes have to click and then it's not like par with her it's not like you're trying to get a bluffer she has these mazes set up herself she comes from abundance exactly so you buy you setting up the same kind of structure that the same kind of Hoops the same kind of priorities that she that you're setting it's just you being on the same screening yeah like you're screening she's got to get through your screens you got to get through her screens and then when that happens you just kind of know like I've never had it where like I want her to be my girlfriend like I've never really thought that like I just like okay this is one of the girls I'm seeing and then we see each other for a while and then I realized wow she really doesn't annoy me that's unusual like and then you use kind of its kind of happen it's not like will you man my girlfriend my girlfriend my girlfriend in the hot tub or whatever you know it's just like it just kind of happens yeah you know we've become girlfriend boyfriend in the hot tub while she's sucking my balls you know and and it's so beautiful it's a beautiful it's an organic thing it's a natural thing it's hot it's a hot tub you know so it's hot and it's very sanitized I super chlorinate on a regular basis but in any case no like it just happens naturally like once you have these screens if you will these value systems these sort of like strategic thought towards it in place it'll just happen naturally right and when it happens it's gonna be 10 times more powerful and strong of relationship than any shit that you you were like scrambling either for again rushing into what do you say like you're either rushing into it like immediately or you know or you're just trying to be this like player guy who's like just opposes all girlfriend situations when in reality if you're approaching closing if you're doing all the right pick up stuff it's there's has to be something wrong with you if you're not gonna click with some one of these girls you're gonna meet it's in that so you have to find that balance of it's also some timing for me though I want to get into relationships or not a lot of us do with timing more than necessarily the person there's plenty of there's plenty of girls that were that that I'm sure now are in amazing relationships I remember I remembered very specific situations very specific girls that that I was just at the wrong stage of my life but they're like if I were to meet her now where she was then things would be remarkable but she was at a place then where she wanted the relationship I was at a place where I was completely emotionally unavailable distraught there's no way I would have actually worked out so timing there's just so it's such a multi-faceted I've had it happen in the reverse as well you know where like I thought okay this this girl might be good for that and then she's like maybe she says she's moving to London you know a new job or some shit it's just like again there is that element but you've also got to be a bear in mind like what is under your control and it's again developing those values developing those screens getting the abundance so you're not rushing in but ER setting what hers are and allowing you to happen organically not being totally opposed the idea but not rushing into the first thing it's fighting that balance that is the mark of the the true guy with social intelligence social mastery so that's kind of what we're advocating here and be strategic again don't look for patterns that you're doing in previous relationships or previous girls who gravitated towards or previous others that you gravitate towards and relationships hey and you know like and actually be more methodical about it and don't just be kind of cast adrift on the under the seas of love or something it's like oh well I guess this is the person that's gonna move into my house if I can get me arrested now right you can do the bass acapella it's like it's like boys to men boys to man not too hard not too soft so  anyway guys just to end up this video I'd like to tell you a little bit about girlfriend game Max's new program coming out soon it's like a nice segue it really dovetails with the topic we've been discussing here so why don't you tell us a little bit us about cuz I I really kind of I'm curious myself to be honest yeah so basically I left a couple points that you guys said developing a minimal Viable Product but also like you said making it natural and that was really the transition after I came out with a natural I kind of make this this little detour where I said yo fearless people still have approached them said it's really important but then I kind of realized like wait a minute I've so many concepts that I lined out in the natural about picking up girls fucking the hoes it's all applicable most of it is applicable for relationships and so many guys are getting in the wrong relationships they're ending up horribly it was like weird ex-girlfriends like completely bait eyes completely destroyed life and all that yeah going to they're doing it for the wrong reasons and all it's a it's a picture that it's been paying it's a bigger picture where relationships and game are just going together and I myself I've been in a in a very cool relationship for a long time now as if anyway and all that shit you know um I I was kind of surprised when I heard that you were coming out with some I go really well and I suspect you know I heard you talk about girlfriends before but again I think a lot of guys are probably to be asking us like okay max you know what makes you the guy to tell me about the the gorgeous girlfriend game exactly and and I've thought about this for a long time too and then I looked at like it's the same spiel with the with with pickup right you look at the mainstream narrative and everything that a major narrative tells us about pickup is literally the completely wrong way like just be yourself just have bring your flowers or like that guy in Owens video like just smile and laugh or smile yeah exactly and and and we've been talking about this in in with RSD for so long like don't listen to mainstream narrative it's it's misleading it's bad like this is the real world it's it might sound harsh but you got to be a fucking you got to be alpha you got a dominate like all these things and I'm like this is exactly the same with relationships it's so much like you just gotta be open yourself up and just just really let yourself go and all these like mainstream bullshit advice that we're trying to follow him again in a relationship and then it ends up horribly and we wonder why so between the men's health article on how to have a good relationship and the BuzzFeed video is there like five things in a relationship between all that I thought yo I come from the POA perspective but it's bringing this new light it's this completely new approach to relationships that nobody has really talked about in the great depth in terms of a program so let's bring that in let's talk about it let's lay it out the dirty fucking truths between maintaining attraction within a relationship between maintaining a high value relationship where you can really say like I'm coming from a standpoint of abundance I'm coming from a standpoint where my vessel is fucking full and thus her vessel is full and we could grow together like nobody ever talks about that so I wanted to bring this new form of truth in and I felt that there's a personal responsibility to help a lot of guys out and kind of pinpoint and point them into the right direction so I came up with a program girlfriend game and that girlfriend game teaches you everything you need to know about first off becoming girlfriend worthy it's really transitioning from the noob to the player to the boyfriend and it's also like you said being able to transition from this player vibe and really opening yourself up to a high quality girlfriend but not too much so you all of a sudden showed it also deals with how to find the right high self-esteem girlfriend not ending up with the wrong kind of hoe that just wants you to overeat her shit it's really like screening the girl finding the right the right the red flags becoming the right person but also how to keep the relationship interesting how to keep her loyal how to be loyal itself but also how to do threesomes if that's what you want too how also how to keep going out while you're in the in the relationship how to not just become a shittier person now to not let yourself go too much and just how to maintain high alpha epicness while at the same time having her help her grow with you help her grow herself and all that just maintaining this epic relationship with tons of epic sex stuff with her or with other girls and all the stuff that goes around that and it's all compiled in a very very nice program the website is getting me a girlfriend calm you can check that out there's a bunch of free preview videos a really high quality and it's like the natural for relationships it's as big in terms of content cost me as much of my own life time and I'm my life essence there's a lot of blood sweat tears and jizz in there that got in there and it's from personal relationships that I have myself personal relationships that I solved with people like again I think a lot of guys they may be like well what max makes you uniquely qualified to you know discourse on this subject yeah like again like I've been in many ratios to myself over the course of being a pickup teacher and also over the course of being before pickup so I kind of know this just don't realize they think that we're just out like Bank and left and right like I've always had like a primary example friend that like I've been in a quote unquote relationship with almost like you know with with elapsed in between because you know you I'm not a I used to be a serial monogamist or I just like jump to relationship relationship but now I'm like again I'm not gonna get a new girlfriend until I don't want one if you don't I mean like that that's kind of the rule of droolin said to me when I had my last breakup took like nine months take like nine to eighteen months because the thing is after every new relationship your you're ratcheting it up the standards you know it's got to reflect again your level of game increases your level of pimper increases but also your standards increase so it's still going to be like that 9 to 18 months I in my experience and it's and that's and that's what I think is cool that's why guys like us can bring out a unique perspective because we've been through all phases we've been through the this is the love before you know any game right you know how you feel we can relate to these kind of things then we can relate to the levels where you're just fucking pimping on a girlfriend that's fucking gay but we've also been through stages where we do want to commit to a girl and then we kind of feel this pressure of like I still want to go out in game how do I maintain both at the same time and I think that's what the eternal question in many ways exactly and that's I think in the question of game you know and that's what I think brings it into a very unique perspective where we say guys like us have seen it all we've approached it from all angles and this is really the best path to get a high quality girlfriend that supports you that it's loyal that has sexual adventures with you where you're just feeling like this is the kind of girl that really amplifies my life up to these epic levels and this is how you get her this is how you can game her this is how you can keep her and that's all in girl for a game well yeah I mean I'm not saying I'm fantastic at relationships but I'm I dare say I'm probably better than most you know what I'm saying so anyway wow you got really deep on this topic this kind of little surprising we're surprising how how much we all learn here this evening  the Taco Bell Goa fart you know so in any case check it out give me your girlfriend calm and yeah I hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time  you [Music],xM8mlTyYKLk
yo yo what up two proverbial boy Jeffy I'm here in San Francisco and today we're gonna talk about the three things that cause you to feel fatigued exhausted and emotionally physically and mentally drained after your night I know that when I started back in the day at the end of a night out I would just be done I was spent I'd go home and I would just immediately have like a hibernation of a thousand years essentially I mean that's a bit of an exaggeration but that was my experience like I would go out and even though I wasn't physically exerting myself I mean I guess I was walking around a lot but I would I would literally feel as though I had done a workout right I'd feel as though I had been like studying or involved in some like deep emotional sort of endeavor for a long time and I was just exhausted and this is an experience that I hear a lot of other people share especially new guys starting out the game and they're like you know I'm just I'm done with it now 15 years later my experience is the opposite now at the end of the night I feel energized I want to go out and do more I'm like you know if I haven't pulled or at the end of a bootcamp I you know the former clients gonna test that when I'm on that debrief I'm like okay let's talk about it today and I'm ready to go more and they're like please let us go to sleep Jeff but so how did I get from that point of being again exhausted at the end of the night to the point where I'm now charged up and and ready to do more it took a while and a big part of it was identifying the things that would cause or contribute to that feeling of exhaustion and over the years we've collected a lot of anecdotal evidence me and the other coaches and we discussed this and what it really comes down to there's three main things we've been able to identify that are gonna make you feel tired at the end of the night so let's list them out here the first of these is what we call self judgment fatigue and this is basically the toll that your ego was taking on you by judging you when the set doesn't go well and at the beginning of a boot camp on the first night it's kind of more of an observation night I kind of throw the guys in there I want to see they're made of what they're doing right stuff that they can do be doing better and I'm looking at not only what they're doing in the interactions with the girls but almost equally important I'm looking to see how they're coming out of the interactions with the girls are they stoked and ready to do the next one or are they you know down and depress like or do they come out of the set that girls like I got to go find my friends and she leaves and then they're like and  then they're like trudged back over and they're like well that sucked Jeff what now Jeffy got blown out you know and they're very kind of almost downtrodden they've taken it to heart they've taken to this personal attack or a referendum on their worth as human being and I'm like you know that's my job to be like okay ha ha ha you know I try as an instructor not to even entertain that kind of talk you know what I mean if the guy comes up and he says I'm in a Down State what do you think is gonna happen am I going to like commiserate with him let's talk about why you're feeling down I mean that's akin to attempting to dig yourself out of a hole you cannot think your way out of a state crash ok by pondering it and asking why analysis is important but analysis is for after the fact not during the field not when you're out there meeting people so that's option a you know the guy might come out of the sets like that option be the guy he gets the blow out or whatever the girls like fuck off and he's like Wow well that sucked oh good morning all right what's next man what's next and he's like exciting he's ready to do the next one that guy is typically gonna have a much much better experience in his night his night is gonna have a tendency to go on an upward spiral as opposed to the other guy who goes into what I call a shame spiral where he's like circling the drain of despair and his night just goes down and down and down so it's important to what we always say every approach is a hundred out of 10 provided you're doing what you're supposed to be doing and again the general criteria that we give as a what constitutes a successful approach is a did you approach not to some little half step or thing where you like mumbled some gibberish into her ear like as she walked by and like let your fingers likely graze her arm as she's like striding by purpose slee you're like well it didn't work that's not an approach that's called half-stepping okay an approach is where you make a decision in your mind to engage the girl you have decided to actually engage her I'm going to talk to this person look them in the eye and continue to converse until either they have like definitively said no thank you I'm leaving or I start to get to know them better that's an actual approach so did you approach number two did you communicate romantically as opposed to just staying in the you know this platonic interview zone and not trying to move it forward and then number three did you amuse yourself as opposed to trying to amuse them in other words are you trying to weasel your way into the girl's party or are you already having a good time internally and bringing that adding something to their night adding some energy to the interaction as opposed to leashing and asking them to buoy your state up okay so as long as you've done those three things that's a hundred out of ten approach okay think about it very few people in the club are even having the balls to go up and do that so again pat yourself on the back for a job well done just because some person didn't like your STIs that you were throwing down it doesn't mean you're a bad person or anything like that just be like huh just take again take it as a joke if you can't enjoy yourself what's the point right and you can't take yourself so seriously you shouldn't take the game so seriously after all as I've said many times before it's called the game it's not called the work for a reason okay so that's number one a self judgment fatigue the second fatigue is actually what we call persona fatigue and let me explain what that means persona fatigue comes when you're trying to again it's related to this whole idea of trying to impress it's when you're going up and you're putting on a bit of a song-and-dance Act for the girls in an attempt to portray yourself differently than how you are in an attempt to like sort of pander to what you suspect she might like right um you know put again looking at if you've ever come to my hot seat you'll know that I have a variety of footage in there I have some stuff from very recently and I have some stuff from maybe about seven eight years ago now where I had that mullet and everything in both of those both those types of footage the chronologically the the old one and the new one you know my games good I'm like actually succeeding I'm getting results but if you watch closely and I encourage the students as we're going through the videos to to take note of this you'll see that my approach back in the day it had a little bit more like hey do you like it do you like it like kind of putting on a little bit more of a character the the Jessie character if you will like again like trying to pizzazz it up like doing a little vaudeville act whereas the stuff for more recently it's a lot more I guess you'd call it grounded it's a lot more like marketing as opposed to sales I guess would be a distinction you know sales you're like hey what's up do you like it here are the features here's the features let me let me display the features do you like it do you like it you like it whereas marketing is more like you're presenting your best self but you're just like yo this is it take it or leave it again I always say think of a product that needs to be sold like Doritos or beans or something like that they're gonna here's the new Doritos the flavor extravaganza dinner to dinner right what's a product that does not need to be sold you know the new iPhone there's going to be like the new iPhones out and if people want it they're gonna go get it so again there's sort of a more grounded elements to my game now that I think is at at both at the same time it's both more attractive in a way and it also more germane to what we're discussing right now it burns less energy over the course of the night so again when you're communicating authentically you're not having to put additional energy into actually like you know making it pop and in selling the product and again that can over the course of the evening that can contribute to you feeling again refreshed ready to do more not depleted okay so number one self-judgement fatigue number two persona fatigue and the third fatigue is actually what I call hesitation approach hesitation fatigue and this manifests in and you know you see the girl and rather than approach her immediately you know follow the old three-second rule you kind of hem and haw and you're like okay I'm gonna go okay is what am I going to say okay what what angle am I going to approach from I'm not entirely certain I think that oh okay okay wait I'll wait til the friend leaves do okay oh wait okay all right three two one no no not yet three two you know and again I'm sure you're watching this video and you've gone in at all you can relate this I can certainly relate to it I mean hell even at the beginning of the night sometimes I can I can still relate to that and people might find that shocking they may like well you've been doing this for 16 years and you still have like a little bit of hesitation at the beginning of the night it's not fear so much as a homeostasis right people in general were very resistant to state change I liken it to being in bed in the morning and getting out of bed like if I'm in bed and I'm comfortable it's cozy it's warm and I just woke up I might feel some reluctance to get out of bed why am I scared of getting out of bed no I'm not scared it's just like I feel great in bed if I get up I'm gonna have to start walking around and doing stuff right so it's a resistance to state change and you need to start thinking about your approach anxiety or hesitation at the beginning of the night in similar terms right it's a remembering you're awesome for me it takes usually like 1 or 2 sets 3 sets maybe where I like I'll hit it I'll be like damn oh yeah right I'm awesome let's go some people it takes longer but again action is always the answer and you need to develop systems to get you going at the beginning of the night to get you over that initial hump to get you past that state of that hesitation where you get to the indifference threshold or as I like to call it the enthusiasm threshold where now you're not like oh I have to get up the nerve to do the next approach you're enthusiastic about the next approach like alright what's next what's next right and again for different people it takes different different amounts of time to achieve that Tyler takes a little bit longer and of course Tyler's famous six steps is something that it's a it's a series of actions that we take at the beginning of the night to ensure that we actually get into that and you know do away with that approach as a patient that burns so much energy right and the great thing about I guess social momentum if you if you want to call it that is the more you achieve it the better you will feel at the beginning of the night when you don't have it because you'll know it's simply a matter of taking the appropriate action I cannot count on both hands and both feet in both toes and my dick that's 21 times more than 21 times for sure definitely that I felt maybe just fatigued at the beginning of the night annoyed injured sick you know it just kind of out of it didn't want to do it but I followed those six steps and almost always by the end of the night I've just been having an amazing time and quite often pulling and of course those six steps I don't not gonna get into detail on them just to reiterate approach all minimize time between interactions don't judge yourself find something funny about every interaction is your movie not theirs remember at the beginning of the night is gonna be short and sweet sets and then by the end of the night hopefully longer and burn to the ground played to the hilt and last but not least add more escalation / awkwardness with each subsequent interaction and if you actually follow those steps you'll find again almost all the time even regardless of how you're feeling at the beginning of the night by the end you'll be hitting the zone and you'll be having a great time and again quite often pulling those are the three main pitfalls that you want to look out for that are going to cause you to feel exhausted emotionally drained and depleted at the end of the night what are they persona fatigue putting on a show and trying to sell yourself too much as opposed to being what the solution is be more grounded be a marketer not a Salesman put your best foot forward you know present yourself in your best light but kind of just put yourself in that middle space and give her the opportunity to meet you in the middle as opposed to like hey come on come on come on hello my darling hello my baby EU on my ragtime gal right so again persona fatigue to self judgment fatigue don't come out of the sets being like that sucked I I suck this is an awful night you should be like whoo okay awesome what's next who else would have the balls to be doing this shit right persona fatigue self judgment and last but not least that hesitation fatigue where hemming and hawing burning tons of emotional energy remember the six steps get on the ball get on top of the club before it gets on top of you make your feet move just go up you'll figure it out when you get there anyway hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you next time and now it is time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the SATs at SATs at 80% of the time this is the problem hey buddies motherfucker hey good evening but the way he said it was it lacked that conviction he's like your hahaha it has this wavering tonality the voice this is the roof of the mouth right here okay not just being loud but being cleared [Music] that's the touchdown right yeah it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of a long-term health for your voice you're gonna be able to go out in  [Music],xg0OR9LbpP4
yo yo what up it is I your proverbial boy jetty once more coming at you today from the Cleveland Rock and Roll Hall of motherfuck insane and what I want to talk to you today is about perseverance in the face of crushing agony and defeat now I live in San Francisco Bay that you know San Francisco Bay Area and therefore I guess sort of by default I'm a building State Warriors fan now look I'm a lifelong Lakers fan just for the record and I always hated this whole bullshit that the bandwagon bullshit of the Warriors because look I've lived in San Francisco for 23 years and I never saw Warriors shirts until like three years ago so I was very reluctant to get on the fucking train just ban waiting shit but you know what I got it I got to hand it to those boys they they ball it right and they ball and good unlike anything we've ever seen and so therefore you know I'm again I'm kind of a reluctant fan and so I watched this previous you know twenty twenty thousand 2017 championship with great interest and of course the previous year in 2016 LeBron in the cab they actually came back unprecedented from a deficit to actually win the entire series and they deserve every fucking bit of that honor in that glory but this year they just couldn't fucking do it LeBron couldn't do it and you know many would argue with the acquisition of Kevin Durant that the Warriors became this unbeatable Avengers style team that no one could be but interestingly enough they give it the old fucking college try and they actually creamed their fucking ass in Game four now many would argue that they got a bunch of bad calls etc etc but no one can argue that LeBron didn't play at a extremely high level and he'd really did his best to carry the entire thing now how maybe this how you may ask does this relate to game now in many ways it doesn't but in some ways it does and because you know in game sometimes you're going to have bad nights and you're going to have nights where you just get fucking destroyed regardless now let me let me give you a little story that kind of like relates to this I remember a couple years ago I was in Las Vegas and it was during the World Summit and I was at Marquee and there was this girl I was talking to and she was like super into me and she loved me I was kissing her everything was going great it looked like you know was game on so to speak for the poll and then all of a sudden I looked out of the corner of my eye there's like four dudes kind of like leering over and like whispering and piss purr into each other and I'm like who these fucking idiots and then they did like disconcerted move we're like one came in and they elected a pincher move and they like took the girl away from me and they started talking to her and while the other guy started saying some fucking jibber jabber my ear I'm like whatever I'm fucking awesome this isn't going to they're not going to take this girl from me no fucking way potential sooner or later the girl became into the dude that was whispered in her ear and then they pulled her away and then they formed this like circle around her and then I was like god dammit what the fuck and then meanwhile I see they're like pointing I mean like talking to her I'm like laughing and she had she's starting laughs - I'm like Gamma what the fuck's going on here I had no wings you know if I had some wings with you maybe I could have done like a move or something like that to get her back but I'm like shit okay what do I do obviously not coming back and I was a little too cocky so what do I do in that situation you know I can go up and my go-to move is just physically remove her from the dude so what do I do I go up and I grab her arm but hey come meet my friend company my friend and I go to pull her away but I go to a colorway she's like not coming and I'm like come on come on she's like don't fuckin don't no stop don't touch me I'm like her and the guys like hahahaha like laughing I mean I had to slink away in shame and it was just a nightmare and I remember like I couldn't sleep that night I was like damn it was like ruminating over like the horrible loss the horrible destruction and the humiliation that I had experience and I actually thought about epic fuck even like saying it right now I'm kind of like reliving the nightmare if you will you know and but it's interesting because look that kind of thing doesn't happen to be very frequently it probably happens to me about what maybe once or twice once every two years or something like that but regardless it kind of stuck in my craw and one can't help but think that LeBron perhaps felt the same way as he was walking back to the locker room after his defeat in these most recent finals and here's the thing though LeBron on some level like his accomplishments no one can argue that this guy's like the fucking one of the greatest of all time if the greatest in the game currently but like the thing is he can't do it all by himself and so two things really come to mind here in terms of relation to game number one you've got to have good wings like no like LeBron he was like fucking like this champion of the universe basically you know like if he were working related like the Marvel Cinematic Universe he's like Thanos okay versus the Avengers who like the entire team of the Golden State Warriors you know like again yes he's got he's got Kyrie Irving he's got love etc but at the end of the day he's the only one that really could could mount any sort of serious challenge to to get Durant Steph Curry etc etc draymond Green who I personally dislike you know how many people can you kick in the balls bro you know but but regardless it he can't do it fucking also if I had like a couple of my bros with me maybe we could have done our own counter maneuver so look a lot ixk to me Jeff you know I'm trying to go out but I don't have guys to go out with blah blah blah it's like look I think going out by yourself it's good for the soul I think it builds character because if you go out by yourself it's like you in the night you know there's no excuses like oh well what about Bill I don't want to abandon Bill well what about my buddy techno dude once you go out there it's like as soon as you out there by yourself and the club starts populating it's like that wave starts swelling up behind you and if you want to catch that wave you got to start paddling cuz if you know it's our paddling what's going to happen the wave crashes down and now you're getting like knocked around underneath right and you're basically at the at the mercy of these sort of vicissitudes of the environment if you will and you're you're done right you're done right so I think it teaches you that's one of the most important lessons of going out by yourself it's like once you hit the club you've got to start taking action because there's an inertia to action and there's an inertia day in action right so again I think there's many lessons and going out by yourself like I said it builds character but at the end of the day you don't want to be you know LeBron alone on the court trying to do it all against these are insurmountable odds so that's number one I think number two is not taking these kind of like losses to heart you know what I mean look like I said regardless of that like crushing humiliation I got it marque a couple years ago even though I'm still like revisiting it today it's like I still regard myself as one of the latest of all fucking time I'm one of the greatest fucking time bitches and don't you fucking forget it okay Jeff Allen bitch better ask somebody okay okay enough enough of you know autofellatio but that's but regardless you know you gotta know your own Worth and you can't take it hard and if anything those sort of things should inspire you to go even fucking harder because let's face it one night at the end of the day is not meaningful in the context of your overall development and you got Excel what can I learn from this and you can bet your ass that's fuckin LeBron and his team are asking themselves in this offseason how are we going to comeback and how are we going to defeat these motherfuckers in 2018 so anyway it's been Jeffy at the Rock and Roll motherfuckin Hall of Fame I'm going to go to a you know Trent Reznor's birthplace for some shit something it's that picture probably just crying and go to the airport and get out it get the fuck out of here as soon as possible no offense Cleveland but anyway I'm going to give you access to the hot girls you don't see at the club over the past four years I developed a replicable copy-paste system that cuts through the bullshit of online dating I perfected a program that completely automates the process to get any dates left and right anywhere I go it's simple once you know what to do this is execute the program version 2.0 the ruthlessly efficient highly repeatable systems for the modern day online gangster it's over 24 hours of pure hard-hitting fluff free content with eight hours of a build footage broken down case networks and exactly how to orchestrate the date to make sure you polar that night I  covered the exact repeatable pattern takes to take a girl home nearly 85% of the time she agrees to meet up this is my online masterpiece at bottom line - just plain works now you have a choice to make keep using the Internet to beat off or use it to have someone else beat it off for you so just add up as you want to start getting laid and execute the program [Music]  why

yo yo proverbial boy here once again to announce the winners of the fearless resonator challenge now back in May I announced the challenge from the mall in Copenhagen and what I did was I projected in a loud clear tone and instructed you to do the same for the opportunity to win resonator for free and since today marks the official end of the bonus period for resonator I'm going to go ahead and announce the winners a lot of people handed in their submissions via Facebook and other channels and some of them were pretty crazy people taking their fucking shirt off and yelling in Victoria's Secret and just screaming a lot of weird stuff going on [Music] [Applause]  Oh  Oh  [Applause]  ah  [Music] out of all of those I narrowed it down to three of the best and remember the criteria were to not just scream okay because a lot of people just screaming but also to project in a clear tone using teaching of the Areopagus sphincter as well as balancing out the hard palate so the winners uh it was began was a hard choice but I came down to three winner number one Cody P from Minnesota got into proverbial boy Cody P I'm doing the hashtag fearless resonator challenge here at Dairy Queen and Moorhead here it goes Oh  up what I really liked about this one was how he did it up to Dairy Queen it's a very complex compact area with a lot of people around plus his tone is just beautiful absolutely beautiful all right you're getting resonator additionally winner number two hails from Transylvania all right so this is a global issue double yo okay this guy's name is red du from Transylvania let's take a look in Romania middle of Transylvania and the resonator again not many people around in that clip but I love how loud and prolonged it was as well as the tones very clear it was clear he wasn't pushing is here so you get resonator as well and last but not least a little homegrown Bay Area shit this kid Miguel from Berkeley how you feeling  yeah so I don't know if this guy's a professional singer or what but I love the vibrato and I also like that he handed in two different angles one in like some sort of store a shoe store apparently and the other lying down in what appears to be the mall so it had great acoustics so you're also getting resonator for free so thanks for everybody who participate in this challenge again it was a lot of a lot of fun going through these things and seeing the ridiculousness however I'm now introducing a new challenge and in this challenge it's going to require a little bit more creativity however you're going to be able to get the top tier of resonator for free one guy will win and this is actually a rap challenge which is inspired in part by Madison's RSD rap that he released recently I was reading through the comments on YouTube of that and something's like this is the whitest shit ever and I commented there in the comment section I said wait'll you see my ramp afterwards you'll still think Madison's is the whitest shit ever so so like I said this challenge is going to require you to be a little bit more creative and what we're going to have you do is perform a short rap about vocal projection nothing crazy like 30 seconds submit it and you'll get the opportunity to win the highest tier of the program for free now why rap music you might ask well if you think about it the performance of rap really requires and sort of encapsulates all of the characteristics of attractive vocal tonality that we've been talking about in resonator stuff like variance in emotion stuff like vocal tonality stuff like having conviction in your frame when in the words you're saying stuff like changing the tempo stuff like rhythm etc etc so what I'm going to do is I'm going to get you started here and I've teamed up with how to rap drew we created a short wrap about resonator so I'm going to go first and hopefully I don't screw this up fuck one take Timmy start the music I am the resume de um jail axe bitch yo I am the resonator but since this program to shit it to be the desiccator they gonna notice he quits amended your bestest Ranger your vocal told is legit it shows a detecting nature and she respects the playa and teaches low when your dick like the duck confront a guy in Duty low wind it quick like a detonator I'm sorry Owen and Nick's by the light finesse San Diego you want a desk game welcome to Jeff Payne the voice tells it all anytime you get a stranger they know what you will fall so you think you're in danger I highly doubt that'll texture later consider sex the same and for some even on my messaging I'm out in Vegas so I guess the key could better wager I'm at the Hooters with the Cougars in reality a pool table toughened the cubox and now she's gettin cold sucker up you con oldest girl I am a resonator they call me Dale AG I get you laid bath top resonator I got the full tone so you can call home and I remember rather nervous shows ain't heard the word spoken yelling

more boxes in a fam career and the resonator they call me Jeff Allen I'll run a sex island but I have arrested me I got the whole plan execute the program I got the program they say I'm an old man I'm more like a playboy I got women on both hands but we're in a row damn I feel like you have going on a coke binge staying on every single open I think blows you think notes by Chopin the big joke is chicks oh I broke them cut that's resonating pull your bitch ass layin em v fast stay awake in this class yeah the Keystone ins again more than knowing your name or owning the frame more than making a motion change and get her wetter than the soaking rain deeper in an outfit any novocaine or buying in temperature is cooking cuz I'm throwing claims her buying temperature is cooking like it's Owens name or buying temperature is good because I know the game it all comes from how I spoke my name is my voice yes a little lamb' Ettore emphasis for you their resonator challenge and Erwin  quicky little breakdown what happened there and now it is time to dance I would go so far as to say that guys who cannot cook the set set set set 80% of the time this is the problem hey hi freeze motherfucker a good evening he doesn't know why the girl should hook up with him so why the fuck should she this is the roof of the mouth right here  right yes smelling something nice touching the shoulders ah that's the touchdown right they're not just being loud but being clear so there's rice sometimes people will say what they heard you they heard the noise  good evening you appear to be a very classy lady I'd love to purchase for you a bottle of fine red wine perhaps with chief and when you say 1 2 3 1 2 3 your voice doesn't sound bad but it's a little husky sounding that would so uncomfortable you look so nice clenching it here in order to yeah that's what we don't want okay let's read don't want we don't want that now here we have a giant model of the larynx this is laryngitis Wow they're swollen this is probably what my boss's cords look like Oh pity on me anytime what are you fucking talking that oh I'm like literally cringing she was like you my voice told us like oh like average but yours is like a baby [Music] yeah don't do this don't let sit down shut up bubble up the other four get down you're done yeah yeah yeah you're done your clothes are stupid again we want to sort of trigger that mirror neuron system to create an emotional a to MIT where we're telling stories do you want to be more excited or do you need to be more like calm and collected and that will change often dynamically during the interaction itself it's very imperative not just on a level of getting attraction from the girl to learn this stuff but on the level of long-term health for your voice you're going to be able to go out and take your finger like this and push it push it and then what and that weird and so weirdest thing when I saw this I was like what the heck is going on I believe and I truly believe it it's only a matter of time until they like me awesome and now they're addicted I love my family gave me a huge surveillance of my voice how to speak to people it teaches you how to do it the technicality behind it and beyond that you learn about storytelling and humor put on a personal no father like hell overall in along you know I write that you know it's a little act and excess costly quite training why I ever got interested in the whole game content there's like a wacky chick it's just I want to know how the fuck to project myself Jeff has actually given a language to something that I think everyone in the game has been trying to achieve we're so so so long [Music]  you  Oh  you,yM3aN1nSBVs
welcome welcome welcome welcome are we good Kevin we're rolling rolling three two one rolling wow this is a huge crowd thanks for coming out appreciate that New York good good to be here I really don't get out here too much I get hurt maybe once once twice a year tops I really kind of hate New York in the winter because you freeze your balls off and in the summer it just smells like dead animals and garbage a different horrifying scent that you've never smelled before every 20 feet and we're just on the tail end of spring and dead animals season is beginning so it's the best time to be here so awesome so thanks for having me yeah as Alex alluded to you know I've been doing this shit man a long fucking time I've been instructing boot camps now since January 2003 I do about 45 a year so you do the fucking math I'm basically sick all you cunts um but uh I've seen you know seeing it all but you know what's interesting because no matter how many years I've been doing this you'll still see or you'll still see new and interesting situations new scenarios it's kind of interesting when you think about it like that because game goes really really deep and I'm still experiencing things I never even thought that were possible like for example a few weeks ago I had an assistant of mine and I'd you guys know about the van you've heard of the consensual  well now the van the van is still going strong it's a 1980 40 Cano line when you own a 34 year old vehicle it's a constant learning experience much like game but yeah it's still going strong despite the attempts of the reptilian Illuminati overlords to take it down and destroy it and it's kind it's currently at 85 served you know we took about a year off that's he liked applauding this yeah fucking a van were like but as you as you guys know so it's a bit you know it's a bit crass I suppose but every time we you know somebody played in the van we we put a little stencil on the back and typically it's a women's restroom symbol although there are a couple of male symbols on there as well and people always say why are these dudes symbols on the back well because I had a female assistant she you know broke some dudes off in the van or whatever and the rule is whoever's in control whoever's captaining the vehicle at the time gets the stencil so it's equal opportunity for all you know gender equality in the van but anyway a couple weeks ago my assistant my Sisson tranny we're out on boot camp and I see I'm in the pizza shop adjacent to the club and he's talking to this girl in a wheelchair and it's you know it seems like it's going well so I'm entertaining her sister and the friends and so forth and then he begins making out with the girl in the wheelchair okay and and this place by the way it's a complete fucking shit show like there's some drunk dude like puking on the wheelchair behind them like and I'm like okay so anyway I go about my business my bidness and then uh I short time pass tonight and then I don't see Randy and the sister comes up to me who you know excited was speaking to earlier she's like hey Jeff do you have you seen my sister I'm like oh your sister who's that she's like she's in a wheelchair I'm like oh well I saw her speaking with Randy not too long ago so she's most likely getting railed in the back of a van and she's like what the fuck I'm like no no just kidding just kidding just kidding it and I was just kidding I actually was kidding and then so you know long story short I the club closes everyone leaves I I take the students to the van to debrief right and I go to open the van and I hear inside no no no no occupied occupied so I'm like okay all right I'm like you have five minutes BAM you know so handle your shit so I go and I wait the five minutes chop it up on the street a bit and then I go back and they're still fucking in there so I'm like dude I got a you know I got to end this I got to go I got to go to sleep right I'm a fucking old man so I get in the front and I turned the car on I turn on the radio I'm like yo okay wrap it up come on now come on now and I kind of peer back behind the curtains and I see someone kind of like splayed out and then I see behind the behind the driver's seat propped up is like the fucking wheelchair and I'm like no way dude I'm like no like okay so I wait a little bit longer and now I'm getting pissed so I go I'm like look I'm like you motherfuckers you need to get out of this van right now or you're both going to be in a fucking wheelchair it's funny right zing that's from watching television I watch a lot of television makes me real quick real quick motherfucker so finally finally they kind of you know they rage they get out and he you know he says his goodbyes and he comes back Randy I go so good you got to tell me what what happened like wow he was crazy is done I go yo so was this like an injury or like a condition and he's like well her her legs appeared her legs appeared quite frail but so I'm like okay so it's like a paraplegic he's like well when I was eating her pussy your hips were moving so I don't know I'm not sure I'm like okay and then he's like he's like yeah so by the way this is this intersection where this club's located I guess it's poorly engineered and that night it was raining really hard and and so the the intersection flooded and to get across the street to the van you had to like wade through almost knee-deep water I'm like you'll what about that water how'd you he's like oh I was tough cuz I he's like he's like she said she said I don't think I'm gonna make it through this I'm like what the fight what is like the Oregon Trail or some shit it's like you forged the river you Susie died you lost three days like yes and so so anyway and then the other the other students come back so what happened with Randy Dee did Randy pull I'm like no he pushed him and Paul it pushed so then now a third symbol has been added to the pantheon of stencils on the back and it is the handicapped symbol so again you know the game never fails to surprise who knows what it'll be next a goat head some sort of yeah same love so okay now so you know I've been I've been doing these things quite a while some guy asked me like how do you go to public speaking well repetition motherfucker right so I don't really come here with a lot of prepared comments or anything in that nature but you know I didn't want to relate that little little tale because it's been weighing on my conscience but so like who has any topics they want to discuss or you know get into questions a you there sir threesomes um okay look here here's the deal with threesomes right a lot of times you know people people ask about threesomes and you know I think a lot of times people can get this impression that it's something that it's you know it's way cooler than it actually is you know they say oh you know it sounds cool but it's actually not that cool well those people are wrong  it's fucking awesome it's fucking awesome um hahaha now personally you know I had I had a girlfriend for like about 18 months and this is a long time ago where you know we'd go out we do we do tandem hunting ok so that's kind of my area expertise I really don't know like my friend evil Jimmy for example he orchestrates threesomes with like random strangers all the time you know but that's not what I used to do we do what we call tandem hunting quote unquote and in fact I got I got a new girl who's kind of like expressed interest in it but the thing is I now I I don't believe you can push somebody to want to do this you know we having a battery issue here maybe I don't know so yeah I don't believe that you can like actually push something to do this if they don't want to do it um and so it's almost like catching lightning in a bottle you got it you got to really find someone who's going to be like yeah like I wanna fucking do this my ex-girlfriend I'd be like so honey what do you want to do you want to watch some Netflix tonight or something she's like fuck down let's go rail some horse ok she's like yeah let's go swindle some bitches out of their dreams I was like swindle some bitches out of their dreams that was her like because that was her that was her yeah that was her whole her whole deal she she had the killer instinct you know and she really wanted she really viewed it as like enhancing our life not as like oh it's extra fur for me or extra for her it's like no we're gonna go we're gonna go out we're gonna hip this girl's we're gonna hit from both sides they're not even know what the hell is happening we're going to drag them home use them for our pleasure kick them the fuck out with for they know what's going on okay right but the thing is you know she had that killer instinct I think a lot of times girls will express they'll be like oh yes I want to do this and they may even very well think that they want to but then however once you're out in the real world and you're standing in front of these people out at the club or what have you they just aren't comfortable with that predatory role so you really I think really half of its just kind of luck just encountering the right the right person but the thing is again now I will never get into a long-term relationship again until she unless she's down for that on some level at least now by the way so here's my current so with that with the tandem hunting you can you can choose to do one a couple ways I mean you can either do you know straight up you you go up and you say to your a couple and you make it known like that I used to do more of like a covert commando type shit where I in my experience it's always better to a pro if you're the guy it's better for you to do the initial walk up and I got lazy with this because let's face it cute girl she'll be able to open anyone you know as long as she's not like a complete fucking retard right she'll be able to open anyone so it's very easy for you to kind of rest on the laurels and have her go do your little dirty work for you but the problem with that is then when you do go up the girl abuse you is like like a punk ass because you weren't man enough to do the fucking step to yourself right you might notice this as well like if you guys if for example say your wing opens a set and then you go in even if you're better than him like technically they might look at you as though you're the punk ass because you're like you know writing the wings coattails so I would always go up first and then she'd come in now when she comes in you want her to come in it's a bit of a fine line because if she comes in too early the girl will typically assume that you're together and she'll like whoa you know sorry I wasn't trying to do anything here I shall leave if she comes in too late she'll be viewed as a threat you know if the girl likes you that is if she comes if the girl doesn't like you should be like great someone's here I can leave now right so again you want to look like you wanted to come in right right on the hook now basically like would I would run my my standard sheet and my girl she would just run girl attraction okay you know what girl attraction is your hair so pretty like like stupid shit like I love your bag right and then and just kind of throw the vibe out there okay and then we just pull back and then we do the old dual induction massage which was an amazing do you guys know what that is I mean this is style actually invented this Neil Neil Strauss but I I use it a great effect great great great great effect because again the main thing you want to understand is when you're when you're back at the pad you must orchestrate you both have to get attraction it's very important because if one or the other gets attraction can be bad I had many times many many a time where either you know I'm getting it on with a girl and then my girl tries tries to come in and she's like what the fuck is this who is this get her away and I've also had plenty of times where the girls are getting it on then I take my dick out they're like oh go stand over there and it's like the chick the Jesse watt whacking off in the corner show I don't want that I don't like that show that shows not getting renewed not on my network I'm not having so but yeah so you really you really got to have both but what will you do the old two objection the sauce I'd be like you know chopping up we're back at the pad what have you mixing up some cocktails perhaps and then I'm like did I ever tell you guys about my trip to India yes I like know like yeah well I went to this school with the motto raashi F&E what the fuck that means here like I like with Maharaja and they have this amazing school of massage there and they're developing new forms of massage and one of them that actually taught me it was called the dual induction massage and what they did was there were two practitioners and their hands are working on you in complete synchronization and the way that they explained to me is basically your mind can't process that many inputs and so what happens is uh it feels got a thousand hands and they call it they call it hypnosis of the hands I in fact I kind of went to this Gnostic transyl is fuck you know what here let me just show you so okay I go here now you lay down and then I'd have I'd have my girlfriend would lay down she'd be like okay and she'd lay down and uh and then I'd stand then I'd have the the target quote-unquote girl across from me I'd be like okay so here's how we do it do do do like follow my hands in complete synchronization I don't know fucking massage so I'm just like dirt the Dorko Dorko girl right and my girl my girlfriend be like oh my god it's so amazing alright then after this I'd be like okay my turn and I take my shirt off because you know it's a dude shirt off not a big deal massage and I go down and and then they start doing it to me in complete synchronization and um you know and there I am I'm like oh god it's amazing it's so fantastic Jesus Christ oh yes yes which like I'll have what he's having so I then get up and then I'm like okay and then my girl will be like your turn and she takes the girl's shirt off and then the girl lays out and then we do it and then we are on either side of it we do it to her except you know in complete securitization except this time we make it like more sexier right you know it's like getting a bit risque on the side boob and so on and and and then okay so then what you do is this so then you start then you kiss your girl right you may start making out with her and the girl will kind of be like here's like fuck what the fuck are they doing right and then and then you turn her over okay and then all kit then I kiss that girl and then the crucial moment I kind of take their heads and I just kind of go and  and that's basically it because of those if those girls start making out it's academic it's an it's a fucking done deal like you're getting you're getting it on motherfucker and the thing is the key thing with the key thing with reason though is you you must orchestrate you are the conductor you are the air traffic controller you must orchestrate that the right so it's got to go down you know you need to be in control so you got to put on your little little railroad cat or whatever so what we even had a sequence worked out of like fuck positions okay so while the girls are making out I will then take the girl's pants off and then I'll start eating that pussy right melilla and then my girl will then begin eating the pussy and while that's happening I then begin fucking my girl doggy style and while she's eating the pussy now the best part is this because then you'll make eye contact with that girl and it's like you're next that like that's like the best part right  so tight right and then so then I like I come on over and then whoop whoop OOP to do to do right and then have ever sucked my dick okay then they make out more while I then fuck the girl and fingered that girl and I forget I think we do a couple other but I'd always end up in the same position we call the triangle of love and that's where I'm like on my back and then the one girls on my face facing that way and the other girls riding cowgirl on there and they're making out while I'm bit and then I bust off in a position so it's like the triangle of love you see now um yeah but yeah anyway so yeah I mean that's kind of the basics I mean you know but that if you if you do have fucking dual injections so I think that's the biggest problem to a lot of guys they'll be able to get the girls home and they're like kind of like okay what do I do now like how do I broach this subject how do I you know even though they clearly know that's the subtext I mean if they're going back with you they should right it shouldn't be like surprise I have a dick and she has a pussy like good right yeah I mean and and we fucked up many times and that should happen to and then they go out and break my windshield and duh I mean dude I've had my fucking windshield smashed so many times in the past 12 years I get a discount at the fucking glass man I'm not even kidding I get a 10% off a one glass on beige or you ever go to San Francisco that's your go-to for automotive glass work  but yeah but now anyway so like I said I got to kind of I kind of have a new girl that we're starting I'm starting to kind of get into it the thing is you don't really want to talk about necessarily if she brings it up great that's that's what happened in this instance but it remain it will remain to be seen if she has the you know the eye of the tiger the thrill of the fight rising up to the challenge of some asshole and and the last stone survivor smokes his bull in the night and watched us all with the eye of the tiger but but my so I took her out a couple weeks ago this big festival called beta breakers which is one of the few FET it's called straight pride they call it sort of a few festivals you can still get naked at in San Francisco you should be able to get naked all the time it was absurd you know then they legislated against it because there were these old men the only people that would do it were like 80 year old men look like it's ever the people you'll want to see naked right it's never like guys some old person but like balls down to his fucking knees I don't want to see that shit I want to see fresh handsome balls right but but but anyway yeah so they legislated against but it's funny because the previous year I had gone to the boot camp or I had gone on boot camp to this festivals called Howard Street Fair and I remember the student had been a bitch all weekend okay he's just a punk ass he was friendly friendly times friend to friend so one of the main things I'm trying to do on a bootcamp is get the guy to the point where he now has the emotional leverage to start behaving more aggressively if you will okay and when I say aggressive a lot of times people here then they think you know aggressive like in a scary way right but when we talk about aggressive typically what we're talking about is in a fun and cool way right you're moving things forward you're making it um you're making you're structuring in a smooth way and it's just fun right it's fun just fun Hey right so but for most guys like what do they do as we all know especially well not everyone but a lot a lot a lot the biggest problem I see with guys coming up boot camp is that they when they approach the women they speak in a friend to friend modality a friend to friend communication style so they go up and they say hi are you what are you doing what's your name where do you live where need what do you work what is the thing how about that local sports team yay the weather is quite enchanting how are you like and again they they basically again the girl be like okay polite conversation for five to ten minutes followed by a hearty handshake in the phrase it was nice to meet you I have to go find my friends get a drink go to the bathroom go dance kill myself whatever so you know and you'll get that extremely consistently now in a again for a in a boot camp they they're being you're being pushed to do so many approaches that you will get this aggregate of nice to me use that might take you if you're just going out by yourself might take you months or even a year to get that many nice to meet yous so what that will do essentially it's going to create a it's going to create that emotional leverage for you now that's again that's an old Tony Robbins concept it's been spoken about ad nauseam but basically it's when the potential pain of making a change becomes outweighed by the very real pain of continuing to do things as you've been doing them okay now what differentiates man to woman communication from friend to friend communication is quite simple it's basically your tonality okay you know if you listen to my tonality up here cut kind of sound like a dick like a bit of a cocky dick you know it's it's it's always neutral it's it's like I never lilt up at the end like so um good evening guys um it's great to be here um how is everyone tonight um do you like me do you like me do you like me up I'm give a fuck if you faggots like me okay I don't know I'm just kidding I need a hug internal I'm a heffa but but you get my point right so it's like again so it's it's either neutral or slightly breaking rapport we call positive dominance so it's positive but it's also dominant yeah right it's a little little game show II maybe a little touch of via you know game show host with an era of studied nonchalance if you will so there's that so it's tonality it's also squaring up eye contact looking people in the fucking eye this thing is so fundamental and yet no very few students actually do it they actually very few square up they all think they're doing it so it's gotten to the point where I have to make like a specific exercise so to look people in the eye because they don't remember to do it so it's getting squaring up body language eye icon take vocal tonality and then of course there's a verbal aspect which is statements of intent right layering and statements of intent what's the statement of intent I wish to fuck you okay uh you know I tend to I tend to start off very innocuous Lee I I layer in my statements of a tenant start off innocuous I become more explicit so I might start off saying right Tina you appear rather fashionable this evening are you a fashion person I love your look it's hot okay that's what's there look could be their hair it could be their clothes could be their tits it could be its ambit it's quite ambiguous okay then I might take it a bit more explicit and I might say so damn were you always hot or were you like a nerd and then became hot oh cool anyway did it no no you don't let it linger it's I like this discrete separate thing we're like and now now it's time for the statement of intent here it comes me and then like did you like it like like looking for response it's almost like an afterthought I'll be like yeah so bla bla bla bla I took the trash out the other day and I just got Obamacare and I'm really pleased about I'm gonna have all these surgeries I don't even need it's fucking awesome so damn you had you always had heard you like a nerd that became hot it's like yeah so anyway like I was saying did it it out Bhama comes to your house and he strokes your head and he says I care for you I um care for you right I got the top tier the top tier motherfucker and so it's kind of like it's woven into the fabric of the conversation so they almost don't even realize it's it's there so and then I might take it up even crazier I'm like yeah like two Eskimo kiss your pussy I want to suck my own dick shit like that want to lock you in a room for a month you wouldnt get out of the room for a month we just fuck all day and night there only be short breaks for food and hygiene so anyway did it it did it did it right in so statements of intense and starts to and ramped up and then of course physicality physicality so you know and I might start off with physicality like oh like a little finger interlacing and then it works up to fucking motorboats you know I motorboat pretty much every girl I speak with and it's for charity it's for the Leukemia kids if it like I'll be like I'd be like a doula I'll be like do you like boats oh I don't know boats anyone what's your favorite kind of boats like I don't know like a sailboat or something I don't know mine is motor about a little bit a little bit a little bit and you like what the fuck like if she he says like some if she becomes like you know upset or a feta back I beg really you didn't see that one coming what kind of boat to your wahoo you didn't she didn't see that one coming besides it's for charities for the Leukemia kids okay every motorboat brings a child brings one of them cancer kids one step closer to their dreams how dare you how dare you what the fuck do you think you are you know what again a little bit you know what again yeah yeah wait hold on hold one sec one sec so the thing is back to the main point here so I'm out at this fair and I'm dressed like Elvis or some bullshit I got like a booze guitar which is a guitar filled with booze with a straw that you can get shit-faced and I see the student and again the students been a bit of a punk ass all week he's still friend a friend despite the many many reference experiences of you know getting the negative I mean cuz again women will punish bad game ruthlessly why because they are not running a sex charity for losers like oh you know he seemed really nice his games bad I guess I'll suck him but no so how this shit works okay so he's he's been getting pummeled you know nice to meet you nice immunity so whatever so long story short I come and I see him and he's talking to some woman and this woman's like some old lady like my age and yeah as and you know her body was pretty hot but her face appeared like some sort of major league baseball equipment like a like a cat like a catcher's mitt right like a catcher's mitt but you know she body was hot so whatever and then he's like kinda and she's like you oh honey damper dinner and she's like you HOT but he's just kind of like I'm like you know what step off motherfucker boom and I like shove him away I'm like yo come here she's like hey I'm like yeah she's like putting her hand on my dick I go oh really here have a look and I just and I take it out and this is in the middle of the intersection at like 2nd and Howard at like 2:30 p.m. yeah it's like a fair is a street fair and then and then so I my dicks out and then she gets like she starts sucking my dick in them in the middle of street and I'm like I'm like see do you some I'm like do you see now and he's like yeah okay it's like it's like taking her he's like taking notes sex take dick out old lady sucks your dick and anyway kind of funny PostScript to that she um so I finished out the program and she'd give me your number she's like where are you I'm sorry I'm I am well I guess I'll go so I go over her house and she's like you needed she's like hold on my dog's quite quite aggressive I'm like oh and it's like some fucking pit ball I'm like okay whatever and so I start banging and the dogs like like getting all antsy and like it's on the bed I'm like is this dog gonna be ok she's like no it's fine just pluck me so it's our fucking her the dog bites my fucking face like cheer I'm like a pop I like I punched the dog in the nose and we're kind of just both like we're like I'm I get this fucking dog out of here and she's like no he can stay I'm a deacon I can't stay as I get the fuck out those is quite horrible and then so the following week my my girlfriend we're out to dinner or something and she goes she's okay yeah so I Rachel said she saw you at the fair as I go cool yeah no idea I didn't see her there she goes yeah she said that some old lady was sucking your dick in the middle of the street I was like I was like well what me one me we broke up shortly thereafter it's like that's too much Jeff it's like I can deal with your postings about fucking 18 year olds in Canada but not not when you're it's little too close to home so yeah mmm right I don't even know what the point elsewhere is that okay yeah yeah  yes my first question is how do you get chicks oh you're like iPods and when you're on the phone and whatnot well you know that's a difficult that's a difficult thing because nobody wants some weirdo coming up to him tell them to get off their fucking phone I mean I know that because my girlfriend to do it to me all the time really pissed me off I'm trying to like check my facebook or something here it's very important you know again it's gonna be a mixed bag I I will never forget the one time I saw Tyler do this and this is when Tyler had been in Hawaii for several years now I don't know how many guys have you been in this room have followed rst for like years and remember the Tyler in Hawaii phase where he was like this obese creature he's a quite obese creature now I'm not fat shaming or anything like that but he you know he he had lost he had fallen off okay it was funny cuz that was kind of the dirty little secret rst at the time Tyler had fallen off because he was in this like Howard Hughes reclusion in you know seclusion in an island I remember when we first brought Alex on you know Alex I kind of mentored him he took he took his boot camp with me before we brought him on and then they finally brought him to America and around that time Owen had came back to America as well he went out with he went out with Alex and then Alex called me up he's like night I'm like what he's like is Owen testing me I'm like what what are you what do you mean he's like well I went out with him the other night and he sucks I was like oh no no yeah he sucks yeah he sucks is that what why I'm like yeah you know that's you know he's been in he's been falling off and it's not so so anyway after that though Tyler had to come back harder than ever so he went out for like another like 18 months seven nights a week much like much as he had done when he first got in the game and then he blew past us all again right and so I remember being out with him once we're walking down the street is in New York actually this beautiful girl walking on the street and she's on her phone and like he's on the phone and Tyler rolls up he goes you and she's like he's like put that shit down right now and I'm like I'm like oh I'm like I'm like like cringing like but then she just goes she's like who are you like it starts talking to him and he like makes out with her within five minutes I'm like what the fuck is this I couldn't believe it right so I guess that's how you could try that caveat emptor buyer beware buyer beware on that one but I mean the thing is his reality was it was just his frames were so strong because he you know why because he was going out again seven nights a week in in Hollywood talking to these like stuck-up motherfuckers in these clubs it just builds your frame to the point like I think I think to a large degree I mean one of the biggest most overlooked tenets of game is that old that old chestnut whatever you feel they feel again old model of game was go up say something that's calculated to get a good response from previous you know experience take a routine and then they'd laugh and then the laughter would in turn give you confidence good emotions validation and enable you to continue the interaction well the new Quantico model of game is not very new anymore is put yourself in the state that you want them to be in you go up and then using that law of state trance for that mirror neuron effect right you basically draw them into your reality and then you lead it from there now of course this isn't the end-all be-all you could be the greatest having the greatest time of your life and go up and someone just ain't having it right and the thing is I always tell guys I say look tonight when we go out I don't want you to be basing your criteria for success and whether or not the girls liked you or not now but that's pretty weird cuz it would seem like that would be a pretty good fucking metric wouldn't it if they liked it it worked if they didn't like it it didn't work but the bear fact of the matter is it's not a good metric because you can't control the element of randomness you don't know who you're talking to you don't know who you're approaching you could be approaching someone who's like a bona fide lesbian you could be approaching someone who's having the worst PMS in the history of PMS you could be approaching someone whose fucking parents died this morning in a fiery automobile accident I don't know why they're at the fucking club but actually if I'm being cynical that's probably the best set to approach but you know but uh oh it's okay dead parents dead parents like how fucking terrible is that right but but no the point is so again we want to we want the focus to be eternal on things I can control what can I control I can control the fact whether I took action or not did I approach I can control whether or not I was behaving or communicating as a man to woman versus a friend to a friend and then I can control whether or not I was trying to impress or you know I hope it works do you like me I hope she stays and keeps talking to me or are you just amusing yourself now when I say I'm using yourself doesn't necessarily mean you're like cracking jokes you know for example a lot of times on my program I'll show like a short video of Owen in in a set and he's he's not really cracking up he's just kind of talking about you know he's like he's like the girls like are you drunk he's like no I'm simply present to the moment he's like he's like I don't drink alcohol the closest thing to alcohol I drink is kombucha from Whole Foods it's like fucking dork right but but you know that's but they're like it doesn't seem they're like Jeff it doesn't seem that Owen is self-amusing here but what they don't understand is that is his version of it right he he gets off on that on being this like health freak on being centered and you know being the boss at business and shit like that being in control so I mean again that's really what you want to aim for if your strength of reality is such and you have all those three things dialed you can go up you can do the perfect approach but they still might not be into it so again you you you realize there's not a single guy in this planet that every girl likes right not a single one and when you realize that it frees you up and as long as you're doing everything you're supposed to be doing however that's easier said than done right but as long as you're doing everything you're supposed to be doing basically you see why we basically just we say our night a big part of the fun of our night is going through doing your approaches and finding the people you have chemistry with so we don't see a rejection you see lack of chemistry now I'd like to introduce him  man the myth the legend the man the myth the legend the the Nick Fury the Nick's few of our creepy Avenger squad mr. Owen gee cook although I don't know that that's his middle Cameron but he's a fucking G so we're calm ong cook feature confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion confusion,ycvRJPkzdP0

yo yo yo what up this is your proverbial boy Jeffy I'm here Miami with Doc testosterone he had world-renowned maybe not yet but soon to be world renowned neuroscientist and his specialty is probably as you guessed it increasing your testosterone now as a guy who's you know a noted scumbag and lover of vagina I had also a professional at it I've been doing this job for a long time I first got into pickup professionally when I was 26 and now here we are 14 years later and for those of you who are good at math you can put two and two together and I'm I recently turned 40 last month and it's so crucial I found you know I'd noticed definitely I probably have a higher sex drive in the average guy you know just just by virtue of I'm a pretty pretty horny dude but I did I have noticed that my sex drive is in a way used to be let's put it that way right so as the guys doing this professionally I want to be able to get out there in and pimp it because of your testosterone reason isn't up you're really not even in the game dude you're you're just going through the motions you know and the girls can sense that the girls can sense that that there's they'll be like where's the beef you know what I mean and so you got to have that so I want to talk to you today about um you know various ways like I can go about maintaining that I've done some stuff you know I take supplements I take you know I take d8 DHEA what else do I take I I don't know I take like sink okay copper zinc magnesium and then I take sometimes I take that what does it maca maca maca powder so but aside from that what what can guys do that are watching stew or maybe getting up in you know long in the tooth to keep to keep their testosterone up so before I talk about the details of how to naturally boost testosterone I just want to say thank you because that there was one time during a boot camp debrief this was in Scottsdale right I don't know if you remember but I was I was like arguing with a waitress and you told me to like take a timeout you like a man don't insult the waitress go take a timeout and I this was like my second boot camp ever case than you and I was kind of like I kind of got scared right and then I took my time out of hates okay it's okay Jeff he's like that you know it'll be fine then I came back and then we became friends again and during that boot camp debrief when you went on and on to like 7:00 a.m. at one point you made the student realize and I was listening and I was you know I was assisting but I was also student realized the importance of having a boner at the club and evil Stifler was there too all right okay it was one of them it was one of them uh and and I was listening I was like okay I don't get boners when I my clubs right I have this anxiety thing when the girls next to me like I'm kind of turned on but I'm also scared right so the the boner doesn't like happen very easily yeah and then I was thinking maybe the reason that Jeff is so good at the fact that he can attract so easily as well as other arse instructors is that they just have higher testosterone and it may be genetic it may be maybe something they're doing it maybe their energy levels it may be that they're just having more sex what the fuck is it so that bootcamp debrief just getting taught from you was one of those X Factor's one of those turning points yeah Mia to actually go on my journey nice you don't even know that I just learned this at school so Thank You Man thank welcome uh to answer your question so there's basically three ways to increase testosterone ripes sleep diet and exercise okay so the thing about sleep is sleeping can continuously throughout the night so not waking up like a lot of people do like I used to do for diet it's eating a lot of fat right so monounsaturated fat saturated fat steaks egg yolks avocados Brazil nuts almonds right salmon rice with like fatty fish so these are the these are the foods you should eat to increase testosterone and then for exercises as compound movements movements that use big muscles like your butt and your leg you know quads and so on so squats deadlifts benchpress lunges pull-ups these are the exercises you can do which I'm sure you do those are all the ones that you actually they're pretty much the only ones video too good is gonna slam those maybe a couple of assistants lips out you know yeah and in terms of supplements supplements are great so vitamin D is oh yeah right so vitamin D is one of the major supplements for increasing testosterone if you're deficient in vitamin D no matter what you do you're gonna have a hard time having high sex drive having the erection quality that you want also just having good energy levels during the day right you want to lift those energy levels you want to pimp it all the way at night at 5 a.m. just go on when you see that chick you just go and do what you need and it's also for increasing muscle mass losing your gut and you know one thing I noticed about you is you have gone like a transformation right in your fitness yeah I'm cyclically you know it's like after the holidays maybe not so good but then you know in the summer it's like it's kind of like a yearly cycle but but yeah you know I've again especially as a 40 year old guy you don't want to be like some-some slub you know some like booking they do you I mean could you do that sure but you know you're gonna a lot of those are gonna price you out of the market you already got the old guide thing going against you which isn't necessarily bad you can be like distinguished accomplished and all that but still you got to maximize that you know totally agree man I mean I'm I just turned 34 I I underwent this transformation in my early 30s I mean my testosterone was that of an 82 year old haha I really well what was it it was like 222-2222 so I'm like that it was really low yeah and I mean dude I will I worked hard man I went out to Elliott Hills just still I do that shit you know learn not just not just getting muscle mass and just like losing my gut I used to die I lost like 27 pounds of body fat yeah just like in the last eight months and the first three months were like massive like it's unbelievable but then it's also about breathing and having that just that bioenergetics feeling being able to breathe into your balls having that energy flowing all through your body and a lot of that will also boost testosterone and like attract women so that helped me a lot too now in terms of let me ask you this in terms of in terms of the sleeping you know a lot of people will they'll take melatonin and I hear you know it's a little controversial that they say you might down regulate natural production and you know I was talking to mark Tama about this in fact and he thinks that you know melatonin is in fact very crucial to preventing cancers and things of this nature so what's your what's your opinion on melatonin supplementation you think it's that's good or should you go the route of you know wearing those amber colored glass orange glasses like yeah the blue blockers I you know it's kind of side note I was wearing I decided to get those no Google and so I originally got the blue blockers you know the the classic blue blockers and from late-night TV and I warm in the house they're too dark to wear in the house so now I just wearing when I'm driving and like I picked up evil Jimmy in the van the other day he's like what the fuck is this I'm like my blue block is like more like boobs blockers cuz you ain't gonna get no boobs wearing that I was like the ragas they look hella stupid but but then no I got like some like some safety ones for construction now and so what I don't know what's your take on it so first of all I was I've done a lot of research on supplements so whenever I used to go into just GNC s and vitamin shops and stuff I would always ask them hey man what is your number one seller what the fucking sell and they would always take me to the sleep aid aisle and set just point to melatonin right we we sell this shit and what I found is a lot of people have trouble sleeping as we know and everyone takes melatonin now yes so melatonin is a negative feedback system just like testosterone right so if you inject testosterone in your body or you wear gels and stuff your natural testosterone production will stop eventually just like be just completely diminished melatonin works the same way now my take on that is if you have a really really hard time sleeping try to figure out the source of it you don't want to be addicted to melatonin your whole life yeah it's cheap yeah all your friends are doing it but you wanna under you want to figure out the stress that right not don't just cure the symptom right so if you're not sleeping that's a symptom of some deep down shit that's happening right so if you're stressed out if you're not eating well if you're not exercising if you're not a like if you go through a really good sex session at night you're gonna stop well yeah that's true I mean just simple that you're gonna sleep well the chick is gonna sleep while you're gonna wake up during the night and I've set more sex than you're gonna sleep well again you know what I mean so and it's not just about sleeping man it's about REM sleep right here so a lot of you like fucking Larry King right I was watching Larry King one day back in the day I think he might be dead now but or maybe he's still alive say 170 years old no I guess a lot of so something like infomercial for like some facial at least talking okay official is big - that's actually like 2 or 3 the supplement industry but so so Larry King only sleeps four hours a night right and a lot of other like famous people yeah smart people sleep sleep less it's because even though you might sleep six hours a night you're getting a lot of REM sleep because you have deep sleep you might have genetics you might be eating a lot of fat at night that's also something oh yes ah strong yeah I always take when I take my fish oil I take it that night sick yeah I say that's perfect yeah fish oil is really great a lot of people don't have the ability to get that salmon get that fatty fish yeah I also try to get like from whole food sources as well but you know not stuff like that but yeah absolutely man exactly that's actually one big difference in my diet I eat a lot of fish I try to get that natural fatty fish that natural is just it also has vitamin D right so you can't always get sunlight exposure and then vitamin D production in your body oh yeah especially this year we've been here in Miami for five days I haven't seen the Sun once like I wake up at 4:00 wake up at 4:00 p.m. like get ready by the time I go out the sun's down go to the club all night like the Sun we see is like at set that dawn when we put a bed like so unfair man so unfair yeah it's it's it starts and you know like for pimps and stuff you you're sleeping at 5:00 6:00 a.m. sometimes and you wake up late what turns out the scientific studies show that if you don't sleep according to the circadian rhythm you're still okay on average it is not the circadian rhythm that's gonna regulate your testosterone it's the actual sleeping right so you go to sleep at 6:00 a.m. as long as you are in a dark place you got your blackout blinds or you had you know you're wearing your your sleep my nowadays I have my blackout blinds but I also have yeah out of both - yeah yeah I get this really nice it's called a I seal and it like sticks to your eye oh really and he's I mean I was using like the standard like Walgreens crap there's that one day now I got this other one that's it looks like a my girl print college it's like an AI bra you know that one would like the cups yeah and that one works pretty good night into the Hardesty we're all about the blacked out curtains and I have that shit in my in my room and I also have the you know but I'm asked but this world what's it called again it's called I feel okay yeah it's like some companies California I might I have an ophthalmologist corneal specialist guy and he's like order this shit oh nice I got that it's really good man it's the best I've ever had so nice yeah yeah so it's I talk about just don't let sensory stimulation yeah I actually come into your I should put white noise to perfect tom I hear what do you think it is like what does it call beam in aural Beats or spine or yeah an aural is that is that good I also there's no study with I look this up there's no study that relates binaural beats the testosterone but in terms of like meditation in terms of getting relaxed anecdotally it's there I mean I I like you know I do this YouTube there's like a nine-hour straight up I mean the other language there's certain ones that will induce deep sleep and stuff like that or it's not supposed to be listened to while you're sleeping right no it's eight while it's like a motor like meditative it's more for relaxation yeah okay yeah but it might have sleep I don't know I also heard that the older you get the less sleep you need is that is that true like from a medical standpoint so I don't know about that specifically I know anecdotally that does happen I mean as I'm getting older I need less sleep I usually nine hours now I need like seven and a half eight right so but yeah I've seen that anecdotally that engine so yeah so the compound movements so again we like to recap here we're talking about you know make sure you're getting proper sleep nutrition the big ones are going to be vitamin D the fish oil and what what else would you put in just your maker magnesium is big magnesium as well as zinc so zinc is actually one of the top deficiencies in America and Laurel especially in men because it's really hard to get like actual whole foods that have zinc in it so steak it steak has zinc almonds have zinc Brazil nuts have zinc these are one of the few things that actually have zinc oysters have zinc right but the interesting thing about zinc is that copper and zinc compete with each other in the in the bloodstream for absorption right but oysters also have a lot of copper right yeah cuz my doctor he told me uh yeah my doctor I go to zoos named essentially doctor no like the James Bond villain that's his fucking name doctor he's a is he Chinese like gif Vietnamese here so but anyway he's like yeah I was like you're taking the sink you gotta take the copper - yeah yeah it's interesting yeah because what so it's also how your body absorbs stuff so if your body is better at absorbing copper then zinc and you're eating a lot of oysters then you may not get a zinc boost Oh cuz it's absorbing copper in scum p-ting with zinc so so there's a balance okay so you shouldn't take them together is what you're saying I wouldn't okay all right I mean not now difference right if you don't have a deficiency then you can take them together you're fine okay but a lot of people have zinc deficiency so you take zinc 30 milligrams 250 milligrams per day yeah right that's like one zinc tablet and even that it depends on your absorption yeah so what I recommend is stick to your steak Brazil nuts almonds take take shit that has already singing yeah yeah you always trying to get from whole food sources if possible so okay so we're talking about yes that sleeved compound movements ASI firm liked it like any other workout stuff you want to talk about from like just from a strictly helping with testosterone basis or just like stick with the compound movements Sprint's opens are great uh like the high-intensity interval training yeah yeah so hit training it so hit is amazing but even better than it is sit sprint interval training okay right so for hit it's usually you go for let's say a minute you run as fast as you can 45 seconds to a minute but then you rest for four to six minutes oh that's like what the science shows but for sick you can just go 30 seconds on 30 seconds off ten times yeah because that's what I'll do if I'm doing like you know I dude steady-state cardio several times a week but then I'll also do I find I can't do that sit more than once or twice a week because it's very draining yeah it's very fucking training so I'll like what I'll do is I'll do a warm-up like five minutes and then I'll do like 20 seconds is like as far as I can go like almost puke mode rest for 40/20/40 I'll do that for five minutes cuz then complete rest sit there for five minutes steady state for another 30 and then and then maybe another like set of like 10 10 minutes of more leisurely hip style and then like warm cooldown but yeah I would add the sign like just yeah very tired I gotta like take like a Epsom salt bath or some shit that that shit works that's cool man I used to take so another interesting thing is the bats right so there's this theory that if you take cold bats Oh cold showers cryotherapy is gonna reach the stars I thought that was for psychos yeah fucking cricket well so here's the interesting thing so there's oh there's this there's this quoted study that that says that so testosterones triggered by something called luteinizing hormone yeah in the brain right in the pituitary gland so the study that people quote is that luteinizing hormone is increased by taking cold baths ok but the study doesn't really exist anywhere like it we I cannot keep backtracking like yeah Wikipedia then you go to this blog and that blog there's no study well that's what's interesting like like it's some kind of virus or something like people just like oh there's this study but there's no study now that doesn't mean it's not true is there just there's no study yet yeah but it could I mean it it it helps me like I don't know if it's a symptom I don't know if it's just a correlation but when I did cold bats I did for three months I did cold bats every day for about 10 to 15 minutes in 55 degrees Fahrenheit and it helped me like I I got blown or so yeah I go to this banya like in San Francisco archimedes banya and I ever had a plot so treatment no - it's fucking great it's like this traditional dip with a date they take a um a faggot of oak twigs and I say a faggot I mean a bundle of sticks like a literal fagot of faggot oak sex and you're going to like this fucking yes 200-degree fucking steam room and then this bitch I beats you with the fucking twigs like in like feathers move you like it's bizarre right it's like holy shit I think I'm gonna die image like now you jump in this cold plunge do it several times and like you go you think you're gonna die too and then then I pour this cool like water over you and then you're like totally relaxed but yeah so I fuck i fucks with the cold plunge but I don't know if I'd want to do it every day yeah I did one of those things with Owen oh yeah we saw a guy getting this treatment done who's like oh that's what it looks like well yeah I know it's automatic saunas are great actually men so one thing people don't understand about this dosterone is that it's not always about like directly increasing it but also getting rid of shit that decreases it okay right so a lot of oxygen is a dress yeah right right like there's free radicals in the body that are gonna cause a lot of oxidative stress and you're gonna have bloating you're gonna have inflammation all of that will reduce testosterone so saunas are great so good man helps so much saunas eating foods that have antioxidants right so like blueberries yeah yeah that helps a lot too yeah normally I don't like to eat like drink a lot of like fruit juices but I'll often drink like blueberry juice and like those small doses all ice especially after workout like pomegranate juice something like that yeah so cool man yeah this has been very informative um so shit man thanks I I never knew about that Scottsdale thing but by the way you know it's funny too because like I it if you meet see me at the club I'm kind of like this obnoxious fucking like weirdo to almost everyone there's only like one group of people that I'm always consistently very like submissive and like very nice too and that's the fucking staff that works there right somebody's nice to you but they're not nice to the waitress they're a bad person right that's that's like a rule of thumb so yeah like it cuz dude these people they're suffering lungs like these drunk idiots coming in and I work in the clip type I feel like they're like my co-workers you know so like the bar staff like if I'm like yellows adarand like some like staff worker in the bars like coming by with glasses I'm like oh sorry sir like that's the one you'll see that's the one person like super polite too but anyway yeah glad I could like help set you on this you know journey and thanks for thanks for stopping by if you're interested this guy's up be sure to subscribe it's doc testosterone rapidly-growing like coming out with new stuff new content on the Reg on the motherfucking bread y'all so again Jeb et and we'll see you next time keep your dick  you,z03My4ALwyU
I really don't think there's any single topic with more confusion surrounding it than my sanity I see some comments from various people here about a fellow called Jeffrey Allen Jeffrey Allen or Els Jeffrey Allen Jeff we all know who Jeff Allen Haley is just look up any piece of media coverage what are you gonna see you're gonna see articles talking about a for belligerence he's the white Kanye I would just basically sum it up to a dumb midget with emotional problems that would be the best definition I think he's incredibly similar actually to a baby seal it's very like oh my god the dumb midget is coming okay hide your girls hide your wives hide your fucking taters  of course you know they couldn't be more fucking right  you  you,zGru023S72g
[Music] hey hey what's up Jeffy here in Dallas Texas the home of liquid cheese aka che so tequila con queso the official drink of Texas just finished up a program here with Owen aka Tyler and about to actually head off to the airport but before I did that I wanted to address something that's been bugging me on the forums surprise surprise and what that is specifically is a sort of overall tone of of chauvinism okay of male chauvinism that I see on these boards and you know comments like bitches ain't shit you know make these bitches buy dinner these bitches are just value sucking whores and and this and that yadda yadda yadda yadda yadda No is this anything new really absolutely not even from the old days of the Usenet boards this was kind of the kind of a prevalent tone throughout it kind of it's like boys club no girls allowed type thing and I was massively guilty of it as well you know I'm looking back at my old post from those days I'd say a lot of shit like you know fuck this I'm going to make the bitches buy me dinner and all this stuff but you know I'm now at my advanced age and my best at this is that stage of the game that I've arrived at I kind of view this up as just childish and completely unnecessary and in many ways it was a knee-jerk reaction back then to feeling a feeling that we know I was getting played by by women and so now I had this power I had all this power and I was going to get back at them and and I was going to turn the tables well I'd like you to think this if you read like feminist blogs and you see how feminist rail against men and and just look at how like what an off-putting tone that is well with this this whole chauvinism tone basically it's the exact same thing but it's just it's the begin to that yang so I mean basically what we're doing with that when you're when you're making these kind of snarky little like fucking butthurt comments really what you're doing is you're becoming just as bad as the feminists actually say we are you're you're living up to their stereotype so what kind of led me to having a change of heart because when I actually started having success back in the day I think you know good they're playing these power games and so on and so forth but I realize that they're actually not okay they're actually not and in fact they're not even most of the time thinking about this shit they're not even thinking about this and what made me change my mind about that was actually experiencing kind of what a girl experiences well you know I'm going out I'm having all this volume I'm working like seeing all these girls you know multiple you know in the double digits of girls and I'm also working double digits of numbers as well and so you know as it turns out it's weird because I'm kind of thinking like as I'm going through my life I'm like you know I really like this girl and I want to hook up with her but what ends up happening um I actually don't just because there's not enough hours in the day to handle it and there's so many I have so many different girls that I need that each one I'd really love to hang out with but you have so many options that you become paralyzed by choice and you almost don't know which one you know you have so many options that you end up choosing nothing and then you add on top of that the whole scheduling issues with your your occupation you know your professional life your friends your family making demands on your time and so what ends up happening is you just don't end up seeing any of them unless you actually make time like take specific time to make time for that specific individual so so it made me think this is actually probably what girls are experiencing like I'd become like a girl in that I have so many fucking options you know this girl they're getting bombarded with offers from dudes left and right all the time and so when they're not calling you back it's not out of some malicious like desire to to fuck you over or like show you or like make you wait playing weird games it's just that they don't have fucking time for it they simply do not have time for it so it's interesting because once I realize that I stopped getting butthurt about it when a girl didn't call me back you know it's really crazy I just realize for you to actually meet up with a girl a very specific confluence of circumstances has to take place like you have to click really well to begin with okay and then you know your schedules just have to like align with the Stars so again what is the answer to that get more girls really that's the bottom line not obsessing over any single one get more girls that's one of the basic tenets of the of the pickup community is not putting an overly you know in over an undue amount of importance on any particular girl before you've actually hooked up because you're able you know you can you can really internalize this once you have experienced what their experience on their side of the coin okay so I know that Owen has a lot of ideas on this too so I'm going to tag him in right here and and we'll see what he has to has to say about that so you want to hop on in and I'll kind of like just show it off to the side all right so I you know I guess the one thing that I would add to it or I guess the one thing I'd add to this as far as things like misogyny is it's very very very interesting topic okay because right off the bat anything that becomes from a place of being wounded is obviously super pathetic people can immediately sense when you're coming from a wounded place and typically misogynists are coming from a wounded place now on the flip side I remember there was a buddy my name's Scott and they were having a discussion on the forums and someone was saying how you know once you finally truly love women that is when you will get laid the most okay when you truly come from a place of love for women and a lot of people are kind of jumping on the bandwagon of that saying like of course of course but Scott how to answer this sort of blew my mind Scott said actually look I know lots of guys are complete naturals that absolutely fucking hate women and still get laid all the time and I thought that was kind of funny and he said look I made you reason why is because a lot of really really hot girls know that their brass and so when guys freaking like a princess they feel like the guys being incongruent they feel like he's not keeping it real whereas a guy who kind of hates on girls if he's also like a cool really funny really high status guy and obviously he likes them too if he's sleeping with them but he kind of has like that bit of misogyny in him a lot of time women will find that attractive because they're keeping it real now do I agree with that you know I don't know but I just thought it was interesting thought experiment okay there's just a interesting alternative view on it I would say what I what I think is definitely a long line so much Jeff is saying whenever you see people like bitches ain't shit you're like okay bro that's cool to say that but are you getting laid like you have to actually be getting laid to be able to say something like that and have it have any credibility saying things that are misogynistic when you're not getting laid just looks super pathetic if you're not getting what you want from women being butthurt about it is super pathetic so get over that but I guess beyond that there is that cool sort of alternate perspective that women do want you to keep it real if a hot girl knows that she's a bit of a brat calling her out on it can be a good thing having a little bit of that undertone you know knowing that you know she can be a bit full of shit is a good thing a lot of timing when you got a hot girlfriend she'll act up on you and you can just like really like sweetie cutie talk to me because it sounds like a load of bullshit to me and the girls like oh my god okay you're right it's true you know and then she's like massively in love with you for the fact that you called her out and actually if she gets turned on by that so it's an interesting complex issue but definitely anything coming from a wounded place you got to weed that out you have to learn how to weed out your own personal wounds that people have inflicted on you whether it's your father people in life or anything like that your views against the harshness of humanity and the cruelty of it all and all that shit you got to get over that and learn to love life and beyond that you know as far as women yeah don't be wounded you know coming from that kind of frame it's look super lame unneeded unnecessary it's mad sounding so to kind of wrap up here it goes back to one of my little mottos which is get more girls and you know I say that for many reasons but with especially germane to what we're talking about here is how doing volume actually puts you into the mindset of a woman okay and it allows you to see how they how they actually make decisions about who they hang out with you know they're getting hit up by so many dudes all the time that just becomes this like smear of masculinity and the bad like background noise or like the weather or something this is why getting butthurt or showing any sort of emotional reaction to her not wanting to hang out with you immediately we're not responding to you in a timely fashion is like just wreaks a massive massive insecurity it's absolutely disgusting it's like a retarded overreaction and I'm sure you've done this before like with the girl didn't respond for a while and then you'll send something like I mean I've done it like you'll send something you were like well fine then hey you know we could have been together but you know I would have been cool to you you know some kind of retarded like shit and then she's like hey I was at my friend's house or something I didn't see your text so we stand out from that by learning social dynamics and learning the principles and applying them correctly but even then you still have to take into account that this is their reality and deal with it accordingly okay and not get all butthurt about shit and be some fucking massages now and ultimately also you have to ask ask yourself how do you want to like what kind of person do you want to be you want to be this like butthurt little troll who's like living this bitter universe of pain and dismay or do you want to just fucking see things how they are and deal with it you want to be the cause under things in the environment or the effect of things in the environment now you know ultimately I would say if you're gonna if you're going to hate don't be a misogynist be a misanthrope like me fuck all of you bitches ain't shit [Music] Oh stupid  [Music],zyoGGUXP7EM
